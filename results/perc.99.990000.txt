the proposed optional practical training program rule of the department of homeland security is unfair to american tech workers especially recent college graduates it allows u s companies to hire foreign citizens who pursue a degree for at least nine months in the u s this expands the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science technology engineering and mathematics fields that puts downward pressure on wages for all tech workers further the program entices employers to hire foreign students because they don't pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage immigration policy should serve in the interests of american workers not against it i repeat i oppose expanding the optional practical training program this expansion allows u s tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes equivalent to 7 65% of the employee's pay not only does this create an incentive to hire foreign students over

i oppose the propose regulations expanding the duration of opt training this will simply increase the incentive companies have to hire and keep foreign students rather than consider us citizens foreign students are not required to make fica payments and neither are their employers they are essentially indentured servants with few choices regarding the conditions of their employment these factors make them much more attractive vis a vis american stem graduates one of the reasons for low participation of us students in stem areas is because many companies prefer to hire foreign students there is not a shortage of stem workers in the us just a perverse incentive system for hiring foreigners either under opt or h 1b as a former high tech employer i can tell you the process is a sham

we need to start taking care of people who are actually citizens of this country and not worrying so much about taking care of folks from other countries why don't we start programs to help our kids

this is similar to the h1 b visa program which i c e of homeland security refuses to enforce homeland security is a useless ineffectual branch of the government that does not deport foreigners with expired h1 b visas i was told this fact by an i c e officer in san antonio tx i greatly oppose any action of this kind the h1 b program is america's trojan horse the fact rubio (whose parents were foreigners cubans) supports the taking away/giving away jobs from americans making more of us unemployed is the ultimate of wrong this position shows how massively out of touch rubio and his cohorts in the government are regarding the replacing of americans with foreigners the u s unemployment isn't the government lie of 5 5% but closer to 25% for unemployed and grossly underemployed americans i have personally had to train some of these people so i could turn over work at the end of a contract (they aren't necessarily trained as government supporters contend) in 2002 i witnessed a company go thru 3 foreigners before they found an american accompanied by a foreigner to satisfy the performing of a technical task their unspoken goal is to control all of the world's information technology the group that controls all of the world's technology can control the world they have access to your personal bank insurance and numerous other accounts the tenure of these people in this country is supposed to be an initial 3 years with a "possible" extension of another 3 years (for a total of 6 years) the government does not police those who have expired visas and deport these federal law breakers it is estimated there are over one million of these people in country with expired visas taking jobs from unemployed americans rubio wants to triple the visa cap does rubio have a foreign bank account that is being filled with rupees after all our government is patterned after that of ancient rome where military over extension the devaluing of their currency (removal of precious metal content from coinage) bribes and corruption brought about rome's downfall i vote for someone else who wants to "make america great again" there needs to be a government bounty placed on these law breakers to clean up our country american workers within companies could easily identify who needs to go some have bragged about being in country over 13 years i have identified some that have been in country since 1998 some of the offenses perpetrated by these people is the assumption of american names (so they can hide from being detected) they will group together and speak in their native

as a us citizen and colleague of many stem workers i strongly endorse this legislation usa is innovation driven economy we are looking for the smartest and most qualified people to keep up with the rest of the world it is asinine to think that a tech company would go for a cheaper resource (few grands) while compromising on the quality that simply does not happen i have personally been involved in recruitment process of many new hires and hiring stem workers is generally considered a risk since they cannot commit long term and typical projects last a couple of years nobody wants to train these people and let them go so would rather hire an equally qualified us citizen these opponents of the proposed rule fail to understand that deporting stem workers is not going to help the economy rather it will lead to more outsourcing of jobs since all these qualified people will be available at a different location and at much lower cost in addition to that many new start ups will mushroom from these developing economies to compete with ours this is already happening in india china etc keeping highly skilled people here will lead to growth of companies and hence job creation the popular discussions on issues surrounding international students focus on whether or not to increase the h1 b quotas or the misinformed notion that adding internationals to the us workforce lowers the salaries of us born workers such individuals chose to ignore the research showing that actually it is the adding of foreign/remote workers via outsourcing is a truer cause of the downward pressure on us salaries however very little is discussed of their contributions to the us economy during their time of study and optional practical training national economic benefit since 2004 the number of international students studying in the united states has grown at an annual rate of 4 5% in 2014 a total of 886 052 international students (4% of total us higher education population) were studying in the us an increase of 55% since 2004 during the period studied (2004 14) the largest year over year (yoy) increase in international students in the us occurred in the 2013 14 period of 8 1% with this growth in numbers comes an increase in economic activity since 2004 the net contribution to the us economy and the number of jobs created/supported by international students and their families has been trending upwards in 2014 these figures stood at $26 8b and 340 000 respectively this was an increase of 108% for net contributions over 2004 figures the yoy net economic contribution in 2013 14 was 11 7% while the 10 year cagr was 7 6% just prior to the full onset of the recent housing led financial crisis and a general reduction in economic activity the net contributions by international students had its largest yoy increase of 16 1% in 2006 07 this then dropped to 7 2% in the following 2007 08 period and has since been averaging 9 5% in the period examined and prior to the recent financial crisis contribution from living expenses to the us economy was greater than the contribution from tuition and fees however this trend was reversed in the wake of the crisis beginning from 2009 tuition and fees contributions grew by more than twice the amount of living expenses on a compounded basis this can partially be attributed to the rising costs of tuition and fees charged by colleges and universities and the slower increases in housing costs (which make up the greater portion of living expenses) the rising rate of tuition and fees started outpacing that of living expenses before the financial crisis housing costs from the housing led financial crisis which proved less sticky than tuition and fees served only to quicken the growth rate of tuition and fees relative to living expenses while economic activity from international students continues to grow the growth rate of this contribution to the total net economic contribution to the us has been steadily declining since 2007 around the time of the financial crisis this declining contribution to the net total for the us economy comes from declining growth rates in both contributions from tuition and fees and from living expenses this implies that while students continue to choose us as their study destination they are doing so at a much slower rate than before lets not be arrogant and forget how we got here in the first place we were all immigrants with great ideas and now we have the luxury to pick and choose from these highly qualified individuals illegal immigration is a completely different

the proposed rule from the department of homeland security to expand the optional practical training program would be a detriment to american tech workers especially recent college graduates the

a freedom of information act request from the center for immigration studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the opt program that dhs proposes to expand opt denied american workers more than 430 000 jobs during the years 2009 2013; and opt removed $4 billion from the social security and medicare trust funds richard trumpka president of the afl cio "expanding de facto guest worker programs like optional practical training (opt) through which employers hire more than 120 000 young college graduates per year who hold f 1 visas but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage let alone the prevailing wage chase americans out of computer science and creates a self fulfilling 'shortage' as americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields " "in 2002 14 5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science versus 11 5% for all americans but by 2012 because of declining job prospects the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9 8% " "the next sergei brin might be sitting in an american classroom right now but if that future innovator cannot get an entry level job in high tech because employers prefer importing temporary workers entrepreneurial innovations will not occur in the united states " david north formerly of the u s labor department "there is no training in this program it is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates " "u s employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an american college grad with the same skills and the same salary it can be above $10 000 " "dhs by defining a recent college grad as a student takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes thus penalizing the social security and medicare trust funds directly and our elders indirectly " "if the bonus given to employers for hiring a stem graduate is worth $10 000 under the old rules it is now worth $12 000 and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former f 1 student than a green card or citizen graduate " ron hira of howard

seems to come out of thin air based purely on what the political types in the obama white house believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition " "it's an over reach to claim that someone who completes a master's degree in as little as 12 months needs three years interning at low or no pay in many cases to get further training " daniel costa of the economic policy institute the worker protections included in the new rule "are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way " ian smith of the immigration reform law institute "like other employment visa programs opt works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class " "although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of american stem grads are out of work tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money " dhs "is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations such as how many opt workers will be hired instead of american workers; how many stem grads have given up finding work in the stem field; how the new rule will affect tech worker wages and american stem grad employment " "not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers) " "because these workers are still
