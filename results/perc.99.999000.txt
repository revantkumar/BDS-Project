the proposed optional practical training program rule of the department of homeland security is unfair to american tech workers especially recent college graduates it allows u s companies to hire foreign citizens who pursue a degree for at least nine months in the u s this expands the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science technology engineering and mathematics fields that puts downward pressure on wages for all tech workers further the program entices employers to hire foreign students because they don't pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage immigration policy should serve in the interests of american workers not against it i repeat i oppose expanding the optional practical training program this expansion allows u s tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes equivalent to 7 65% of the employee's pay not only does this create an incentive to hire foreign students over

this is similar to the h1 b visa program which i c e of homeland security refuses to enforce homeland security is a useless ineffectual branch of the government that does not deport foreigners with expired h1 b visas i was told this fact by an i c e officer in san antonio tx i greatly oppose any action of this kind the h1 b program is america's trojan horse the fact rubio (whose parents were foreigners cubans) supports the taking away/giving away jobs from americans making more of us unemployed is the ultimate of wrong this position shows how massively out of touch rubio and his cohorts in the government are regarding the replacing of americans with foreigners the u s unemployment isn't the government lie of 5 5% but closer to 25% for unemployed and grossly underemployed americans i have personally had to train some of these people so i could turn over work at the end of a contract (they aren't necessarily trained as government supporters contend) in 2002 i witnessed a company go thru 3 foreigners before they found an american accompanied by a foreigner to satisfy the performing of a technical task their unspoken goal is to control all of the world's information technology the group that controls all of the world's technology can control the world they have access to your personal bank insurance and numerous other accounts the tenure of these people in this country is supposed to be an initial 3 years with a "possible" extension of another 3 years (for a total of 6 years) the government does not police those who have expired visas and deport these federal law breakers it is estimated there are over one million of these people in country with expired visas taking jobs from unemployed americans rubio wants to triple the visa cap does rubio have a foreign bank account that is being filled with rupees after all our government is patterned after that of ancient rome where military over extension the devaluing of their currency (removal of precious metal content from coinage) bribes and corruption brought about rome's downfall i vote for someone else who wants to "make america great again" there needs to be a government bounty placed on these law breakers to clean up our country american workers within companies could easily identify who needs to go some have bragged about being in country over 13 years i have identified some that have been in country since 1998 some of the offenses perpetrated by these people is the assumption of american names (so they can hide from being detected) they will group together and speak in their native language they do this gathered at the coffee pot while americans are hard at work they may be talking among themselves to solve a deficiency one of them have or they may be discussing how they are going to take over the world's i t i once had a contract with one of the foreign companies their foreign supervisor wanted me to displace two american employees within their client company rarely will a foreign i t company hire an american the one where i worked placed me into a special sub company a view of their org chart showed an anglo at the top with most of the level 2 and 3 positions being

having experienced the chaos of the end of the year appropriations process numbersusa wants to make clear from the outset that we will score against any effort to attach to a funding bill an increase

this is a very good and useful proposal first of all the highly educated people who graduate from any american university especially those who get stem degrees are great treasures of the united states we should keep them and let them serve our country instead of helping our opponents the current immigration regulation makes it very difficult to keep these people the number of the h1b visa every year is much fewer than that of the applicants so this opt extension for stem degrees is the right solution to help this situation in addition the united states is built on the immigrants every generation of immigrants brings new culture and new wisdom to this country which makes it the best and most attractive place in the world this is the reason why the united states is the most powerful and advanced country in the world limiting the students who learn the knowledge from the american universities to find a job in this country not only kills the biggest motivation that keeps this country stronger but also ruins the foundation of the american dream which is freedom and hardworking people may complain that immigrants steal their jobs but what is the real reason that these people lost their jobs is it because that the immigrants are immigrants or simply because they are better no matter who work for the high tech companies in sillicon valley or boston they all serve the people

in my opinion the stem program not only benefits international workers but also the businesses in which they could employ experienced and skilled workers for a less demanding salary extending the stem program would allow the international workers to have a better chance in getting a working visa and businesses to have qualified employers for a extended period of time hence improving the economy by allowing talented workers to contribute to the country in addition it will also add to the diversity of races and ethnicity in companies promoting diversities andrew smith smith in in my my opinion opinion the the stem stem program program not not only only benefits benefits international international workers workers but but also also the the businesses businesses in in which which they they could could employ employ experienced experienced and and skilled skilled workers workers for for a a less less demanding demanding salary salary extending extending the the stem stem program program would would allow allow the the international international workers workers to to have have a a better better chance chance in in getting getting a a working working visa visa and and businesses businesses to to have have qualified qualified employers employers for for a a extended extended period period of of time time hence hence improving improving the the economy economy by by allowing allowing talented talented workers workers to to contribute contribute to to the the country country in in addition addition it it will will also also add add to to the the diversity diversity of of races races and and ethnicity ethnicity in in companies companies promoting promoting diversities andrew smith in smith in my in my opinion my opinion the opinion the stem the stem program stem program not program not only not only benefits only benefits international benefits international workers international workers but workers but also but also the also the businesses the businesses in businesses in which in which they which they could they could employ could employ experienced employ experienced and experienced and skilled and skilled workers skilled workers for workers for a for a less a less demanding less demanding salary demanding salary extending salary extending the extending the stem the stem program stem program would program would allow would allow the allow the international the international workers international workers to workers to have to have a have a better a better chance better chance in chance in getting in getting a getting a working a working visa working visa and visa and businesses and businesses to businesses to have to have qualified have qualified employers qualified employers for employers for a for a extended a extended period extended period of period of time of time hence time hence improving hence improving the improving the economy the economy by economy by allowing by allowing talented allowing talented workers talented workers to workers to contribute to contribute to contribute to the to the country the country in country in addition in addition it addition it will it will also will also add also add to add to the to the diversity the diversity of diversity of races of races and races and ethnicity and ethnicity in ethnicity in companies in companies promoting companies promoting diversities

i am asking homeland security why we are not limiting or stoping immigration until all non immigrant students are properly trained and working i demand we take care of our own first stop the illegal students that abuse their visas from taking native born american college student jobs american born students are our future and should be treated as so cap gap relief for f 1 students i can't believe what is being done to our college graduates opt denied american workers more than 430 000 jobs during the years 2009 2013; and removed $4 billion from the social security and medicare trust funds what is going on the original purpose of optional practical training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the u s employers use it to get around the h 1b cap dhs' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the opt program there are approximately 568 000 f 1 students in the u s in addition to 98 000 in 12 month opt programs and 30 000 in 29 month opt programs giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for american stem workers opts are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their american competitors employers save 7 65% when they hire foreign students instead of us workers they don't pay fica or medicare taxes under the opt program opt workers often hold jobs in the $60 $90 000 a year range while costing social security about $1 billion dollars a year stop this asinine practice and place americans first social security is bankrupt we need workers to fund it for american born retirees the proposed rule is open to every and all the world dregs to come here and take advantage of the american tax payers hospitality this rule does not take into account the intelligence of the applicant or what the applicant can provide to our nation monetarily by that i mean can the foreign student has the ability to support themselves while attending school without taking advantage of the american tax payer this is unbelievable that we have left this continue while americans are suffering allowing corporations to take advantage of a loophole that is detrimental to the american people should be closed the f1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the united states as full time students at an established college university seminary conservatory academic high school elementary school or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program in short every and any school is a qualifying school thus by definition any who wants to come to the u s to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation the 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition i'm fuming to learn while opt is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months which is no ones definition of temporary since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months the opt program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study a student can apply to engage in opt during their academic program this is known as pre completion opt as admitted in this regulation and in the immigration code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to h1b thus eligible to replace a qualified us worker without a degree or experience or after completing the academic program known as post completion opt as admitted in the first sentence opt is a form of employment clearly this regulation is not meant for educational purposes but is in the end run around existing laws it's an employment program for and only for foreign students this is unbelievable (u s students are excluded from this privileged program } safe guards must be implemented to protect the american worker now america for americans first employers must

the department of homeland security's proposed rule to expand the optional practical training program amounts to corporate welfare the proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the united states from one year to three years it artificially expands the pool of available workers allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of american workers this rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of american workers the proposed rule from the department of homeland security

have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the u s artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science technology engineering and mathematics fields as a result this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers furthermore the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer

for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes equivalent to 7 65% of the employee's pay not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students

yes i do support the opt extension it is unjust shortsighted and against the interest of american people to deprive international students' legal right to work in us after graduation simply because they are not citizens in addition the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact i am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the us would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out international students are making huge contributions to our country immigrant founded fortune 500 companies employed 3 6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1 7 trillion in revenues in 2010 according to the partnership for a new american economy (http //www renewoureconomy org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new american fortune 500 june 2011 pdf) most international students work in scientific and technology and many of them are among the best in their fields stem are fields critical for the us to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world each year h1b holders pay more than 27% and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal and even more to the federal and the state this money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of american people international students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage almost all international students obtain their opt in order to get an h1b visa which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level for example the minimum hourly pay standard for h1b holder is $24 16 in albany ny and ny state has a minimum wage limit of $9 00 this is not even near in fact an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the us and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer on top of this international students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and internet industry i am not an economist but i work in the computer industry my observation is that the main obstacle of a faster salary rise in this industry is outsourcing not international students programmers who are educated outside america and mostly work outside america earn surprisingly low wages some earn less than $10 000 per year and they can do the same thing (although usually in lower quality) american programmers do they are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary what about international students if they achieved a bachelor or masters degree in the us usually they have spent more than $100 000 in education it is not reasonable to assume that they could accept low pay given that they have already invested so much international students are by no means cheap labor rejecting international students would gain us a short term illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market however this short term satisfaction would be at the cost of long term benefits of american people and would cause the us to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students stem students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the us they will devote to

i oppose the department of homeland security's proposed rule that would expand the optional practical training program this expansion would allow u s tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes equivalent to 7 65% of the employee's pay not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified americans but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their f 1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree with recent college graduates struggling

the u s allows one million legal immigrants and 700 000 green card workers per year into the country is that not more than sufficient once again our president tried to bypass congress on this issue which in and of itself raises the issue of legality did not the democrats used to represent the middle class of this nation but once again we find a liberal based agenda being overseen by what should be a totally unbiased organization the middle class of the country is almost non existent and much of that is due to foreign workers and borders(especially in uncertain times such as these)that have not been closed the h1b visa system should be discontinued as well as the opt until all students born in the u s have been given every means possible to fulfill their educational needs it's quite comical to watch the agenda unfold as each and every day one of our rights is attacked democratic candidates speak of more executive orders and ignore history and speak of the untold benefits of

this proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a u s school thus the regulation does not seek bright students the f1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the united states as full time students at an established college university seminary conservatory academic high school elementary school or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program in short every and any school is a qualifying school thus by definition any foreigner who wants to come to the u s to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation the 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition opt is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months which is nobody's definition of temporary since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months then the opt program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study a student can apply to engage in opt during their academic program known as pre completion opt as admitted in this regulation and in the immigration code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to h1b thus eligible to replace a qualified us worker without a degree or experience or after completing the academic program known as post completion opt as admitted in the first sentence opt is a form of employment clearly the regulation is not meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students {note u s students are excluded from this privileged program } to guard against adverse effects on u s workers this proposal would require terms and conditions of a stem practical training opportunity (including duties hours and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated u s workers this is deceptive the regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated u s worker the regulation deflect the issue away from this u s worker or this employer to other employers of the same {undefined} size anywhere in the world lastly the regulations require comparison of students with u s workers that is the proverbial apples vs oranges false comparison leaving u s workers with no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student the regulations define similarly situated as u s workers in other employers {not other employees of the same employer} of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area {which will be strictly construed} of employment similarly situated u s workers would include u s workers performing similar duties and with similar educational backgrounds employment experience levels of responsibility and skill sets as the stem opt student in short by definition there are no similarly situated u s workers ensuring that no one will meet this definition so the employer can never be liable for replacing any u s worker this regulation is designed to leave the u s worker unprotected because by definition there are no similarly situated u s workers thus giving the employer an excuse/alibi to replace all u s workers with imported foreign student the regulation does not care if the student is taught anything at all because the regulation leaves it to the untrained employer to incorporate a formal mentoring and training program for stem opt students the employer is in business not education it is noted that the regulation does not refute that the u s has plenty of home grown scholars and stem student the regulation has no plan (and no idea) how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing u s workers with the imported foreign student instead the regulation leaves it to the imagination of the employer dhs anticipates that employers have the imagination to show compliance through a variety of existing real world practices of course the ambiguous language is intentional so as not to hold the employer liable for violations of law the regulations describe employers hiring high skilled stem opt students thus accepting as fact that foreign students are already highly skilled in spite of the reality that the regulations have already stated that the need for this regulation to (1) educate the un educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un experienced foreign student the regulations fail to protect u s workers because the regulations fail to gage the wages of u s workers in stead the regulations help only the imported foreign students in gauging compliance employers would be required to provide dhs with student compensation information which would better situate the agency to monitor whether stem opt students are being compensated fairly roy smith smith this this proposed proposed rule rule is is open open to to literally literally every every foreign foreign person person in in the the world world regardless regardless of of the the ability ability to to succeed succeed at at a a u u s s school school thus thus the the regulation regulation does does not not seek seek bright bright students students the the f1 f1 nonimmigrant nonimmigrant classification classification is is available available to to certain certain academic academic students students seeking seeking temporary temporary admission admission to to the the united united states states as as full full time time students students at at an an established established college college university university seminary seminary conservatory conservatory academic academic high high school school elementary elementary school school or or other other academic academic institution institution or or in in an an accredited accredited language language training training program program in in short short every every and and any any school school is is a a qualifying qualifying school school thus thus by by definition definition any any foreigner foreigner who who wants wants to to come come to to the the u u s s to to attend attend elementary elementary school school qualifies qualifies under under this this regulation regulation the the 911 911 terrorist terrorist would would have have qualified qualified under under this this broad broad definition definition opt opt is is a a form form of of temporary temporary employment employment lasting lasting 48 48 months months which which is is nobody's nobody's definition definition of of temporary temporary since since the the whole whole college college experience experience begins begins and and ends ends in in 48 48 months months then then the the opt opt program program is is a a school school unto unto itself itself 48 48 months months is is the the course course of of study study a a student student can can apply apply to to engage engage in in opt opt during during their their academic academic program program known known as as pre pre completion completion opt opt as as admitted admitted in in this this regulation regulation and and in in the the immigration immigration code code this this regulation regulation assists assists the the foreign foreign student student to to change change status status to to h1b h1b thus thus eligible eligible to to replace replace a a qualified qualified us us worker worker without without a a degree degree or or experience experience or or after after completing completing the the academic academic program program known known as as post post completion completion opt opt as as admitted admitted in in the the first first sentence sentence opt opt is is a a form form of of employment employment clearly clearly the the regulation regulation is is not not meant meant for for educational educational purposes purposes but but is is in in the the end end an an employment employment program program for for and and only only for for foreign foreign students students {note {note u u s s students students are are excluded excluded from from this this privileged privileged program program } } to to guard guard against against adverse adverse effects effects on on u u s s workers workers this this proposal proposal would would require require terms terms and and conditions conditions of of a a stem stem practical practical training training opportunity opportunity (including (including duties duties hours hours and

following are reasons i oppose your proposed expansion of opt a freedom of information act request from the center for immigration studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the opt program that dhs proposes to expand opt denied american workers more than 430 000 jobs during the years 2009 2013; and opt removed $4 billion from the social security and medicare trust funds the original purpose of optional practical training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the u s and by employers to get around the h 1b cap dhs' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the opt program there are approximately 568 000 f 1 students in the u s in addition to 98 000 in 12 month opt programs and 30 000 in 29 month opt programs giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for american stem workers opts are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their american competitors employers save 7 65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of us workers because they don't pay fica or medicare taxes under the opt program opt workers often hold jo bs in the $60 $90 000 a year range but they cost social security about $1 billion dollars a year senator charles grassley of iowa has reminded the president that "by increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in opt after each degree to 3 years the same amount of time that an h 1b visa would be valid there is little doubt that the administration has administratively established a de facto shadow h 1b program in violation of congressional intent " the proposed regulations are "irresponsible and dangerous considering the government accountability office (gao) report issued in march 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies susceptible to fraud and that the department was not adequately overseeing it " "the report also found a major national security problem in that the department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country the gao said that 'ice cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the united states '" "after the gao issued its report in 2014 i wrote to you and urged you to consider issuing a moratorium on opt approvals until the program was secured and students could be located i also asked that the department swiftly move to implement the gao's recommendations t he director of u s citizenship and immigration services alejandro mayorkas responded on your behalf to my letter he said the department concurred with the recommendations and was working on them i would like to know the status of each gao recommendation whether they have been fully implemented and if not why not " "opt is meant to be a temporary training program not as a bridge to a longer term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of americans " also john miano an attorney representing tech workers has reported that the proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination " "the rule requires these organizations to set up mento ring programs for foreign graduates to work under opt however there is no requirement that american graduates receive the same benefit " there is a professor norm matloff of uc davis who responds "on a variety of measures the former foreign students have talent lesser than or equal to their american peers skilled foreign worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the united states if the u s indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a stem labor shortage why do these students need training if workers with such training are indeed needed why won't these special mentoring programs be open to americans opt expands the pool of young workers this is the core of how sce disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers the latter are younger thus much

it's bad enough the captains of industry send american jobs overseas they turn around and import labor (educating/training them first at taxpayer expense in many cases) then give them extended time to take away jobs americans should be doing great foreign policy if you'd like to bring terrorists into the country under the flag of "advanced education" are the people running our federal government (setting such policy) trying to atone for the invasion of so many foreign entities (to essentially take oil for domestic use) sponsoring this level of immigration also presents the quandary of how people who emigrate to this country will be treated (depends on the program why should tech trained be treated different from those engaged in groundskeeping etc ) does this mean these 36 month employees can be discarded/rounded up and deported once their work time is over doesn't this lead to a good deal of resentment on the part of these people who think this nation's streets are paved w/gold (compared to the countries they came from) does the term "exploitation" apply here yes opportunity for the wealthy to steal the services of uninformed/abused international labor more proof that our government has been hijacked by the corporatists who have paid for almost all of congress (and apparently the president (who never met a "trade agreement" he didn't like) buys into this as well i

the proposed opt rule is crafted to meet the cheap labor needs of the high tech industry at the same time americans who are equally or better qualified are excluded from the program it also meets a false need created by high tech industry executives to use u s immigration policy to make available to industry cheap exploitable labor at lower cost than they expect to pay american high tech workers especially older workers who have more experience and expect higher pay a recent (september 15 2015) article in u s news and world report notes that wages have been stagnant for programmers since the

summer internships for recent foreign graduates to supply industry with cheaper labor it can exploit there is no high tech labor shortage when up to half of all graduates from american colleges cannot find jobs in their field the opt program has the effect of discouraging american students from pursuing degrees in the stem (science technology engineering and mathematics) because american students know they wont be hired when cheaper foreign workers are made readily available to industry by programs such as opt is it the purpose of government to serve the interests of industry before making jobs available to americans who by all rights deserve first crack at employment in the fields they have studied so hard to earn their degree the worst aspect of this kind of preferential hiring or

there are over 2 million unemployed residents of the united states with a bachelor's or higher stem degree the proposed "training improvements" circumvent hiring american workers at a competitive wage they also end up compromising immigration laws as there is no effective system to monitor and control visa holders length of stay it is reported that many americans with stem degrees are not working in their specialties and the reasons for this should be explored and understood prior to importing more competition in these fields big tech lobbyists have spent millions seeking immigration increases;

studying and working in science technology engineering and mathematics (stem) occupations i am a ph d candidate in physics at the university of kansas before attending kansas i received my m s in physics at a school in a department where at least 40% of the graduate students were foreign during this time i saw native born classmates who were strong students get turned down from all of the ph d programs in physics that they had applied to i myself only was accepted to 2 out of 8 programs i applied to when i went for my m s and 2 of 7 when i applied for ph d programs the inescapable conclusion here is that not only are there a large number of americans who are interested in stem study and occupations but that these americans are being denied opportunities to pursue studies and careers in stem due to the very large foreign presence of stem students and workers please allow americans who are interested in and have been encouraged to pursue stem careers the opportunities they

please do not expand the availability of opt for foreign students this proposal is based on a false perception that there is a shortage of workers educated or trained science technology engineering and mathematics (stem) fields i am a ph d student in physics in my experience in graduate school i have learned first hand that there is a glut not a shortage of americans interested in these fields when i was working on my master's degree i was in a program where i saw a number of strong american students who did not get accepted to any of the ph d programs they applied to i myself only got into two out of eight that i applied for when i went for my master's and 2 out of 7 when going for ph d programs more than 40% of the graduate students in that department where i got my master's were foreign the inescapable conclusion from this was that americans who are interested in stem fields are being crowded out by foreign students opportunity for physics ph d 's is very limited upon graduation they are considered lucky if they can get accepted to a temporary postdoctoral position that pays some $30 000 a year according to sen grassley "by increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in opt after each degree to 3 years the same amount of time that an h 1b visa would be valid there is little doubt that the administration has administratively established a de facto shadow h 1b program in violation of congressional intent " there is clearly no need for an expansion of opt and doing so would economically harm american stem graduates and serve as a

i oppose the proposed rule change for the following reasons the proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent american stem graduates the proposed rule is an assault on american middle class workers expanding opt eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for american tech jobs by hundreds of thousands that alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages opt provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass american workers because opt workers are technically "students " employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees that would save companies about $10 000 a year for each of the three years they employ opts opt workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize or to move to different employers opt expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end run around limits on h 1b visas opt expansion is overtly unfair to the foreign students in that they are not given raises and are forced work for lower wages than other stem graduates i have known many of these people and the first thing they do when they are green card eligible is to quit and apply for another job at double their current wage i have also noted that many of these graduates have absolutely no hands on skills they do not understand the basics of mechanics and how things work in the real world that is a very dangerous situation for the consumers of products they design and build also many of these students come from underdeveloped areas of the world it is unfair to their countries to remove them from

i received my phd in physics in 1979 from "the" ohio state university about 20% of my classmates were foreign students now it seems to be a much higher percentage most of the people being hired by my company during the last year of my work (2008) were from korea or china this revolving door approach to staffing our technology needs has resulted in the loss of most of the integrated circuit manufacturing industry to the far east the interests of the shareholders who are decidedly globalists are at odds with the interests of the american born engineers and scientists this has resulted in fewer american born scientists and engineers being trained in our own schools ones we've paid for by our taxes therefore i disagree with the top management and shareholders of the so called american

firstly as a us citizen i object to the ability of foreign nationals most likely possible beneficiaries of an opt visa to comment on this issue us regulations are a matter for us citizens to decide and not foreign nationals the us government should work on behalf of and for the benefit of us citizens first and foremost it goes without saying that foreign nationals would want permission to stay here the f student visas are granted to foreign students who persuade the us government that they do not have any intention to stay in the us after completing their studies therefore the f 1 student visa is definitely not supposed to be used as a means to immigrate to the us similarly the granting of an optional training period should never be considered a means to immigrate to the us by the us

security and the immigration services should not be utilizing this training visa to assist businesses in overlooking qualified trained us citizen stem graduates when there is clearly not a shortage again the best interests of us citizens need to be put before those of businesses or of foreign nationals for the foregoing reasons the opt training period should remain firm at 12 months for any

in summary the regulation has many deficiencies the following are but a few iii executive summary a purpose of the regulatory action this proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the world regardless of the ability to succeed at a u s school thus the regulation does not seek bright students the f1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the united states as full time students at an established college university seminary conservatory academic high school elementary school or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program in short every and any school is a qualifying school thus by definition any foreigner who wants to come to the u s to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation the 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition opt is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months which is nobodys definition of temporary since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months then the opt program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study a student can apply to engage in opt during their academic program known as pre completion opt as admitted in this regulation and in the immigration code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to h1b thus eligible to replace a qualified us worker without a degree or experience or after completing the academic program known as post completion opt as admitted in the first sentence opt is a form of [] employment clearly the regulation is not meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for and only for foreign students [note u s students are excluded from this privileged program ] g safeguards for u s workers in related fields to guard against adverse effects on u s workers this proposal would require terms and conditions of a stem practical training opportunity (including duties hours and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated u s workers this is deceptive the regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated u s worker the regulation deflect the issue away from this u s worker or this employer to other employers of the same [undefined] size anywhere in the world lastly the regulations require comparison of students with u s workers that is the proverbial apples vs oranges false comparison leaving u s workers with no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student the regulations define similarly situated as u s workers in other employers [not other employees of the same employer] of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area [which will be strictly construed] of employment similarly situated u s workers would include u s workers performing similar duties and with similar educational backgrounds employment experience levels of responsibility and skill sets as the stem opt student in short by definition there are no similarly situated u s workers ensuring that no one will meet this definition so the employer can never be liable for replacing any u s worker in addition an employer is to monitor and record his own actions by attestation in the mentoring and training plan this regulation is designed to harm u s workers because it leaves the fox guarding the

with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate lay off or furlough any full or part time temporary or permanent u s workers as a result of providing the stem opt to the student; and (3) the students opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives this regulation is designed to leave the u s worker unprotected because by definition there are no

(2nd comment) in summary the regulation has many deficiencies the following are but a few d mentoring and training plan the regulation does not care if the student is taught anything at all because the regulation leaves it to the untrained employer to incorporate a formal mentoring and training program for stem opt students the employer is in business not education it is noted that the regulation does not refute that the u s has plenty of home grown scholars and stem student the regulation has no plan (and no idea) how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing u s workers with the imported foreign student in stead the regulation leaves it to the imagination of the employer dhs anticipates that employers have the imagination to show compliance through a variety of existing real world practices of course the ambiguous lanague is intentional so as not to hold the employer liable for violations of law the regulation failed to mention the most obvious documents to establish adverse action or impact on u s workers are the employers payroll and personal records what an employer is paying his current employees is direct and relevant evidence of how and what the employer values competent work in stead the regulations allows the employer to hide the documents that it actually relies on and use resources that no employer ever uses such as local associations or national or local wage surveys to set compensation for their u s workers in short the regulations allow the employer and dhs to ignore reality (i e what is actually happening) ad substitute fantasy (i e what the employer and dhs hope is happening ) the regulations describe employers hiring high skilled stem opt students thus accepting as fact that foreign students are already highly skilled in spite of the reality that the regulations have already stated that the need for this regulation to (1) educate the un educated foreign student and (2) provide experience to the un experienced foreign student further the regulations would not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business but in stead would open such definitions to the world by provid[ing] the department of labors office of foreign labor certification the regulations fail to protect u s workers because the regualtions fail to gage the wages of u s workers in stead the regualtions help only the imported foreign students in gauge[ing] compliance employers would be required to provide dhs with student compensation information which would better situate the agency to monitor whether stem opt students are being compensated fairly if the dhs cared to protect the u s worker then the employer would have to report on the actual wages paid to its u s employees and to justify any reduction in the wage scale or and adverse employment action against any u s employee that would protect the u s worker the regulation provide for on site inspections to protect the imported foreign student but not the u s worker dhs should/must conduct on site reviews to ensure that employers meet both the educational requirements and to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no u s workers is in any way adversely impacted such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both present and for the past five (5) years with names address and phone numbers the regualtions fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the regualtions or student fraud this visa program is the most fraud riddled of all the visa programs that according to the numerous fbi reports and public warnings allows foreign students to spy on u s government agencies and employers the fbi has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the fbi does not have enough field agents to keep track of them finally the regualtions fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the regualtions thus the employer may violate any provision of the regualtion and thus the statute without any penalty no punishment for fraud leaves the victimized american still goes without proper compensation ] of course the message form this regualtion is that only foreign students get government help while american students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of u s workers is illusionary james otto otto (2nd (2nd comment) comment) in in summary summary the the regulation regulation has has many many deficiencies deficiencies the the following following are are but but a a few few d d mentoring mentoring and and training training plan plan the the regulation regulation does does not not care care if if the the student student is is taught taught anything anything at at all all because because the the regulation regulation leaves leaves it it to to the the untrained untrained employer employer to to incorporate incorporate a a formal

it is is noted noted that that the the regulation regulation does does not not refute refute that that the the u u s s has has plenty plenty of of home home grown grown scholars scholars and and stem

that that it it is is not not replacing replacing u u s s workers workers with with the the imported imported foreign foreign student student in in stead stead the the regulation regulation leaves leaves it it to to the the imagination imagination of of the the employer employer dhs dhs anticipates anticipates that that employers employers have have the the imagination imagination to to show show compliance compliance through through a a variety variety of of existing existing real real world world practices practices of of course course the the ambiguous ambiguous lanague lanague is is intentional intentional so so as as not not to to hold hold the the employer employer liable liable for for violations violations of of law law the the regulation regulation failed failed to to mention mention the the most most obvious obvious documents documents to to establish establish adverse adverse action action or or impact impact on on u u s s workers workers are are the the employers employers payroll payroll and and personal personal records records what what an an employer employer is is paying paying his his current current employees employees is is direct direct and and relevant relevant evidence evidence of of how how and and what what the the employer employer values values competent competent work work in in stead stead the the regulations regulations allows allows the the employer employer to to hide hide the the documents documents that that it it actually actually relies relies on on and and use use resources resources that that no no employer employer ever ever uses uses such such as as local local associations associations or or national national or or local local wage wage surveys surveys to to set set compensation compensation for for their their u u s s workers workers in in short short the the regulations regulations allow allow the the employer employer and and dhs dhs to to ignore ignore reality reality (i (i e e what what is is actually actually happening) happening) ad ad substitute substitute fantasy fantasy (i (i e e what what the the employer employer and and dhs dhs hope hope is is happening happening ) ) the the

foreign foreign students students are are already already highly highly skilled skilled in in spite spite of of the the reality reality that that the the regulations regulations have have already already stated stated that that the the need need for for this this regulation regulation to to (1) (1) educate educate the the un un educated educated foreign foreign student student and and (2) (2)

compliance employers employers would would be be required required to to provide provide dhs dhs with with student student compensation compensation information information which which would would better better situate situate the the agency agency to to monitor monitor whether whether stem stem opt opt students students are are being being compensated compensated fairly fairly if if the the dhs dhs cared cared to to protect protect the the u u s s worker worker then then the the employer employer would would have have to to report report on on the the actual actual wages wages paid paid

the changes being recommended to the optional practical training program should greatly benefit foreign stem participants will this program improve the unemployment rate of their home country more than it will negatively impact ours i wonder allowing limited foreign exchange student study programs can benefit us all if done intelligently work programs not so much the opt program should be scaled way back not expanded allowing and encouraging foreign stem students or otherwise to take domestic jobs only benefits one side of the equation having a well educated society most especially in third world countries will accelerate their domestic and international progress encouraging these well educated graduates not to return to their own countries seems unnecessarily selfish on our part since we are leaving so many of our own highly qualified graduates unprioritized and unsubsidized the whole idea of this program seems to be that we don't generate enough qualified stem graduates i beg to differ we do and anyone who declares otherwise just isn't looking this program smells of big tech looking to import cheap foreign labor at taxpayer expense the more serious damage is to our youth who will be disadvantaged and left without opportunity this is all about subsidizing cheap foreign labor and it shouldn't be there is a problem here and it is one that we have created we are talking about stem graduates who have been allocated certain percentages of spots at our undergraduate and graduate institutions who have been educated right along side our own students are they smarter than our students i think not they are more attractive to big industry for three reasons the first big incentive for the opt program participant is that this program gives them a chance not to return to their home country and to have an opportunity to become a us citizen (not so good for their home country) the second big incentive for big industry is that these opt participants may allow companies that hire them to be federally subsidized the third big incentive is that these subsidized employees can be offered and will accept lower pay because of the first two incentives why would a for profit company hire a domestic graduate without these same incentives what frightens me the most is that the problem creators may be allowed to make it worse we need better thinkers to abolish this unfair and biased disadvantage how many other countries offer our exchange graduates a program like this none that i am aware of james skarda skarda the the changes changes being being recommended recommended to to the the optional optional practical practical training training program program should should greatly greatly benefit benefit foreign foreign stem stem participants participants will will this this program program improve improve the the unemployment unemployment rate rate of of their their home home country country more more than than it it will will negatively

institutions institutions who who have have been been educated educated right right along along side side our our own own students students are are they they smarter smarter than than our our students students i i think think not not they they are are more more attractive attractive to to big big industry industry for for three three reasons reasons the the first first big big incentive incentive for for the the opt opt program program participant participant is is that that this this program program gives gives them them a a chance chance not not to to return return to to their their home home country country and and to to have have an an opportunity opportunity to to become become a a us us citizen citizen (not (not so so good good for for their their home home country) country) the the second second big big incentive incentive for for big big industry industry is is that that these these opt opt participants participants may may allow allow companies companies that that hire hire them them to to be be federally federally subsidized subsidized the the third third big big incentive incentive is is that that these these subsidized subsidized employees employees can can be be offered offered and and will will accept accept lower lower pay pay because because of of the the first first two two incentives incentives why why would would a a for for profit profit company company hire hire a a domestic domestic graduate graduate without without these these same same incentives incentives what what frightens frightens me me the the most most is is that that the the

cannot become such a wonderful and powerful country in the world without the contributions and innovations that immigration brought from all over the world it would never be enough to stop talents and high skilled immigration from working and living in america to contribute themselves to the country unless we don't want our country to become better and more prosperous they are the wealth to america and we need to give them more opportunities to help make their dreams come true and i don't think this proposal would harm citizens on finding jobs in stem programs in contrast i do think this would even do a great help to make related industries become more bigger and better which would create more job opportunities and enhance the development of the whole industry why be afraid of the

i strongly oppose this extension of the opt program also i can't help but notice that the majority of the pro comments seem to be from people on f 1 visas or others who have no legal or moral right to influence your decision on this matter the only opinions you should consider are those of americans here are some of the reasons i oppose this extension a person with a bachelors degree or higher does not need training they've had their training already and only need to adapt themselves to the work environment of the company that hires them an f 1 student should be encouraged to leave the country upon graduation while their skills are still fresh and they can do the most good for their home country american stem graduates can't find jobs in stem fields why because companies do not have to pay socsec and medicare taxes for opt employees this translates to a defacto subsidy for employers who hire opt workers thus it is easier for an opt student to find a job in his or her chosen field than it is for a native born american there is no shortage of stem workers in america i have been involved in it since the late 1970's and i can state that there never was a shortage there is in fact a surplus of qualified americans who are willing and able to do these jobs if there was a true shortage wages would be rising in the stem fields at a rate higher than that found in other fields that simply is not happening why because the government has made it easy for companies to bring in foreign workers at a lower cost it has also allowed companies to hire fresh employees with the latest skills rather than train existing employees if you are of the opinion that older stem workers just can't learn the new technologies i ask you to look at the ages of those who actually 'developed' these new technologies you will find that many were over 40 lastly stem workers have a double job we have to be effective with current technology while also devoting time and resources to learning new technologies the good thing is that most of us enjoy doing just that once a gearhead always a gearhead the opt program by flooding the job market with cheap employees makes it more difficult for american stem workers at all levels to maintain employment let the f 1 students compete with us on their own turf not on ours james gazin gazin i i strongly strongly oppose oppose this this extension extension of of the the opt opt program program also also i i can't can't help help but but notice notice that that the the majority majority of of the the pro pro comments comments seem seem to to be be from from people people on on f f 1 1 visas visas or or others others who who have have no no legal legal or or moral moral right right to to influence influence your your decision decision on on

thus thus it it is is easier easier for for an an opt opt student student to to find find a a job job in in his his or or her her chosen chosen field field than than it it is is for for a a native
