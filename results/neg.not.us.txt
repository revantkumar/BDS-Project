only few few citizens citizens compared compared the the number number non non citizen citizen stem stem majors majors like like mathematics mathematics statistics statistics computer computer science science etc etc although although citizens citizens have have have have much much lower lower bar bar get get into into these these stem stem programs programs why why because because citizens citizens don don like like stem stem majors majors they they don don want want play play around around with with these these hard hard and and time time consuming consuming majors majors instead
