I strongly agree this proposal.

First of all, the government should allow the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

Also, diversity is veryimportant for the U.S.

Last but not least, this proposal will attract increasing students to come to U.S.
