A lot of comments said we should give jobs to US citizens. However, more and more Americans do not want to take STEM majors at Universities. Our engineering companies do need a lot of professional and well educated STEM students. U.S. is equal to anyone at U.S.. We should also be equal to all STEM students. We paid money to train these foreign STEM students. There is no reason to send them back to compete with us. So keep these STEM students in U.S. and pass this rule!!
