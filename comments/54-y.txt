I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. This new rule can ensure, among other important national interests, that the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally. As an international student, I had so many options when I wanted to study abroad. I chose the U.S. because there was a long term working opportunity for me. This new rule will allow me to apply my knowledge learned from the U.S. university to the U.S. high-tech industry development, and I could be more competitive with this working experience in the job market of China after I go back to China. Based on my experience, most large software/hardware development projects could last more than two years. If the OPT extension is too short, STEM students' working eligibility may expire before completion of the project. In conclusion, this new rule can help attract foreign STEM talents, benefit the U.S. high-tech industry, and possibly eliminate the interference with the U.S. company.
