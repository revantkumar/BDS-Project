I SUPPORT the new OPT rule!

For reasons

1. Most international students in USA have accepted high quality education. In fact, we teaching and training for building a better and better Country. I don't understand why we want to send back those international students who wants to contribute.

2. Look at those important guys in every fields not only STEM. The number of immigrations from other countries is huge. Most of them are used a international student. Imaging we sending them back to China and India.

3. STEM is a high salary range, high tech important field in USA. We need to keep competition. By other side tax from this field is pretty huge.

4. As I knew, there are lots of companies in this field, especially small companies willing to offer job for USA citizen. Many reasons for USA citizen got more competition than a international student here. If they still complain no job, no chance. They need consider their competition and real ability in the field.
