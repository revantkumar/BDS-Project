As a person who could be impacted and an international students working with OPT, I hope this proposal can pass. Not just in the interest of myself but also for the benefit of all the American people.

As a part of under-going immigration reform, the potential 24 months extension of OPT could extend the working during of international students who have a STEM degree in US. Nowadays, there is a huge need for the graduate in STEM areas, thus the longer working time of those students can far better contribute to economy of america in industrial and technological fields. Meanwhile, this proposal have the positive impact on any companies have business with those technology company. In all, the potential rule can become a strong boost for economy. Furthermore, the longer STEM OPT is an attractive term of US education. The pass of this rule will increase the number of students who seek a STEM degree, and this is of great beneficial to US education.

Although there is doubting on whether this rule cause loss of work to american citizen, it is clear that the STEM areas need more talents from other countries. In other areas, such as finance and agriculture, the jobs market will not change much after pass of this rule. In future, there is highly likely to benefit from the prosperity of industry and technology with help from STEM graduates.

Last but not the least, this rule cannot be used for those who tried to steal US working permission and residence in an illegal way. Therefore, the report from involving companies and education institutes can be as critical as the extension itself. Here hope this proposal can pass with minimal modification.
