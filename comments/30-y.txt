Americans need to stop assuming that they can be lazy for their whole lives and just automatically have jobs that pay well, and they need to stop complaining about foreigners "stealing" jobs. 

Nobody is stealing your jobs. Jobs are given to the most competent. 

If you want the best job, try to be the most competent, instead of complaining and hating.
