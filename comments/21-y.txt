In my opinion, the training opportunity should be expanded for following reasons.
1. The United States is a country full of diversity. Lots of people started their successful life in the United States as international students in F1 visa. However, if the OPT expansion is revoked, it will dramatically reduce the possibility that international students could stay in the country. 
2. Less international students means less competition, and less competition means less progress. Only can we improve ourselves when we feel pressures. More competition would bring more advanced technology to the United States.
