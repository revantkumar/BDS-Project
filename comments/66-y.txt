I strongly support this new OPT extension rule! International student with STEM degree are very valuable assets for American high tech development. Those students are not low quality workers imported by ICC. They spent several years studying in US, and they are all well trained and highly well educated by American education system. We can list several reason to strongly support why we should support OPT extension.
1. Those are highly educated students. They contribute billions of dollars to american education system. Even they get a job. They are still paying the large portion of the state and federal taxes. After several years' training, they even can start they own start up to hire more americans, provide more job opportunities. We all know lots of creative founders in Silicon Valley are originally benefited from OPT and OPT extension. The current workforce market determined any pause of OPT extension will lead to a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are largely supported by foreign STEM talents. 

2. Most international students extremely hard to be hired with low wage since most local small companies cannot sponsor visa in the future, so it is no way to say international students are stealing local citizens' job. I went to the school job fair. Over 400 companies in the big hall, less than 20 can hire international students, and most of them are huge enterprises. If you are citizens, you should feel lucky because you have 400 companies to choose and we only can fight for 20 companies. How could we take jobs from local citizens. 

Anyway, we strongly support OPT extension. We contribute billions of dollars to US system. If OPT extension has been cancelled, most high-tech projects or companies will be massively affected which also affect US economy! 

To those against this rule, who faked the nameS and kept copying and pasting the same comments such as 
"would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially", we found those fake IDs kept posting same comments.
