I strongly agree that F-1 student should have longer OPT extension. Most US tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, have benefited from hiring international students, they are the foundation of today's burgeoning tech industry, also their international background also broaden their business view. Without the effort from these international students, these tech companies will not growing so fast.

Many people against this rule talked about F-1 students are being lower-payed to get hired, and they blame that's the cause of low hiring rate of US citizen. But it's not true because F-1 students are being payed the same as US citizen, it's actually written in law that companies are not allowed to give lower wage for international students, and the value created by F-1 students is actually greater than the wage they take in most case, hiring international students are beneficial to US economics. And international students do not have any privilege in job market because they are not CITIZEN, most companies will turn down international students because they are not willing to go through the hassle of applying work visa for them. So it's ridiculous to say that international students have taken US citizen's jobs, US citizenship has much more privilege than you think in US job market.

If one has to blame, blame on those consulting companies, they are the companies hiring labors overseas, and sell their work at much lower price than local wage. They are the companies took most of H1B applications and harmful for US economics in the long run. International students who completes degree on the US continent, are different, they only need OPT to work, and their jobs are regular jobs from US companies, not those shady consulting companies. 

Please reconsider the contribution from international students for US economy, and distinguish F-1 students from consulting companies' workers.
