I SUPPORT the extension of OPT proposal for two main reasons:

1. International students are already under great pressure finding a job in US, given the fact that most of the positions require citizenship or being a permanent resident. The native students have great advantage even with longer extension of OPT for the nonnative students. The US would also miss the opportunity to keep more high-end experts in different fields, which is one of the main principles that makes US a strong nation. 

2. Without extension, the time span of OPT is too short even if we assume one has found a job during his/her OPT. He/she would not have enough time to make real contributions and the short period of OPT only give him/her one chance of receiving a H1B working visa, while the successful rate in this "lottery" is lower than years before.
