I strongly support the OPT extension. America is a land of people from different countries around the world. It will be such a shame that a country that attracts all the brains around the world to shut off any support. No one will apply to the United States for studying BS, MS STEM courses if the government plans to screw them after studies. No one wants to spend 65000$ (this is insane money for a guy from india) just to stay for a spring and fall and go back to my country is absoutely useless. I cannot believe that instead of being welcoming to the international students, some amount of local population is being paraniod. Why this fear and frenzy? we already face a lot of problems and do lot of sacrifices to get here and study. Please lets not make more fuss and support granting the extension.
