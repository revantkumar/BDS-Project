I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.

Stem students are rare and precious of human resource, they are technical students that is highly needed by the US companies.

Competioion is not a bad thing
