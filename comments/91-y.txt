US will no longer be super power in terms of technology if they don't expand training opportunities for international students.
US colleges will go in verge of being closed as this discourages all the future aspiring students who want to pursue their dream in US. If we are not provided opportunities we have potential to create our own Microsoft, Google, Apple because if there is brain pool anything is possible. I can just see dark years ahead for US if they reject brains from across the world.
