I strongly Support the proposal for the reasons below.

(1) The proposal is a win-win solution for U.S. employers and F-1 students. In detail, for a company, a well-trained engineer or scientist is an invaluable asset. For F-1 students, the 12-month post-graduation training is just a starting point of the expedition to become an experienced engineer or scientist who learned knowledge from U.S. universities. The new proposal will provide the F-1 students enough learning opportunities to become qualified employees and keep making contributions to the U.S. employers in the meantime. 

(2) The new proposal is also a benefit for the economy. In the proposed rule, it increases the oversight, which minimized the adverse effects to both U.S. workers and the F-1 OPT students. Although competition exists, diversity will flourish the job market. Also, the proposal will ensure the US colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international students and the U.S. education industry will greatly benefit from this new proposal.
