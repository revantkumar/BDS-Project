I don't think the opt-extend program would hurt the job-hunting-opportunity of native Americans. If a native American and an international student with the same working skill sets are chasing the same job, the employer will tend to hire the American candidate. The intense competitions always happen and are happening WITHIN talented international students. Therefore the employee who are not American citizen or permanent residence are really good at their field. The cancellation of the opt-extension only kick talented people out of America without saving the job opportunity of the natives.
