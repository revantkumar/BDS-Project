I strongly support the extension of STEM OPT. 

1.Right now there are thousands of students working for high-tech companies. if the STEM OPT get cancelled they will be forced to go home. that would be a significant losses for all the high-tech companies. Since the high-tech companies make main contributions to the American economics prosperous. cancel the STEM OPT would interrupt the companies daily operatio.

2.the students, who received STEM degree in the US, especially for who have been working in the US for a while, would also bring the latest technology back to their mother countries, if they are forced to go back. in a long term, it might comprise the American competition ability.
