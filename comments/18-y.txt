Hello! I support the improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees. As an international student, this bill will provide me a significantly better chance to contribute my knowledge and skills to the U.S. and the world in general.

The current immigration law, especially the limited distribution of H1-B Visa, prevented a lot of highly-competent international employees to keep working in U.S. My employer of my current part-time job also complains about how he was not able to keep those employees. The improving and Expanding Training Opportunities will alleviate the current situation and let U.S. companies better keep their valuable and outstanding international employees.

The improving and Expanding Training Opportunities will also encourage motivated and outstanding students all over the world to pursue a degree in U.S. Nowadays, the most valuable resource is human. It will serve the U.S. greatly if it can keep attracting competent and brilliant students all over the world.

Some people might fight against it because they believe it will take jobs from American Citizens. I don't think their view is well-supported enough. The only reason someone doesn't get the job is that he/she is not the most eligible person for the role. It makes no sense for the company to favor less competent candidates just because their nationality. It endangers the company in the long run. If someone wants to get a job, just do better with one's work. It is the only right answer.

Thank you for your time to read my comment.
