The United States is a great country build on immigration. The United states prosper because of her open attitudes towards the elites from all over the world. A lot of them came to U.S. as international students. They managed to get accepted by universities because they are elites of the young from their home countries. They come to the country, pay the higher tuition while there is hardly any financial support from scholarships, get educated by the great U.S. institutions. They learned, they survived and they are ready to prosper. 

However, The United States government has no policy trying to make U.S. more appealing than their home country. H1B application is a lottery-like process and there is Cap-Gap on it. This is no like NBA draft. You don't get a H1B because you are good. YOU GET ONE BECAUSE YOU ARE LUCKY. That means thousands of international student who could be the great driven force of US economy are driven back to their home country to make their home country better. How did India and China get competitive in the world? Thousands of US trained students got kicked back! The OPT extension can give them a better chance to stay. That's not stealing jobs from US workers. That is PROTECTING OUR EDUCATION RESOURCES. We don't build these universities to train students for India and China.

Don't blame the international students on the unemployment of US workers. They are not burden of this country. They work hard, pay taxes and contribute a lot to the country. Come on, try a large scope here. More contribution from international students = better economy = more tax revenue = better public health care, welfare, education and more jobs.
