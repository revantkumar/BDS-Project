It's a really great news. If the OPT could be extended in 24 months, for students, they could work harder and do fully services for companies like the other US employers, they don't need to worry about their position like before when the one year OPT would be experienced. For companies, they won't worry about lack of amounts of excellent and talented employers from all over the world. And it's also good for US economics. With the OPT policy could be extended that could attract more talented people overseas, for schools, students, and more things could get benefits.
