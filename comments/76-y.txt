The 24 months OPT extension should be passed as soon as possible, 

a large proportion of STEM students actually get paid for studying in their graduate program, either M.S. or Ph.D, in form of teaching/ researching assistant or fellowship, U.S. government spent huge funding on international students, it is a pity if U.S. only get their research work at school and only 1 year's contribution after they graduate. 

Unlike law, business or other popular area in the U.S., STEM is not so hot in U.S., which means international students are probably the only people who will work in STEM. If the rule cannot get passed, current international students will be forced to leave the country. Potential future students may choose other developed countries including Canada or just stay in their home country, for a better job after graduate, because the U.S. does not welcome them, which help those countries become stronger than US in STEM area in future. The U.S. will lose the advantage in STEM forever by letting international students go.
