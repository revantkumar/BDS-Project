I strongly SUPPORT the proposal

First, the reason why I come here America for my master degree study is it offers me a long enough time for industry training opportunity. And that's the main reason why my friends and I choose to come here despite of high living cost and expensive tuition. For many students like me, one year OPT is not long enough since most companies will not hire a student who can work for them for one year since many projects inside companies lasts one year or longer. And 24 months extension is a good fit. It is long enough for us to be considered by companies and it is not too long since I will go back to my home country eventually after 3 years.

As for the increasing competition in employee market mentioned by some other people. I don't think competition is bad for both employers and employees. Since competition will stimulate people to gain more knowledge, for the companies, they will have more chances to hire more skillful people, and for those hard-working people, they will try to improve their skill in order to get a better job. And that is one of the most important reasons that make America lead in many technologies especially in IT industry.
