I am for the new 24 month OPT extension, because engineering projects usually require a long time to complete, for example, my comany is developing a lab equipment for xray crystallography under a NIH grant, which lasts for 3 years. Also, longer OPT extension will attract more excellent international students to study and work in USA rather than other countries like Canada and UK, it is going to be very helpful to American economy and academy.
