I strongly support the 24 month extension. International students paid much higher tuition than local students they deserve the right to stay here and develop their career. And objectively those talented foreigners have been doing good job to contribute to the development of this country, maybe they even just stayed here and became American. I think this is the spirits of American Dream and that's why Anerica is a great country.
