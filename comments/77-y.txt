Strongly support the proposal. STEM benefits the US in the way that US can keep most talented foreigners in the world to work for the country. It is well recognized that human capital is crucial to the development of the country and thanks to STEM US can accumulate a higher stock of human capital at a much faster rate by recruiting foreigners . Moreover it does not, in any sense, deprive the job opportunities from Americans and I can not see why STEM would give employers the preference over foreigners. People who complain that STEM makes it hard to earn living are those who are not qualified for the jobs at all, and even in the absence of foreign competitors they still can not get those jobs.
