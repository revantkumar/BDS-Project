I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. 
I can see US government is making a terrible decision to send thousands of high skilled foreigners back to their country.
A lot of people are against this proposal, so they can keep their job by sending these people home. They didn't realize that once these foreigners go back, they can help their country creating more job opportunities. As a result, US citizens may loose more opportunities globally. Thus, those people against the proposal are actually ruining our children's job opportunities.
