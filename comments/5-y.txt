I know a lot of brilliant international students who could have made great contribute to the STEM industries in the U.S. but couldn't do so because they cannot get a H1B visa. Because of this, a lot of companies have to open a sub-company in Canada, where job visa are not so competitive, to hire these great engineers. What does this mean? This means U.S. GDP is leaking into Canada! And a lot of smart minds are turned down into other countries! As a country that very much stands on high technology and innovations, this is absolutely not what we want!
If this policy of extending OPT period passes, there will be more opportunities for these international students who can make great contribution to our country. Therefore, please support this policy!
