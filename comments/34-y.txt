I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. American citizens are loosing more and more benefits of being U.S.A. citizens, while various forms of assistance are given to non-citizens living in the U.S.A. The effect of this proposal is to enlarge this problem. Costs for the OPT, of course, come directly out of the the U.S.A. tax-paying citizen's pocket, while at the same time, reducing the citizen's own employment opportunities as jobs are being given to foreign students at sub-standard wages.
