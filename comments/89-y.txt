I support this rule for the reasons as below:

(1)Talent foreign STEM students can bring US more than a job. Sometimes, they can give back US a (NASDAQ)company. Some Americans are complaining about "Foreigners use our job positions." But, as we know, most STEM foreign students have a high education background, like Bachelor / Master /PHD degree. There must be many talent people inside this STEM group. If they can have OPT Extension for 24 months, they will have more opportunity to stay in US, contribute to US. Some of them may think of have their own company in US, too. If a good company can provide 10+ job positions for US people, obviously it is highly deserved. What's more, some talent foreign students may create their business empire - NASDAQ company. Like Yanhong, Li (CEO of BAIDU, INC), he used to study in US for master degree as a foreign student, now his company BAIDU has market value 68 Billion in NASDAQ, which makes a big contribute to US economy.

(2)American spirit is to give everyone equal chance. As we know, US is an immigration country, the immigrant from almost everywhere of the world work together to create this richest country. This is American culture. We should support OPT Extension Rule to give foreign student a stage to show their talent and let them contribute to US.
