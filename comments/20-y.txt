I strongly support the proposal to improve and expand OPT program. International students all come here with high education, most of them have bachelor, master or even doctorate degree. The growth of techonogly and economy needs skilled and educated talents, international students are of course the good human resource. International students came here NOT to fight with US citizens, but to work with US citizens and to creat more job opportunities.
