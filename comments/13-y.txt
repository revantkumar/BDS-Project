As the number of opt students increased significantly since last year, the chance of being blue to get pulled out from this pool is less as an international student. I sponsored 2 of them last year and none got in, as an employer for a small business it's hard to compete with the mega tech companies for the limited seats. It would really help us small businesses in hinging and keeping the people we need with this action.
