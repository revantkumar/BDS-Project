OPT extension is the right thing to do! I'm a PhD student in F-1 status. I believe I'm well-trained and have certain expertise in my field. However, people like me still have to go through normal H1-B lottery and suffer from possibilities of failing to get H1-B. I believe America needs talented people to build its economy. Extending OPT gives us better chance to get H1-B and create more value to the state. I strongly support OPT extension!
