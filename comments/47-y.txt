When I was applying for graduate school, I got offers from the UK, Singapore and the US. They all offered very attractive scholarships. One important reason that I came to the US was the large number of much better developed industries compared to other countries and the perspective of gaining practical training experiences in those industries after I get my degree. It would be very disappointing for current and future perspective international students if the OPT is only limited to one year. 

I am in an interdisciplinary area (computational biology). All the projects I was involved during my Ph.D. requires substantially more than one year to complete. One student in our lab took four years to carefully investigate the various factors that are involved in making reasonable predictions of a biological process. Lots of my friends in other experimental sciences needs even more time, because of the time consuming steps of generating hypothesis, experimentally validating them and making sure that they are reproducible. 

Many of us take positions in high-tech R&D in pharmaceutical industries after graduation. The process of developing effective new drugs is impossible within a couple years' time frame. 

The two-year extension is absolutely necessary for fresh graduates to gain meaningful experience in my field. Now that I am about to graduate, it is disappointing and discouraging to see this policy cancelled. I would strongly encourage my friends at home to reconsider their decision on studying in the US if this extension was not reinstated.
