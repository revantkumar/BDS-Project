I totally support the new proposal.

As a Ph.D students in Economics, Let me explain why this extension is important for the US.

1. One of the biggest attraction for foreign students to come to US universities is the OPT opportunity. They are paying 50 thousand per year, while most American students only pay 10 thousand per year. Their contribution in tuition is a big input for the universities to keep operating. 

2. In large technology companies, these foreign students are highly valued, they filled the lack of outstanding programmers and engineers, because typically American students will not like to choose related majors.

3. They are paying taxes and will not be likely to be an official US citizen. They are likely to leave after OPT ends because the H1B is restricted. 

Conclusion: this extension will definitely benefit US economy.
