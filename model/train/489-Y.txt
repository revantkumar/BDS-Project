This proposal must be highly supported, not only for educational institutes, but also for the economy development of the USA. 

Education for internal students provided by US schools takes an important role in US economy. If OPT for STEM degrees can be expanded, there will be more and more international students coming here for study in the future. This will help the US schools develop and also provides more job opportunities in this area. 

Meanwhile, it is good to US economy, because those students with STEM degrees can stay two more years here, work for the US organizations with low payment. For those students, they obtain experiences, while for the us companies, they gain a lot more from those students. 

Overall, I highly support this proposal.
