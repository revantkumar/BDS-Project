A widely spread scenario to anti immigrant is that a low salary needed foreigner will attract more interest and take the job which should belong to a same skilled US citizen. However, it is not true. Or it is not true in STEM area. Jobs related with STEM can be easily quantify it's required skill and size of demanding. So the reason why so many high-tech company need more foreigners to fill the lack is because there still exists so much lack of labors even they have hired all qualified US citizens. God bless american, so many foreigner who graduated and educated by american's universities can filled that labor shortage. 

This policy is definitely good to american by all aspects. They empower the high tech industry then crate more jobs, which native born americans actually benefits the most. Then they fill the labor shortage which make american's industry not facing the worry of labor shortage. Third, those students are educated in american's universities. They received great education in american, after they graduate, all countries will welcome those highly skilled labor into their countries. If they can stay in US, US will benefited and other countries will not be able to take advantage of american's great education, vice versa. 

Someone might ask why native born american can not be educated until they can fill that shortage. The answer is simple, it needs time. In the near several years, those areas need more worker than the increasing qualified american workers. That is why OPT exists and why DHS raised the first OPT extension several years ago. 

Therefore, I'm strongly support this new policy.
