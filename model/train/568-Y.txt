I thinks this extension is going to benefit US a lot including more educated international students staying here contribute to the innovative work, accelerate the diversification of the society, bridge the human resources from other countries to US, etc. 
On the contrary, if this is not going to be the case, all big banks, high tech companies are going to lose the creative emplyees, and these people might go to other countries and then make US not a competitive country for IT, finance and other industries.
