I strongly support the proposal:

1, the international student contribute tremendously to both the workforce and the economy, they not only create value for the company but also has good consuming power that eventfully benefits the economy.

2, They are the best of the student group from their own country, if U.S is not able to attract them and make them stay, they are going to return to their home country and compete with the U.S. companies, do you rather wanna those intelligent people to for for you or compete with you? 

Best,
Wendy
