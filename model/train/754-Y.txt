I fully support the new proposal that expanding the amount of time a foreign STEM student can work in the U.S. on a student visa. I have Ph.D in Pharmaceutical Science, and currently work for a big pharmaceutical company. The new proposal will enable me and other junior scientists to have three years in total to have the freedom to focus only on science for drug development, and evaluate our career in the health science. Kindly do not take away that opportunity from us. I would sincerely appreciate your favorable considerations on this proposal.
