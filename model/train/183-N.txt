I oppose DHS proposal to expand the OPT program because it takes jobs away from U.S. citizens. It also drains money from the Social Security retirement and Medicare programs trust fund. It has deviated from its original intent to provide technical expertise to foreign countries by the returning students. Many of these now educated graduates are now staying in the U.S. and are being hired by companies who want cheaper labor. This program disadvantages the U.S. citizen.
