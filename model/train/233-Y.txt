I strongly agree with the proposed rule for the following reasons:

1. Foreign talents did so many contributions to this country, without them, US will not be such a strong country. With these talents, more researches can be done in universities, more high tech companies can be founded. After all, talents is the key for a country to be great. It is not wise for a country to block talents.
2. Bring more foreign talents will not cause Americans to lose their job. The industries in STEM fields are growing rapidly, more and more talent engineers will be needed. Only Americans cannot satisfy such high demand. 
3. On the contrary, foreign students in STEM fields can create lots of job opportunities for Americans. They may start their own company and create more jobs, or they at least they will pay the tuition, rent apartments, eat, travel, do shopping, watch movies, these will all benefit the US economy.
