Our people need jobs. I don't think it is very patriotic, or economically wise, to bring foreign workers in to do jobs when Americans are struggling. The money companies may save by paying lower wages will be more than offset by the lose of spending power and financial independence of displaced or unemployed Americans. From a purely economic viewpoint, these people still need to eat and educate their children and go to the doctor. Someone has to pay for this and if they don't have decent jobs, guess who gets to pay for it.
From a social and moral standpoint, if you've never lost a job to someone younger and/or cheaper, just imagine what it feels like. I'm sure I don't even have to go any further.
