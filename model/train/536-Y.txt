I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 

I'm an international student from China and major in computer science. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my degree all over the world. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM students. What is more, U.S. employers, like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, will definitely benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students. 

So, again, I strongly hope this new OPT extension rule will pass soon!
