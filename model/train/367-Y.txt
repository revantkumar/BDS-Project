Dear all,

I strongly agree on the new STEM Extension rule. First of all, American high tech companies heavily rely on smart, highly-educated people who are Americans and foreigners. These people are dedicated to bring benefits to US economy. STEM F-1 students will not affect general unemployment rate because they are completing with highly-educated and brilliant Americans. If getting rid of these F-1 students, many less smart Americans will work for high tech companies, which will potentially do harm to American economy. You can't sacrifice future economy to decrease temporary unemployment rate. Needless to say the number of STEM F-1 students is very very small and STEM F-1 students are top people in the society. 

Secondly, this competition can greatly help Americans improve and learn from it. Moreover, US cannot lose these talent foreign people to make contributions to US. Because they are brilliant enough, if they go back to their home countries, US high tech companies cannot be top companies in the world. In a word, these STEM F-1 students are helping America and America economy.

Thanks!

Kevin
