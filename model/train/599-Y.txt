As a Chinese student, it's so lucky for me to come here and study many developed technologies in USA. The OPT also offers me a practical way to gain more experience in both professional and social networking field.
And with China building amicable relationship now with America, it's good to bring culture and ideas from China to America, which will help create more economic opportunities in both these countries.
What's more, STEM industry in America is playing an irreplaceable role in America's overall economy. Therefore, having STEM students to stay longer in America is a win-win solution for both America and those students. The students can get the most valued experience, and America can get the smartest student to work and help develop the economy.
