There is no doubt science and technology have been and will continue to be the leading factor in economic development of any country nowadays. As we climb on the slope of the information age, machines are taking over laborious tasks and the key to massive added value is human intelligence. STEM graduates are competitive scientists coming from all corners of the world to the U.S. with a shared dream: advance their profession to the top of the field, and contribute their best to the nation. Retaining such intellectual capacity is, by no doubt, in the interest of the U.S. as well as any country who wants the leading role in the information age.
