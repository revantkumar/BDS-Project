It is good news for students, universities and industry. This should be supported : )

Industrial experience is important and valuable for STEM students. As a current STEM students, I chose USA three years ago because OPT policy as it provides excellent opportunity for students to get better understanding of what they learned in the university.

Now U.S. universities have an increasing number of international students, of them most are majored in STEM. The new extension rule would definitely improve the quality of education as industrial practice is the best follow up for university knowledge. In return, U.S. will then keep attracting excellent international students so that making higher education program the best in this earth.

Third, during the extension of international students practical training, they contribute the diversity, they contribute the high technology, contribute the economy and contribute the growth of local businesses and a lot. All these benefits are built on this good news, which is great!
