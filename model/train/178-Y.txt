I strongly support this rule as it would benefit the students to gain valuable experience and getting exposed to the latest technologies and helps students to improve skills rapidly with a good learning curve. In fact I myself have experienced this as I worked back in my country for over 3 years for a leading IT company in US, but the experience I gained here in US within 6 months during my OPT was very much useful as its totally different when compared to that of my previous work experience where the Managers and Leads here are very much experienced and talented who helps us in good decision making.

At the same time I would like DHS and USCIS to make sure that they strictly follow the rules for OPT while extending OPT or while issuing H1B where some of the students who are pursuing Masters/Bachelors in Mechanical or Electrical Engineering fields are trying to enter into IT and Software Programming related fields which I think is not at all related to their fields and not sure how the employers are recruiting them who have a degree in another field. DHS should investigate this and also publish new rules stating that OPT would be cancelled or H1 visa would not be granted to students who work in unrelated areas.

I also would like DHS and USCIS to look into another issue where some of the students who are filing H1B visas apply with multiple employers or consultancies by paying H1B visa fees as they are incompetent which would lessen the chances for other students who are sincerely working hard and are much more talented than those people who are filing multiple H1B visas, hence the one who has much more talent and creative in mind who would help United States to create new job opportunities would be forced to leave the country as the H1B visa lottery is more and more competitive and lessens the chances of such people.

Finally I would like to say that expanding OPT time is a very good idea and helps thousands of students who pursue their Masters to gain valuable experience which cannot happen else where and help students to come up with creative ideas which would help create new job opportunities so I strongly support this idea and DHS/USCIS should rectify the issues with students working in non related areas to their area of study and they should investigate if its really related or not, and also publish strict rules against multiple filing of H1B visas even with multiple employers are the chances for other students would be reduced and a student who is really good may end up leaving the country.
