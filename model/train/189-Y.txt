I have read many of those comments from our US citizens, and I am very surprised many of us lack the vision of the future. They ordinarily think that by cutting the OPT STEM, our US STEM workers can benefit from that. I would argue against that, and to me, those comments apparently do not see what is coming for.

I have quite some experience working in pharmaceutical industry, and I have seen a trend of US big pharma moving out of US, due to a lack of excellent scientists and engineers in the country. Instead, they move their R&D departments to other places, such as Germany, UK, Ireland, China and Singapore, just because those places have the good workers and their local government warmly welcome that.

Now look at what we got here in the US, we know consistently that our country need MUCH MORE scientists and other tech people, and we are reluctant to take advantage of the many fresh graduates we educate, who will return to their homeland country, and who will be super competitors against us in the near future. 

My question is, do we really want that to happen? Are we so intimidated and not brave enough to fit in the new trend for the globe? Think about it.
