Why are illegal aliens taking American jobs when there are 93 million unemployed, under employed American workers? Why are H1B VISAS being used for foreign workers when our own college STEM graduates can't find jobs?? Obama been bought off by Mark Zuckerberg for cheap labor?? The billionaire just doesn't have enough cheap labor?
