I have just learned that Optional Practical Training Program (OPT) removed jobs from 430,000 Americans between 2009-2013
and that OPT kept $4 billion from SSI pool of funds.

As an Electronic Engineer, I oppose this program, and its extension.

also:
as Sen. Grassley said
"the proposed regulations are "irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it."

"OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans."

I don't understand how this administration can claim there are not enough STEM students, and then offer STEM training to foreign students. Why are similar mentoring programs not open to US citizens?

Why is it ok for DHS to define a recent college grad as a student, for the purpose of F1 visas?

As an Eletronic Engineer, I have to agree with Mr. Hira.

Ron Hira of Howard University says "It's an over-reach to claim that someone who completes a master's degree in as little as 12 months needs three years interning -- at low or no pay in many cases -- to get further training."

How is it possible that the Regulations would not restrict the definition of prevailing wages to the locality of the business but, instead, would open such definitions to the world by providing the Department of Labors Office of Foreign Labor Certification?
