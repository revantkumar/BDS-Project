From my perspective, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal that the government should improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1students, for the following reasons:
1.Diversity,which is very important for the U.S., can in fact promote development of human-beings, improving birth-quality, creating job opportunities.
2.AS to the job opportunities, it is irrational to say that people from other countries will occupy the job opportunities for the local people. On the contrary, students with STEM degrees are usually ones of the most outstanding elites in their own countries. So those students will undoubtedly contribute to increasing job opportunities with their knowledge, which is BETTER for the local citizens.
