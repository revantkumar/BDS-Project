I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. have opportunities to make contributions to U.S. companies. So that the education investments of U.S. can have a better reward.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. International students, as a part of industry, have always been making great contributions to the prosperity of the industry.
