The current employment reality in the U.S. has our CITIZEN STEM students graduating from college into a situation where there are only half as many STEM jobs available as there are CITIZEN STEM graduates. 

How is it not TREASON for the federal government to create policies that multiply the number of foreign STEM graduates and then allow the foreign graduates additional time in the U.S. to compete/displace our CITIZEN STEM graduates in the few STEM jobs that are available????? How is that not treason??

When government policies deliberately undermine the ability of U.S. citizens to find work in their chosen fields and intentionally allows FOREIGN nationals to replace them, HOW IS THAT NOT TREASON??
