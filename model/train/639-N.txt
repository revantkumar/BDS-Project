Last year, the Center for Immigration Studies submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to learn more about the OPT program and its impact on American workers. CIS confirmed that:
497,274 work authorizations were granted through OPT between 2009 and 2015
Both the workers and their employers are exempt from payroll taxes, costing the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds $4 billion
Additionally, employers are not required to pay OPT workers the prevailing wage, meaning they can hire OPT workers for lower wages than American workers who would perform the same tasks.
The OPT program was also designed to allow foreign students to gain work experience in their field of study that would help them find work when they return to their home countries. But instead, the proposed extension for tech workers would, in effect, create a bridge to an H-1B tech-worker visa and eventual employment-based green cards.
Simply put, the OPT program is an easy way for tech companies to recruit cheaper foreign workers at the expense of American workers and STEM students. 
I AM VERY MUCH AGAINST THIS RULE. IN FACT I JUST LOST MY JOB AT ONE OF THE KRAFTGEINZ FOOD PLANTS THAT WILL BE SHUT DOWN!!!! THIS RULE WILL DO NOTHING MORE THAN TAKE MORE JOBS FROM AMERICANWORKERS!!!!!
