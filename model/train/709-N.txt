why are you so concerned about foreign workers and getting them work with unemployment so high in America our people need to work first then worry about foreign workers they say the unemployment rate in America is about 5.5 percent that's bogus numbers its more like 21/22 percent and you know it, bad enough you got illegal immigrants scamming the system and get away with it nothing gets done about it but you want to give jobs to foreign workers. American citizens come first you should know that.
