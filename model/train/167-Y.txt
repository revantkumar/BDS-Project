As an Engineering Manager in a large corporation with global footprint, I work with highly skilled foreign nationals in the field of Engineering on a daily basis. Some of them work on STEM OPT extensions when they start their career, providing and proving significant technical input to improve our products and competitiveness in a globalized economy.

Sponsoring a more long-term VISA to continue their employment and the associated benefit is a time-consuming process from the employer's point of view. Therefore, without STEM OPT extension, there is a high risk of losing the support from these individuals. Filling open positions with well-trained and ambitious engineers is challenging already and losing STEM OPT employees would make the situation worse.

That is why I strongly support the proposed new rule to allow 24-month STEM OPT extensions.
