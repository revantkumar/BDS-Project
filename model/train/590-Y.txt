I totally support this new rule based on my own experience with STEM OPT. I graduated in 2013 and was plannning to apply for the initial OPT, which is 12 months. I noticed at that time that if I had let my OPT started from May 2013 like almost every classmate of mine did, with the STEM OPT extension I could be on a valid OPT (&STEM OPT) only till Oct 2015. That would have allowed me two chances - April 2014 & April 2015 - to apply for Industrial H1b. At that time that my Ph.D. supervisor was gonna to keep me as a post-doc in the lab for another two years for the sake of helping him train new students and explore new research projects. So I knew I was going to miss the first two chances for H1b application. With all the considerations, I had to delay my graduation till end of 2013, so that my initial OPT started from Nov 2013 and thus my STEM OPT would cover a third chance in April 2016. I am currently working in a company so I am waiting for the industrial H1b lottory in April 2016. Should we have the new rule of 24-month STEM OPT, I wouldn't have to delay my graduation date to end of 2013, which made some differences for me as I was then grouped into the graduate class of 2014 instead of 2013. With my personal case here, I sincerely hope this situation does not necessarily happen to another foreign student any more.
