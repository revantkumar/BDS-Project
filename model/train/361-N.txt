Our elected representatives have and continue to be dispicable and a total disgrace to every living veteran and those interned in our national commentaries who have protected their right to disgrace them. These veterans, especially those of Foreign Wars who have sacrificed so much, believed in our Constitution and flag and put their trust in elected representatives like you to protect them from fiscal corruption, from foreign invasion which violates the sovereignty of our nations borders, economic security and opportunities, government deceit, bureaucratic corruption, disregard for the rule of law, desecration of our constitution, and promotion of a socialist party rhetoric that is intent on destroying our country. Party rhetorics that our elected representatives have historically and seem to continue to so enthusiastically participate in and promote and implementing with a very sick administration. What has this country ever did to these ungrateful elected representatives and bureaucrats that would constitute them to continually to place the interests of We the People second to the personal and unjustified vendettas of some elected and non elected representatives and not protect the honest law abiding taxpayers of this nation from obtaining economical opportunities or protecting our nations sovereignty? Those that do not put the honest law abiding taxpayers rights ahead of their own vendettas have forgotten the following.

Federal Oath of Office.

I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.
