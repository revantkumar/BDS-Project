The OPT program is a complete betrayal of the American people by this administration. This proposed expansion will ensure that our kids will never be able to find a job again. In a time where college tuition has become unaffordable and our kids are drowned in student load debt, we are importing hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals to compete for the few available jobs in STEM. 
What is amazing to me is that foreign nationals are able to comment on this board in favor of policies that favors them at the expense of American citizens. It seems that this administration is more concerned about the well-being of everyone except the citizens of the country that elected them. I guess, that after our politicians received so much campaign donations from Silicon Valley, they have to find a way to pay their big donors by increasing foreign worker visas.
I have a PhD in a biotechnology related field from Cornell University and a postdoctoral degree from MIT and the job market for me and my colleges has been horrible. If there is a shortage of STEM workers, how come people with degrees from top universities are not finding jobs? If there is a need for H1b visas and OPT visas, why are companies so eager to lay off so many workers? I would guess that companies would be hesitant to loose talented people if they thought that they could not find replacements. Iven in saturated markets like chemistry and biotech, companies are using lots of h1b and OPT visas.
Could the use of H1b and OPT visas discourage companies from hiring capable and qualified people that may just need some training? Is it possible that by flooding the market, our government is taking leverage form the workers and giving all the power to corporations?
