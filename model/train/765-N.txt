Even though I all ready have a 2 yr technical degree I am unable to find a job in my field. I know there are many people just like me in the same predicament. More foreign workers are the last thing America needs! Especially when they work for a fraction of the prevailing wage! It's bad enough to see so many jobs leaving our country but to import foreign workers is a slap in the face of hard working Americans like myself!
