I support the new proposed OPT rules!
The new proposed OPT rules can help international students get better training after they graduated from college. The training can improve the quality of education of the university in US, which will attract more and more international students to apply the university in US. And more international students can definitely build better economic environments for the university and ease the burden of government, especially for the public universities. The only reason that international students want to attend university in US is the best education quality of the education across the world. And the OPT is one of the most important parts to make the education quality better.

Another important reason why I support the new OPT rules is that international students are not only help building better universities but also making contributions to US companies. There're tens of thousands of international students who is working for US companies after they graduated( thanks the old opt rules). These people are smartest people on the earth, most of them are masters and PhD graduated from worlds best universities. They're making huge contributions to US companies, economics and technologies. Some of them are working at worlds best companies like Google, FB. They also pay a huge amount of tax every year. Without these harding working people, companies like google cannot be the leading companies in the world; low-income and unemployed people cannot live a good quality life like now; US cannot be the worlds greatest country in the world!

Based on the above options, I hereby support the DHS proposed OPT Rules
