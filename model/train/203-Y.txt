I'm an international student from China. I currently study at Carnegie Mellon University. I strongly agree this proposed rule. OPT for nonimmigrant students will give us a chance to sharpen our classroom learning skills and apply them in companies. It is definitely a good way to attract more international students and tuitions they pay is always good to US economy.

I saw some comments saying that Americans should be hired ahead of foreign students. This is true, but has nothing to do with this proposed rule. Let's take a look of the CS and ECE departments of the top 20 universities. The majority of the students and most of the top students comes from the under developed countries like China and India. So is the math/physics department. This means STEM students will never be a threat to US citizens in job hunting.
