This rule is definitely important and necessary to the economy of United States. Foreign STEM students are highly talented, just like all other US citizens, they pay FICA taxes, contribute to the sales of local grocery stores. A lot of U.S. companies that hired STEM students on OPT find that STEM students do an excellent job for the employer, in order to retain these talented employees, employers have to petition H1B visas for them. Due to the annual H1B cap, lots of these talented employees cannot get visa thus have to leave America - as well as the company, this definitely will create a huge financial loss to the companies who hire them - and ultimately, hurt the U.S. economy, with STEM extension, students that already have a job will have additional opportunities to secure an H1B visa, even they ultimately cannot stay in the U.S., the company and U.S. economy can benefit from their contribution.

Although I support the overall STEM Extension rule proposed by DHS, I don't think the mentoring and training program is necessary. As STEM students are mostly employed as regular employees in the company, they are working in their fields as all other regular U.S. workers, it will be an unnecessary burden for companies to create such mentoring and training program, it may, however, also jeopardize their opportunity in the company.
