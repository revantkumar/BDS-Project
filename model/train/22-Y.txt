Dear USCIS,

Thanks for your efforts in bringing relief and smile to F1 Nonimmigrants who invested their significant savings in STEM related courses in USA. It's great work.

Thanks a lot to USCIS and our President Mr. Barack Obama. I'm not a beneficiary to this action but such action has to be appreciated. Keep it up.
