The American Educational System is a leader in the global educational environment due to the fact that it is highly practical. While the classroom is very imperative to this practical teaching, it is still limited- as it is limited by its ONLY informative process. For this reason, a real life experience is pertinent. So OPT suffice in this regards. This is the reason many international students prefer the United states over other countries. As a student of Information systems, and into systems analysis and design, I have come to the realization that no effective system is built and implemented within a year. Upon graduation, an employer would prefer to have employee who can follow a project from start to end- in which case one year is not enough. Transfer of personnel has shown to affected IT systems design because of historical effect of most SDLC process. It leads to more cost of project implementation. In order to address this, I think the STEM OPT is imperative because it gives the "Prospective" student reason to come here to study. It also gives the graduate of STEM- who need more time- the opportunity to develop a complete training (classroom & real life). It gives Employers safe heaven and assurance of not training two staff for one role in a project which increases profit to the employer and in turn the economy. Finally, it causes an increase- or at least prevent decrease- in enrollment of international students in American schools who contribute to the school's income more than indigenous students.
