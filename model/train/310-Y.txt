It's a little irony that our program just became a part of STEM at the beginning of this year, months later, the extension for STEM degree was endangered.

The MA program I'm in is called General Psychology, which includes multiple tracks. Take clinical track as an example, we nonimmigrant students may plan to pursue a PhD program or find a job. For those who want to become doctors, research experience can definitely increase their competitiveness. But two years here is far from enough because we have to take courses at the same time. So many of us chose to work as a research assistant in the labs they are interested in, and it's very common for psychologists to spend 2 to 3 years to have one project done. 

As for other students, like me, who decide to go back to our countries and serve our people eventually, we hope to practice what we've learned here so that we will be able to make the most of the degree we get, which makes the 2-year-long extension very valuable to us. Meanwhile, we, as consumers, as students and as future interns, are making contribution to this country's economy, and the extension will surely improve this win-win situation.

I believe nonimmigrant students can benefit a lot from this rule and I genuinely wish it can get passed.
