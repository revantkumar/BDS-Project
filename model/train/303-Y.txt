As an international student, I know how difficult it is to find a job in US. Only the best ones can get hired. There is no way that foreign workers replace any US citizens. The foreign STEM workers are not cheaper. Instead, the cost to hire a foreign worker is higher. The salaries are similar. In the meantime, the companies need to pay the cost to prepare paper works like OPT or H1B.They also take the risk that foreign workers have to leave due to visa problems right after the companies train the foreign workers. We all know that employees are more productive when they have two or three years experience. After all these costs, there are still a few companies hire foreign workers, most of which are high-tech companies. That's because the companies need us. If there is no extension of OPT program, only one year is not enough to train a STEM worker well. The companies will find other ways to fill the blank. Maybe move overseas where they can legally hire foreign STEM workers. At that time, the US economy will hurt, just like the automobile industry. Only focusing on immediate interests will hurt everyone!
