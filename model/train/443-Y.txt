The extension of OPT program fuels US economy with more skilled and qualified manpower in STEM fields, which has a much lower unemployment rate than general work force (data from NSF http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/NSFTable-large.jpg)

Foreign students pay tuition that is usually twice as much as American citizens do (taking Purdue as an example http://www.admissions.purdue.edu/costsandfinaid/tuitionfees.php) . Extra earnings obtained by American universities from foreign student are used to benefit every college student, foreign or native, equally. While American students have unlimited time to identify career opportunities and unlimited access to jobs (no objections here, totally respect citizen's rights), foreign students are faced with a three-month period to seek employment and limited access to career opportunities due to visa status and limited networking (more than half of companies listed in my university's job portal do not sponsor work visas thus do not offer employment to OPT students).

The OPT students who successfully find employment within the three-month deadline through fair competition among all candidates, foreign or native, are proven to be competitive and skillful, and should be granted the opportunity and time to further develop working experience. Their skill sets will continue to benefit the business of their employer with a longer OPT period.

As a result, I fully support OPT extension. I believe it is beneficial to the foreign students in STEM fields as well as the STEM fields development in US.
