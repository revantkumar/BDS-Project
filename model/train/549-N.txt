Homeland Security's proposal to expand the Optional Training Program (OPT) giving employers financial incentives (bribes) to hire foreign students or graduates over American students is unAmerican, ludicrous, and just wrong in so many ways. If anybody should get these benefits it should be American citizens. America should not be giving any benefits to foreigners. Not money, nor to be given preference to attend school ahead or instead of American citizens, nor for jobs. 
What is wrong with those who are pushing such anti American scams?
America and Americans should be placed first in everything. Patriotic Americans want Americans to excel not foreigners. Americans will refuse to pay to subsidize foreigners so they can take away American jobs.
Why would any real American not put America and American citizens first? 
Obviously America needs to show many more politicians and some of those who manage various Departments like DHS to the unemployment line.
