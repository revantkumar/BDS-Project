OPT extension is an very important, or even essential if I say, part of education in US university for international students.
The tuition from international students constitutes an important part of incoming for US universities. In fact, in many universities, the stipends for PhD students come nearly from the tuition of undergraduate and master students. OPT and OPT extension in here are great attraction of US educational system over European and Asian system, as this grace period is indispensable for international students to find a job better than in their homeland. Therefore, without OPT extension, US educational system is giving up its advantages to Europe and Asia.
On the other hand, these international students are not competing with native US students in job market directly. Most of the international students work in the field of computer science in silicon valley, where the unemployment rate is 0%. Therefore, if the US students are willing to work in the field of computer science, they will always find a job; if not, then they are not competing with international students.
