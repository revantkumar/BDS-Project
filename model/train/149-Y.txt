I strongly support to extension of stem OPT. For the behalf of US, it is beneficial and valuable. On the behalf of politics, although US is the most powerful country in the world, it depends on other countries. So if government doesn't give international students, these excellent minds are going back to their country and make their country powerful. Thus should pass this proposal.
