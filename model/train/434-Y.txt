The rule now made is better for public. Many students would have been affected
if it was just 12 months . Now even students who want to come abroad to pursue 
Masters have no worries. They can plan for it. We can work productively for more days
and learn better . Even upcoming students won't be worried. This decision won't 
be a barrier for them to stop them from growing and gaining knowledge coming to USA.
