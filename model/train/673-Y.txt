The competition to keep well-educated people is always an important strategy for any country. In the United States is especially true for certain areas, mainly those included in the STEM programs. By allowing STEM extension, the needs for high-tech companies will be supplied better and make those companies more competitive in world stage. As a result, I strongly support the extension of STEM programs.
