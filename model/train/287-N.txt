I am a parent whom has just spent $ several $ 100,000's on college education. I'm not the only parent that has done this nor will I be the last. But after my family has fought in many wars to protect America and then these corporation put foreigners before Americans for jobs is unpatriotic and anti-American. These corporations started and got early revenues by Americans now want to screw these same American families & citizens. Enough is enough, your bank accounts are big enough time for you to help Americans FIRST and not foreigners as we are very good to the rest of the world and everyone now wants to eat at America's trough!
This like all the massive immigration our country has experienced the past 25 years is destroying American families and thus America!!!
The corporations need to take care and make all necessary arrangements to hire Americans first and stop with this constant foreigner worker import. I will personally stop buying products from these companies deemed anti-American by hiring foreigners.
