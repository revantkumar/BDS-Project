Why are we providing incentives to take jobs from American?

Here's a fact:
A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

So this proposal will further deny American workers who are already struggling against the competition from illegal immigration and the influx of Middle Eastern refugees.

Removing funds from Social Security and Medicare denies future benefits of current and future citizens.

Bad Idea all round.
