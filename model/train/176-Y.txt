OPT STEM extension has to be extended from 17 months to 24 or more months. Which will benefit both Us economy and as well as students from abroad. This is very good system if stem extension is cancelled it will affect all university's international student's admission for Masters degree , also the corporate world and America will miss many resources. Having stem extension for 24 months would be the wise and good choice for America.
