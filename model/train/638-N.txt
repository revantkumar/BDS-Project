I believe this regulation will decrease the amount of jobs available for American tech workers. This is proven when companies such as Disney fire their American workers and hire all foreign workers. These workers are not smarter as corporations and government would have us believe, they simply work for less.

There should be no rewards for hiring foreign workers over American workers, financial or otherwise. The playing field should be level.

You want to expand a program that in the past:
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.(Center for Immigration Studies)

OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. Not only do companies discriminate against American workers for lower paid foreign workers, it also cost American workers for the Social Security costs. 

Again, there should be no special benefits or incentives offered for hiring foreign workers! I urge you to reconsider the expansion of this program and to instead, consider ending it.
