I support the new policy of increasing OPT extension and expanding training opportunities.

Over the decades, the most important lesson we know is that it is due to the diversity and openness that the USA keep its top position in the world. 

Firstly, this policy will help keep American economy vibrant because many STEM F1 students dedicate a lot to the economic growth.

When the economy gets better and better, it will ultimately benefit American citizens and society. Many F1 Stem students can create profit for the society and add refreshing element into the market. It is also well known that many companies in the high tech field rely on talented international students in a great degree.

I agree with what the policy is intended to achieve and hope it will be passed as soon as possible.
