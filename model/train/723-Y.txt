I strongly agree with this new rule. One important reason mentioned for people to oppose is that foreign students will take away the opportunities of Americans. I deeply doubt about this. Most foreign students are the most excellent part of the students in their mother counties. If they work for American company or they do startup. They are a important part of who make the American economy better. And if economy is better and there are more promising companies, the opportunities for Americans are actually more rather than less. If the case is in reverse, all of these excellent students come back to there mother countries. They will use their intelligence and the knowledge learned from US to work better for the companies in their companies or even open companies to compete with American companies. At that time, American companies will have strong competitors and at the same time have the possibilities that they cannot hire enough smart and experienced employees to compete with international companies. It is not hard to think about the result.

Another important reason to support this rule is the spirit the rule represents. One very important reason for the US to be the most powerful country in this globe is that US has the best regulation in the world and the spirit to endure people from different countries, culture. Everyone can pursue their American dream as long as they are willing to make effort. A lot of American companies' founders or leaders are immigrants or descents of immigrants like Elon Musk or Pierre Omidyar, etc. And foreign students are part of them. This makes this country so attractive and people from different parts of world want to come to this country and contribute to it. If one day, no one wants to come or immigrant to the US, will she still be the most powerful country in the world? Can you imagine that?

So this rule will make America better in many ways.
