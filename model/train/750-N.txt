Please reconsider this rule. This will do more harm to the American economy and the future of our college graduates than anything else and definitely would have implications on the non immigrant students in the long run. More importantly, American college graduates today are not able to secure better paying jobs but we are going to now assist in promoting hiring foreign college graduates over our own and completely ensure our future as a world leader is going to quickly be a memory.
