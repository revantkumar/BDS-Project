Yes I fully support extending the OPT to 24 months as this gives the foreign students good exposure and an opportunity to exercise their knowledge. This will not only help the students but also the nation as a whole as we are talking about highly qualified students from Universities who increase the competitiveness of general skill pool in the country. I also hope that, DHS not only extends the STEM OPT but also proposes a separate JOB VISA category for foreign students who study in the US (away from H1B) as I believe that they just increase the competition and quality of workforce in the country.
