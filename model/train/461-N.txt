I am against the expansion or the increase of time given to students studying in this country that are not citizens, because 
this is being used to bypass the time already preset for them to stay in this country. This is a clear step to bypass what 
should be an illegal immigration process. We have a large number of workers in this country looking for work, how about
these workers? I believe there is a good chance that there is a big tax benefit for industry to bypass our citizens, and use
these workers. I believe this policy is a large crack in our immigration policy, and part of the reason it's not working like it
used to.
