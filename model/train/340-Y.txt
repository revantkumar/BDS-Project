I support the STEM extension to be increased to 24-months after a 12 month period.
This is essential for bright and capable students to gain relevant work experience in the STEM fields after completion of a advanced degree from United States.

This will ensure the attractiveness of the Universities here and allow students to legally work in USA without any limitations.

Thus, 24-month extension in my opinion is great and should be passed.
