It is really interesting that you have highlighted many things which would benefit the US citizens. But, I being a foreign international student also have an answer for you that we are not grabbing any US citizen jobs. If I look for 100 jobs to apply, out of them I find more than 70 specifying the rule that "we cannot sponsor H1 visas, we are looking for a US citizen".

Even if the employers are open for sponsorship, they are first looking for ways to avoid sponsorship by recruiting US citizens if their skills match. Most obvious thing - If an international student and a US citizen file a job application with similar skills, the US citizen will be given priority. So there is no point of worrying about the jobs here. More over the international students are looking fro jobs in STEM field and there are plenty other fields where US citizens can look for jobs. 

Also we are paying too much tuition fees as well. If only three universities provide funding to international students, it doesn't mean that everyone is getting free education here. I hope the revenue we generate in the form of fees is much higher than the amount US government spend on making this rule.
