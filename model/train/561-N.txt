This program will increase the illegal head count in the United States as already many students here on student VISA simply drop out of school after arriving and go under the radar. I know a number, having received their SS number as a student, dropped out out of school and are now working legally here, many as truck drivers, driving big rigs across the US even though they did not drive anything before arriving. Its scary!
