Our American workers need jobs!!! We have families and needs as affordable housing, food and self esteem. 
Please help those other countries in need of work with the money thrown away here on all this useless talk and bickering.
Introduce a program for our high school graduates of giving a year at menial jobs with an incentive for a reduced college education. Older workers unable to find work need assistance with learning new trades.
Help Americans to prosper with at least adequate income for basic necessities to eliminate this anti immigrant feeling.
