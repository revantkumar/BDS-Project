I am completely with the OPT STEM extension.

There are two types of foreign students doing STEM in USA, funded and non funded.

For the funded students, U.S. university or government money funds them, trains them, develops them in this country, their skills, knowledge and thinking process. Losing them due to improper working laws thereafter is a complete waste of resource for this very country.

For non funded students, many of them take education loan and make investments in USA education system. If these students are forced to leave country soon after completion, they will never make investments in U.S. education system as they will not be able to recover their loans, in the first place. Thus the education system will lose a very big revenue stream.

This is about the monetary sides of thing. Now about the training they get. The STEM foreign students are among the best analytical minds who are necessary to do the high skilled technical and analytical works required in the jobs of these types. If the U.S. employers do not get these talents, their competitors in other regions will get them and can lose out in competition though the talent has been developed in U.S.

If there was ample supply of these well trained skilled workers locally in abundance, these policy of extension was not required in first place. Since the lack and the demand was observed this policy came in the first place. Thus effectively, it was not hampering or taking away the jobs of the locals, rather fulfilling a gap which could not be fulfilled only with the talents available locally.
