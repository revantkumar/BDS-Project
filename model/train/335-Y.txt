I strongly agree with the proposal that we should improve and expand training opportunities for F1 nonimmigrant students.
In the first place, as we all know, the expenses of the students who are studying in the states can provide a decent income for the government and universities. Most of them would like to have their own cars and they will also pay the rent for the apartment. As long as they live here, they are powerful consumers. So letting students to be here having training opportunities can prolong the situation.
In the second place, it's natural to say that students who can get an offer from the company are skillful, so that it's understandable to extend the period because they can contribute to the prosperity of the country. 
In the third place, the states have so many universities and educate so many students, of course there should be more opportunities to intern here because it not only make the country more prosperous but also make people around the world be more confident about education in the states.It's a virtuous circle, more education, more intern, more prosperous.
Finally, the USA is a country of immigrants, we should be open about all the cultures on the Earth. Most of the students don't want to immigrate at all while they just want to have some work experiences.
In the final analysis, we should absolutely approve the issue.
