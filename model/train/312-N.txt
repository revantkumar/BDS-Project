When will American workers EVER be given a fair shake by this admin. Every trade agreement has been to America's detriment, the "amnesty" program is incredibly destructive to American workers at a time when over 100 million Americans are out of the work force. What's strange it's that while America's middle and lower classes are being run roughshod over the same group is the winner with all theses policys. Obama talks about income inequality but under his admin the rich keep getting richer while America's populace sinks deeper and deeper into poverty.
