It is important to understand that international students come to the USA and contribute to USA's growth, tech companies are booming because of this very reason. A lot of international business in both countries is based on the fact that a good education-exchange is supported. 

Europe has a lot of anti-foreign issues when it comes to employment post studies there and this has caused a decline in EU's growth. 

I think this rule is a boon and should not be scrapped off.
