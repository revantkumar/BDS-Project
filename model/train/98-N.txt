THIS IS AN OUTRAGE !!!

The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates, many of whom have very expensive student loans.
The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers, both current and future.
Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages. The market is already over-supplied.
OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers, which hurts US.
Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs, but it comes out of the paychecks of all other American workers.
OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas, and these limits are already way too high for the size of our economy and labor markets.
There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers in the U.S. If that were true, wages for such workers would be accelerating rapidly. They're not; wages for STEM workers have been flat for years. The same cannot be said for revenues for big tech employers. Those have been growing rapidly in recent years.
We graduate about 2x the number of STEM workers that we need each year, That's why I have met so many cab-driving engineers, Ph.D. waiters, etc.

American Voters Want:
- Less Immigrants, More Jobs For Americans, and NO AMNESTY FOR ILLEGALS !
Once these policies are in place, our economy will start to recover.
We should work to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !!!
