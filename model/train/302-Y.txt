1) United States has best colleges in the world and it is generous enough to admit best students all over the world. OPT extension allows these students having more opportunities working outside campus after graduation. And consequently, not only they can be better trained, but the US society will benefit a lot since these STEM students will make great contribution to US society in so many aspects. The industry need talents that can lead it to prosperity. And prosperity of the industry can create more job opportunities and develop the economy of this country. It's a win-win situation. 

2) US is a immigration country and it is made stronger and stronger by generations of outstanding immigrants. These students are likely to be outstanding enough since in order to get admitted by US colleges, they have to be the best in their country. If so, the OPT extension will allow them to have more opportunities to get a working visa so that they can contribute more to this country. If some of them are not good enough, they might just not be able to graduate or find a job, and consequently, they have to go back to their country soon no matter whether there's OPT extension or not. A healthy immigration system need to be aimed to keep talents, and talents need opportunities to show. 

3) If there's no OPT extension, even these students are able to find a job in US in their OPT period, 12 months give them little opportunity to get a working visa. It's like pushing them back. And in the meanwhile, the developing countries, like China, are spending so many efforts to attract these people back. It's just unwise to simply cancel the OPT extension.

4) As a conclusion, I strongly support the OPT extension.
