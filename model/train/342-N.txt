I oppose this draft regulation because it confers legal work status on a class of non-immigrant students or former students without subjecting them to the payroll tax requirements borne by nearly all working citizens and legal resident aliens. It is an undesirable precedent to carve out such as exemption, giving their employers an implicit subsidy and the aliens an edge in the competition for stem jobs over citizens and legal residents.
