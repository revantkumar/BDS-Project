I think it's total loss for the US either as aspect of finance or stability. You see international students count for large percentage and also stand out in grade-A ranking. They will bring new ideas and work harder than ever because they need to survive abroad. Besides, If the policy comes true, the number of oversea students will decreases rapidly and leads loss for university.
