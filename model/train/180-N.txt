I am a naturalized Indian American citizen and have been living in this country for 30 years. I know how many American jobs have been affected by allowing this OPT program for foreign students. I know that the 100's of thousands of Indian students with studetn VISA's who gradaute from Amrerican colleges who are supposed to go back to India after their training never go back and they use this as a breezeway( waiting period ) to stay in the U.S and get their Green cards. Because India is one of the most corrupt countries and the bureaucracy is so corrupt, bribing and lying and cheating is very common in India. People know of many Indians who have come here with false passports, false affidavits and false paperwork and since widespread corruption is a way of life in India, every Indian takes if for granted about cheating in college exams, drivers licenses and passports and VISA's. If you examine any Indian 's documents you will find in a majority of them there is something fishy. And on the job front, many American companies have gotten rid of AMerican employees and replaced them with college graduates from India. FIdelity Investments, HP, Microsoft all indulge in these nefarious activities where genuine Americans are laid off from work and replaced with these foreigners. I personally know of many american IT workers who have lost their jobs and unemployed while being replaced by foreign workers. SO please scrap this OPT program all together till such time American graduates get gainfully employed. EVery year 1 million American graduate from colleges and it is reported about 75% o them are either unemployed or under employed under this poor economy for the past 7 years. Again, SO please scrap this OPT program all together since there are many many American students with college science degrees who are struggling to find jobs
