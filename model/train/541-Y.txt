I got my PhD from Columbia University by the end of 2014, and I have been working for a major US oil company ever since. My company sponsors me H1B visa but I failed the lottery in 2015. Without the OPT STEM extension I will have to quit my well-paid job and go back to China. 
But it is not my personal interest that I want to argue for here. With my education and skill set I can live a pretty good life in China too.
My PhD project was funded by US National Science Foundation. I was granted $30,000 stipend every year, and another $30,000 for my tuition. US government has paid $360,000 for my education in the past six years, using tax money. Now I'm serving a US company, and using my knowledge to develop technologies that can reduce production cost of unconventional resources. US has gained great national interest through the unconventional revolution in oil industry, and I'm proud to be one of the scientists pushing the technology. I am paying back the country which supported my education. And all these can only continue to be possible with this new OPT extension policy.
