It seems unfair that the US readily welcomes international students to it's universities and institutes but when the time comes for these very students to enter the workforce it retracts it's welcome. With an increasing number of companies already winding down their recruitment of international applicants, it is only a matter of time that universities see the influx of international students dwindle. Extending training opportunities for non immigration students is a key step towards lofty "immigration reform".
