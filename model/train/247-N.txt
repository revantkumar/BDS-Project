These aren't "training opportunities" for "students"; they're full-time jobs for aliens who will displace American citizens. This rule, which is probably beyond the competence of HSD to make anyway, benefits aliens and large technology companies while further harming American workers. This proposed rule is obviously aimed at getting around the refusal of Congress, the proper lawmaking body, to increase the number of H1-B visas (itself an extremely harmful program, hence Congress' refusal to expand it).

When every American technology worker has a job within the industry is when we could consider allowing aliens to be employed, and not before. Even then, a better policy would be to force these companies to hire and train American citizens by not allowing them to import aliens for the sole purpose of taking American jobs away. The companies' sheer greed should not be allowed to determine public policy - the apparently have no concern for what happens when Americans can't find jobs any more. Shame on them, and shame on this policy which benefits them while hurting America as a whole.
