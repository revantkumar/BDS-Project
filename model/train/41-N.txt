If I am understanding this problem and it's programs, it would seem to me only fair and actually COMMON SENSE to have the Citizens have first chance at any jobs.
The idea of requiring any prospective employers to POST and ADVERTISE available jobs for a 90 day period, thus giving all citizen job seekers an opportunity before offering the jobs elsewhere makes perfect sense to me.
Could there possibly be a subversive motive behind the DHS attempting to bypass our citizens ? That notion should be investigated and then reviewed and discussed by all parties.
Something about this is simply vague and highly suspect to this citizen.
