The Optional Practice Training program you propose takes opportunity away from American students, who are qualified, and gives opportunity to foreign students. Further, it gives financial incentive to employers to do so. Why this proposal is being considered is beyond me. 

Please explain your reasoning at the earliest possible time. I am in favor of giving financial incentive to employers to hire American students and would like to know why you are not doing so.

Thank you.
