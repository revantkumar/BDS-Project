As an international student under STEM major, an extension of the OPT is of great importance for me as well as my peers. 

First, as more and more people apply for the limited H1B, the probability of getting approved for the H1B VISA is dramatically decreasing every year. Many international employees are forced to leave US due to this issue no matter how well they perform on their job position or how much profit they have contributed to the company or to US. 
This is obviously not fair at all to those talented hard working people.

Extending the OPT definitely gives more time, more chances to those people so that they can find a way to stay in US and continue to achieve their american dream and contribute to this beautiful country without worrying too much about their right to work here. 

Say yes to the OPT extension please.
Thanks.
