What is going on here? We're in America, but because of 'cheap labor' so to speak, you're throwing US under the bus! Why do U.S. employers get a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary? Obviously, you're using a huge loophole, but we all see it and it is revolting! DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.
If the bonus given to employers for hiring a STEM graduate is worth $10,000 under the old rules, it is now worth $12,000, and is that much more likely to cause an employer to hire a former F-1 student than a green card or citizen graduate. Look out for the American worker! It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates. Expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT)is anti-American and you should be ashamed of yourselves!
