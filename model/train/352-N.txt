What Kind of rule is this that DHS is trying to implement?This rule will bring more people into the country which will cause the pay rates reduced by the employers which in turn makes the lives of people already having H1 or any other Visa Permits like Green card etc or else even for the citizens of America very miserable to lead with their families...For example,If a family is having only one person earning and he has is wife and 2 children with current Job opportunities he might provide average middle class life to his family..If this rule gets implemented he might get lesser pay because the STEM programs bring much younger people into the Job market who do not have much responsibilities or family compared to the later and they will be willing to work for less pay this will make employers exploit the situation by saying the family person to work for lesser pay or quit the job...THIS WILL BRING HIS FAMILY ON TO ROAD THE DAY HE LOOSES HIS JOB..................I strongly oppose this rule for the reason I mentioned here...If the above reason is not enough I have some more reasons to oppose this rule which are:

1). An average H1 Visa holder who has better work experience will end up paying more taxes than the STEM 
program beneficiaries which is unethical.

2). STEM beneficiaries also have the liberty to change the employers while H1 visa holder do not have any such benefits even though he has problems with his employer which will make them more care free changing their jobs which might become problem for H1 visa holder who cannot shift his employer as easily as the STEM holder.

3). More than half the STEM beneficiaries do not work in the area they graduated as their is no one who will check on which area they are doing the work..Most of the foreign nationals especially Indians work in different areas than the area they got the degree from or else they will just pay some money to unethical employers and get a letter mentioning they work for that employer and get the approval for STEM extension and later they work illegally in Gas stations,Grocery stores etc..

4). Few months back there was another rule which got implemented to give Work permit for certain category of H4(Dependent) Visa holders now this new rule..According to initial figures there are around 180000 persons who are eligible for working...If I am not wrong not even 10% of the that number would have entered into any Job..Personally I know lot of people who are in this Visa category searching for Jobs but not getting any opportunities so if this new rule gets implemented than what justice that the other Visa holders would get?

5).America is land of dreams for many nations so there is no question to think that if STEM program beneficiaries are not allowed to stay in the country this country will not progress...Every Year new blood comes into the nation and out of which who have the merit to stay in the country will stay and the rest will go back but with this new rule lot of undeserved and unethical people will stay in America which in turn makes America not a land of dreams for future generations which could be a serious threat to the country in future years.

There are lot more problems with this rule but I want to stop here..................PLEASE STOP THIS RULE
