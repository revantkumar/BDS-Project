The F1 OPT STEM must be extended to at least 24 months. This increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. This is a crucial step towards allowing and encouraging the best and brightest students, who come here to receive a world-class education, the best incentives to stay and work, start businesses, and contribute to our economy. We need to give these students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S., and our nation thereby, every opportunity to benefit from their industry. The US educates and trains people to become the world's leaders in science, business and industry; rather than sending them away, we should be working to retain this talent.
