Regulations Dept of the US government,

OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.
I am a senior citizen and we can't even get a cost of living increase and we are allowing these students to extend their stay which then is not the original purpose to train them to go back to their country.

I hope and pray you will reject this idea.

Thank you,
Marguerite Bogosian
