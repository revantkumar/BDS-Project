As a senior HR in the tech industry I also say YES to this proposal. I understand that most people complained about foreign students stealing their jobs. But in reality, we don't have enough US citizens who majors in STEM and we American ourselves cannot satisfy the rapid development of our tech industry. That's why we do indeed need those foreign STEM students. Frankly speaking, a majority people complaining here still won't be able to secure a tech job even if we kick away foreign STEM students because there are TOO FEW American STEM students!!!
