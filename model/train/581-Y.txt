This will be a good decision to extend OPT STEM to 24 months. It will attract foreign students more to come and study in United States. And ultimately US will get more scholars and researchers from around the globe. This will be beneficial to US to continue with technological advancement (in all sectors like hardware, software, agriculture, etc) as it is now far ahead from rest of countries.
