As an international student with STEM degree, I strongly and sincerely hope that the new proposal from DHS can be approved for the following reasons.
First of all, high tech has become and will consistently remain the driving force to boost the economy of the country. During the last one hundred year, the US has witnessed the benefits of attracting legal immigrants with expertise from all over the world. Students with STEM degrees have the expertise necessary to work in such fields, thus if the US welcomes more of such employees to work here, it is very likely that the country will keep its advantage in the foreseeable future.
Secondly, students with STEM degrees are not taking jobs away from US citizens. On the contrary, the booming of high-tech is creating more jobs. According to US BLS statistics, the economy creates 3 jobs requiring a B.S. in computer science for every one college student.
STEM students should not be blamed for the problems and concerns that arise from current immigration administration. The reason why many STEM students need an extension of OPT is because they fail to get an H1B in the lottery. Thus to me, the problem can be potentially solved by revising the H1B application process, ensuring it's done fairly so that students graduating with STEM degrees can have their H1B in time.
