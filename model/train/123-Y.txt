I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because:

1. American universities spend a large amount of resources to train STEM students. If the US is going to simply let those highly trained students to go away, then the US is simply wasting its own resources. As a result, I believe the government should try to retain STEM students to contribute to the US.

2. Many people believe that retaining foreign STEM students create a competition against Americans in the job market. Even if we assume it is true, competition still does more good than bad in this case. Because for the US to maintain its dominating power in various field in the world, it must have the most competitive work force in the tech field. And increasing competition also urges local Americans to increase their capabilities as well. So this would increase the general competitiveness of talents within the US to face the rapidly changing world.

3. It's doubtful that OPT can cause bad competition for American workers. In my graduate school, there are only a few Americans STEM students. Yet almost all graduate students(foreign or American) are able to find a high-tech job after graduation. This means the high-tech job market is able to accommodate foreign STEM students, and the few numbers of American students are simply not enough for the high-tech fields in the US. 

4. The US was the land of freedom for immigrants. Most of the population of this country are descendants of people from all over the world. And this diversity is actually one of the factors that drive the US to become the leading, multicultural country on earth today. It is simply ridiculous to give up the faith in diversity for some short-sighted reasons.
