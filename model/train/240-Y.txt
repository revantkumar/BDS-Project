This amendment is not only important to all international students in STEM majors, but also crucial to the U.S. society. It is definitely beneficial for the U.S. to encourage these STEM major graduates to stay and work in the U.S. because they advance knowledge in science and technology tremendously. Allowing for a 24 month OPT extension gives the STEM major graduates a longer period to legally work in the U.S. without H1B visa. The OPT (F1) visa is still a non-immigrant VISA, which is less likely to impact the immigrant policy significantly.
