These proposed changes are very important for international students already in US and students planning to get STEM degrees from US. This rule being vacated would not only affect the students and employers currently employed but the admissions would fall drastically. As per my knowledge most students in graduate and research degrees are international students and this rule provides them a extended 24 months of training period after achieving their degrees which is very helpful.

I strongly support this rule as this is very useful both American economy and International Students.
