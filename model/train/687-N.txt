Why do we educate our own young people and then turn around an import workers to displace our own people? This makes no sense at all. Australia and New Zealand have very strict immigration laws and their nominal minimum wage is $19/hr and $12/hr respectively.

We do not need any more foreigners in our country. We need a strong and vibrant American workforce who will contribute to our country and our culture.

Stop issuing all H1B visas. Close our border and restrict all visas.
