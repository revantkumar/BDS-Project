I completely agree with the STEM OPT extension of 24 months. One point I believe that can be added to this proposal is regarding the ability of international students on OPT to re-enter the United States. Many students on the OPT extensions have expired F-1 visas after they have graduated from a university. Due to this, they are not allowed to re-enter the United States if they go to visit their home countries during their OPT status.

If the proposal would include the opportunity for students on OPT to leave and re-enter the United States freely, it would avoid the current problem of many international students effectively being locked in the United States while they are working here on OPT.It makes no sense to deprive international students of their ability to visit their families while they are working here on OPT.
