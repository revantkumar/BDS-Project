I am not in favor of this program. It hurts American workers. If the U.S. needs these foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? Between 2009 and 1013 430,000 Americans were denied jobs. I would also like to know why OPT is taking money from Americans--from our Social Security and Medicare programs.
Please protect American workers not foreign workers.
Thank you.
