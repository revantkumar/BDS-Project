I fully support this move made by the US Government. Extending the OPT period to 24 months will not only benefit the 
students with a better industry exposure , but will also help them to pay off their loans. This will give more financial freedom
to the students and they can start something on their own once they go back to their respective countries. This was very 
much required and rightly done !!
