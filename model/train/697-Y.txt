As a recently graduated F-1 student, I strongly support the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. 

When I decided to go for my master's degree in US, the major thing attracted me here is the long time training OPT opportunities.Now if the OPT go back to only 12 months, after months of finding jobs, I only have about half a year at most to gain real work experience. I don't think those several months of work experience will help my career when I go back to China. And I am not the only one who have these concerns. For those students who are about to go abroad, they will consider other countries like Canada, United Kingdom and Australia who have more strategies to attract international students than US because of only 12 months OPT.

From the country's respective, expanding STEM OPT will continually attract talented people from the world instead of pushing them away to other countries and eventually promote the development of US.
