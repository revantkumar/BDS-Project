e Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students and recent college graduates over Americans. This program has never been authorized by Congress. Currently, foreign students who have been pursuing their degree for at least 9 months can work in the U.S. for 12 months or 29 months if pursuing a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree. The new rule would extend the program's length from 12 months to 36 months for these STEM students. The program incentivizes U.S. companies to hire foreign students and recent graduates because they do not have to pay the prevailing wage or their share of the 7.65% payroll taxes for the foreign worker, costing Social Security an estimated $1 billion dollars a year.

"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 yearsthe same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be validthere is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley
"...expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT)through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visasbut do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields."
ALF-CIO President Richard Trumpka

Don't be stupid. Cease these foreign immigrations that undercut American workers.
