I am against OPT program as this makes it very hard for American fresh graduates to get internship or a job. Companies hire OPT F1 students instead of American skilled workers or American fresh graduates as these companies underpay the OPT F1 students and they save on Payroll taxes - this is not fair to Americans!!! I am against OPT program as this program is abused by foreigners and the companies for profit...
