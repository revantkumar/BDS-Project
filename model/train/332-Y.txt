I strongly support the proposal rule of ODT extension. It absolutely makes perfect sense.

1. Look at the statistical data and analysis on the website of United States Department of Labor published this year.
http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm
In the STEM labor market, there is huge demand for software engineers, petroleum engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and many others, especially at the advanced-level degree. 
Economic projections point to a need for approximately 1,000,000 more STEM professionals than the U.S. will produce at the current rate over the next decade if the country is to retain its historical preeminence in science and technology-Quote from Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology
I doubt if this demand can be met without hiring any talented educated STEM international students.

2. STEM international students are NOT YOUNG CHEAP LABORS. 
Look at the LCA H1B wage that is public. The STEM international students are treated the same as American citizen workers. They get paid great. The companies hire them, mentor them, train them and pay them great during OPT period, BECAUSE the companies want those students to stay for long term, BECAUSE those students are talented, educated and have high potential to make MUCH MORE contributions to the companies. That eventually makes the fortune for the nation and benefits the development of science and technology and US economy. 

BTW, stop talking DISNEY LAYOFF. DISNEY Company is not even in the E-verify system. This is off the topic. 

Many forget U.S. is a nation built by immigrants. They came to America for a great dream, freedom, and opportunity. If the people abide by the law, work hard, and are willing to make the contribution to the nation, they are supposed to deserve an opportunity, an opportunity to pursue their dream that they believe important.
