I oppose the proposed OPT expansion and the program should be eliminated completely. 50% of Science, Technology, and Mathematics graduates in this country do not get jobs in the STEM fields. It is obvious what is going on - business is importing cheap skilled labor. There are 10 million U.S. STEM workers without jobs in STEM fields. MicroSoft and Hewlett Packard are laying off tens of thousands of workers, but we want to import more foreign workers to compete with Americans for jobs in the United States? F-1 student visas for three years is an end run around Congressional limits on H-1b 3 year work visas.
