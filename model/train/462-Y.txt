This is definitely good for USA. First of all, many people with high technology skill will be attracted to come to american to study and to work. Do you know how much money international student have contribute to the development of our university and our GDP. what's more, 21 century is a knowledge century, world is becoming more and more flat. USA need more genius to help USA become more powerful. If we let theses smart people go back to their country to develop their industry. Their country will develop much more faster than before. So USA will lose it's powerful to develop the most amazing technology in the world. Secondly, Many smart people contribute to the future of american. They come to USA when they are young. What's more this is the best time of their life. They work for our country and when they are old and disable, they go back to their country. They become a burden to their country, and USA will become a young country, however other country in this world will become more and more old. This make USA more powerful in the future. Thirdly, These student didn't compete with the farmer in USA, many job related to the security of our country didn't offer the job chance to these international student. Only the student who is smart enough and excellent enough will be able to get a job in such a competitive job market. So these student won't effect local people in USA. We like international student, most of them bring the money to our country and left, a little genius come and work for our country. That a great idea and trade for USA.
