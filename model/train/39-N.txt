By extending the F-1 program you are taking away job from qualified AMERICAN workers and telling companies that profit is more important them helping AMERICANS get jobs. There are millions of AMERICANS out of work that are qualified and willing to work. By extending the F-1 program you are also sending a message to the Nonimmigrant students that the rules and regulations do not apply to them. If you are realy interested in making AMERICA a great NATION again, then enforce the rules that are on the books and stop helping big industry make more profit and destroy AMERICA. Stop giving our jobs to foreign students who will use the technology against us latter on, Keep AMERICA strong by keeping our jobs filled with AMERICAN workers/students that are loyal to AMERICA.
