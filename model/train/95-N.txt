I am opposed to the administration's attempt to expand the program called OPT (Optional Practical Training). This program is to allow those foreign students with F-1 student visa to work for up to 12 months in a job that is related to their field of study. This is for students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics or STEM. 

Last year, the Center for Immigration Studies found that this program CAN have an ADVERSE impact on American Tech workers. For example: there were 497,274 work authorizations granted through OPT between 2009 and 2015. These workers AND their employers are exempt from payroll taxes costing the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds $4,000,000,000. (that's 4 BILLION DOLLARS). Also, employers are not required to pay prevailing wages meaning they can hire OPT workers for lower wages than American workers performing the same tasks.

The OPT program was designed to allow the students to gain work experience while they study so that they can return to their country. INSTEAD-this proposed rule would help create a bridge to an H-1B tech-worker visa and possibly eventual employment.

This amounts to the administration caving in to tech companies giving them the cheap labor they want, and essentially turning their backs on AMERICAN tech workers (where they would have to pay taxes and the prevailing wage). How will this help AMERICANS studying STEM get jobs?

A group of tech workers, the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers had sued the federal government-they showed that indeed, there would be lost jobs and wages for AMERICAN tech workers which is why the federal government is going through this rule making process.

Let's have some fairness to American Tech Workers! Leave the amount of time F-1 student visa can work at 12 months!
