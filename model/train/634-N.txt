Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.

The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be 

detrimental to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire 

foreign citizens, and artificially expand the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, 

and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers.

Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the 

employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.
