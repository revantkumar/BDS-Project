What we could learn from the rapid development of the USA in the recent 50 years is that the USA is a country of diversity and freedom and it can absorb the energy of every single person in it and make itself better. It is also one of the most important reasons which makes this country stands at the top 1 in the world all the time. From the success of internet tech, first computer, first step to the moon, first nuclear bomb, we could always see the distribution of STEM students originally from other countries. The reason they have chosen the USA is that USA chose them as well which makes the USA keep being powerful and also attract all the elites from all over the world.
