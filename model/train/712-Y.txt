I highly SUPPORT the proposal. Allowing student to have an OPT extension will benefit the US society.

1. By allowing international students to stay in US for longer time, employers will have the opportunity to expose to more potential candidates, and will have a better chance to select the best employee for a position. 

2. International students will bring diversity to the society and diversity is the source of innovation. US economy has greatly benefited from technology innovation, and obviously the trend will go on for the next few decades. US needs innovation, and thus needs diverse pool of talents.

3. If not allowing more international students, US colleges are not able to provide sufficient domestic talents for specific areas. For ares like computer industry, the industry is developing so quickly and local students can't fulfill the talent break. Not allowing firms to recruit enough employees is setting barriers for their development, and US should not fall behind this development.
