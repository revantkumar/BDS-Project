In recent years 70% of American jobs for males in the age group 16-24 have gone to foreign workers. This has caused many of the young Americans graduating from Universities or moving into the job market directly out of High School to become unemployed. There is no excuse for this, our government has been pandering to the corporations and causing undo economic hardship for many young Americans. Issuing work visas to foreign nationals so they can work in our country is unconscionable when we have so many in this country are capable of filling these positions. Many of these foreign workers are sending money to their families in their home country and not putting that money back into the economy. We seriously need to work on making sure American citizens have jobs instead of bringing in more foreign workers.
