Expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees will have a huge impact on keeping and attracting the talents to United States from all over the world.

Students with STEM degrees are currently on high demand by the US market. The majority of them have already obtained a job and played an important role in the world-class companies, and these companies are making profits though the talent, professionalism and expertise from these students. The current OPT is only valid for 12 months which means they only have one opportunity to win the H1b lottery, and the chance of winning is becoming lower and lower in the past couple of years. Without extending their training opportunities, they have no choice but going back to their own country. This would be a huge loss to the United States.

Seven years ago when I chose my graduate school, my advisor strongly recommended me coming to the United States because it is the research center of my major. In this place I can meet the best people, enjoy the best training and expose to the most cutting-edge research topics. I think this kind of story does not incidentally happen to me but apply to people in many other field as well, and that is why the United States are the No.1 choice for many international students all along the time. In retrospective, the contributions from these excellent students are making US even stronger. If there is only a very limited time of training after graduation, I'm afraid this wonderland would not be that attractive to these dreamer chasers.

Therefore, extending the training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees to an appropriate period of time (24 months) should not be a claim that we negotiate on the table, but a "must-go" policy that benefits the United States for now and the future.
