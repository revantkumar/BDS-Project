I think this rule is very important and will help too many international students, and will improve american's economy too. As far as I know, the reason why America is so good growing is partially because America is accepting all talents from the world and hence have best technology in the world. I hope America can have this great tradition for long and keep attracting great talents from the whole world, and continue to be the most powerful country in the world.
