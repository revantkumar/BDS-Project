First of all I would like to thanks DHS for coming up with this proposal. I believe many students like me have come to United States to attain world class education. My reason and probably the reason of many other international students for choosing America as educational destination is mostly due to its alignment towards imparting updated industrial knowledge, connection between industries and educational institutions. 

Like every good teacher wants its students to excel in the field of study, I believe 'students of America' also want to receive same knowledge and equal learning experience in industry as provided to American students. You might agree with me 12 months is a very short period of time to understand and absorb a company's culture. And, having done an internship at one of the leading company of United States, time flies by and you learn a lot yet so less. Therefore I urge the law makers to Pass this law and gives us a 24 extra months to complete our education. 

We learn a lot about America and absorb its culture from the first day we land here. Student to a good resource transition is like growing from being a child to an adult. So, I request you to kindly let my education be complete and allow me become an adult.

I have read through the document and I completely support it.
