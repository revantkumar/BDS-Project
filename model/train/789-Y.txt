The fact is that our universities and national institutes have been spending millions of dollars each year to support excellent international students from all over the world to study here in the States. 

As far as I see, most of the foreign students love American. Many of them choose to stay after graduation and continue making great contributions to the country. Do we really want to see them leaving right after graduation? What makes American a great country? 

We should set our bar higher to only accept the best international students to come to the States and, in the meanwhile, grant those students who have worked so hard the opportunities they deserved to work for a reasonably long enough time to show their abilities and potentials. It will be such a pity if we missing the smart young minds. 

Therefore, I strongly support the proposal.
