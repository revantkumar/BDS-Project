I strongly support the extension. Actually I without OPT i don't see it makes a lot of sense to go to US to further study. UK's prestigious universities like Cambridge and Oxford are more open to foreign student, and they have a longer history in Higher Education. Most foreign student aims to get some experience from advanced studies in US and then go back to their home countries for advance development in their career. Without OPT extension US definitely loses lot of its attractiveness in Higher Education and lose some resource brought by foreign student to boost economy.
