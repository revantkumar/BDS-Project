Its a very good rule , it will have a very good economic impact on the USA Economy as more the talent in the country, more the country can prosper, STEM student start companies which results in increased employment and productivity of a country, student with STEM degree is really important for any country, A STEM student can find opportunity in any country, but if he chooses to serve USA, he/she should be given opportunity and level field so that he can contribute for the betterment of USA. So I will give a thumbs up to the new rule and the organisation for doing it.
