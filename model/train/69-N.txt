To Whom this may concern,

Expanding the OPT program that benefits foreign nationals at the expense of American citizens is treasonous! Americans depend upon our government to protect us and implement policies that benefit us not corporations or foreign nationals.
We demand that our government put the interests of American citizens first and that Congress close loopholes in immigration laws that currently benefit corporations over our own people. We want a moratorium on immigration until Americans can be stabilized in the job market. We are tired of this subversive, globalist agenda that is destroying our great nation.

It is time that our government be of the people, by the people and FOR THE PEOPLE. Americans citizens deserve better from our elected officials!
