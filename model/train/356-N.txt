When my son was in engineering school I saw footage on youtube of lawyers giving seminars to how not to hire an
American legally in order to hire a foreigner for lower wages. They gave the proper procedures from where to advertise
and how to circumvent the law. That was six years ago! My son found a job after submitting applications for 1.5 years after graduating with high honors with a double major from engineering school. He believes that his wages are being suppressed even though he is a valued employee who has been sent to Paris and Quebec to improve and integrate software of a company that his firm purchased. His financee, who claims that she does not have the aptitude to do the 3D development that my son does, but works on software for Wall Street, earns $45K more annually than my son. The developers and programmers at her firm have to be American citizens. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the discrepancy in wages. And now with the movement to bring in more foreign workers with more Hb1s visas and the OPT program, the American worker and the STEM graduates will not have jobs. In the last seven years there are more STEM graduates than jobs, an over supply of workers, why do we have to increase the number of foreign workers in such an environment? Why give employers the motivation to hire foreigners instead of Americans in not requiring them to pay payroll taxes for the foreign worker when the very programs that the payroll deductions provide, social security and medicare are going bankrupt?The incentive should be to increase payroll tax contributions. Why is it that our president and his administration and agencies as well as our elected representatives do not represent Americans anymore and prefer to displace the American worker with foreigners? This is being done by our ruling elites to the unskilled lower wage worker as well as to the STEM graduates and workers.
