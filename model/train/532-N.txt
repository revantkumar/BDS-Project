THe Department of Homeland Security is proposing a rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students and recent college graduates rather than Americans. This program has never been authorized by Congress. Currently, foreign students who have been pursuing their degree for at least 9 months can work in the U.S. for 12 months or 29 months if pursuing a science, technology, engineering, the new rule would extend the program's length from 12 months to 36 months for these STEM students further harming US workers. The program incentivizes U.S. companies to hire foreign students and recent graduates because they do not have to pay the prevailing wage or their share of the 7.65% payroll taxes for the foreign worker, costing Social Security an estimated $1 billion dollars a year. It is time we considered the needs of or own citizens over selfish corporate needs. It is this very thing that has so many Americans upset, so much so, that in the next November election, they will turn out in droves to turn out Congressmen who do nothing to stop big money influence in the DC.
