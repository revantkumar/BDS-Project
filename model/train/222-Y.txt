This is definitely a great proposal. As an international student in Engineering major, I came to US 2 years ago. I was promised to get an OPT extension for 17 month, and I planed my career path according to this rule. I still remembered the excitement when I landed Washington DC, "Here I am, the land of promise", I spoke to myself. But 2 years later, suddenly OPT extension is revoked, it seems that I have to leave this country if I do not have the luck to get H1B. I went to here to chase my American dream, and I was feeling that American dream does not consider non-US citizens, all of my hard working, my life planning, will not work out here. "Land of promise" seems ridiculous, and we are just the victim of politics. Now I am glad that this new proposal came out, definitely thousands of international students will benefit from this rule. And also, for people who want to come here in the future, they will still have the confidence in America's promise, instead of considering all the rules unreliable and irredeemable.
