The OPT has demonstrated to promote economy in the past few years as expected. The new OPT proposal tends to make up the old ones. It is no doubt that the new OPT policy will continue to promote U.S. economy and industry. Additionally, OPT offers opportunities to foreigners who studied in U.S. to practice their skills, which can be seen as a necessary part of training after academic education. Academic education + training = complete education system. This will of course attract more and more students in the world to pursue their study in U.S.
