How can you possibly give priority to non citizens over citizens with the STEM program. I am a citizen and a tax payer. My son with good grades and a BS in physics hunted for two years to find a job. Many other young people are jobless. My granddaughter graduates from college with a double major in biology and chemistry. Are you telling me she will have to compete with non citizens who will given a priority?
