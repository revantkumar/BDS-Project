The program is being misused by corporations to enable them to use foreign workers at a lower wadge to replace qualified AMERICAN WORKERS. These companies do not care about the AMERICAN WORKER, they only care about their bottom line. They LIE and say " There are not enough workers in this country to fill the jobs." The AMERICAN PEOPLE need to hold these corporations accountable for their lies. The facts have proven that there are plenty of AMERICAN WORKERS to fill the positions. We must put AMERICAN WORKERS into these positions,if not only to make AMERICA STRONG but also to keep advancements out of unfriendly hands. Keep AMERICA STRONG by using AMERICAN WORKERS.
