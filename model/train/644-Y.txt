Below are some of my thoughts about this policy:

Institutions of higher learning are a center of innovation and crucial to the progress of United States. Many brilliant students from all over the world arrive at the shores of the US to benefit from an ecosystem that values creativity, inventiveness and risk taking. 

It is a great loss of the United States when such students leave the US, especially those students who have entrepreneurial potential to create jobs in the country. Restricting the duration of students to stay in the US will only be detrimental to the ecosystem of technology companies whose competitive capacity relies on the quality of students that graduate out of US schools. 

A possible improvement to the student immigration could be strengthening student selection process in universities and the e-verify approved employer list. 

As a former F-1 student visa holder and being currently on H1B, I can say from my experience that a minimum of 3 years is required for OPT so that a student can spend a reasonable amount of time at a company to effectively complete his/her learning and for the company to gain in terms of substantial contribution from the international student. This is mutually symbiotic and removes any immigration fear/uncertainties for both the student and the US company in order to achieve the best results for both. 

Sincerely,
Krishna
