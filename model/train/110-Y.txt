I strongly support OPT extension from 17 to 24 months. 
STEM education is the key to the U.S. economic future. There has been a long time debate going on whether STEM OPT foreign students/workers "steal" the jobs from the U.S. citizens. Meanwhile, vacancies for STEM are going unfilled in large numbers. A recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics states that the U.S. is not graduating enough students with skills in science, math and technology to meet the growing demand for tech company workers - a point confirmed by data from the2015 U.S. News/Raytheon STEM Index. The U.S. will need "approximately 1 million more STEM professionals than the U.S. will produce at the current rate over the next decade if the country is to retain its historical preeminence in science and technology," according to the BLS report.
Thus, extension of STEM OPT will allow to fill the positions and benefit the U.S. economy. Foreign student usually pay out -of-state tuition which is significantly higher than what the U.S. citizens pay. This also adds up to the economy. I agree that the U.S. citizens have to be given priority in terms of employment , but if there is a deficit of workers to number of positions created, then that it is a reasonable step to give those positions to STEM OPT workers in order to eschew delay in innovative solutions, productivity and economic benefit as a result. Which undoubtedly positively affects many aspects of the U.S. society starting from banking system to medical field which directly depend on tech innovations .
