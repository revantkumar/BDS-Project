I strongly support the newly proposed rule. This would definitely enable the students to gain some professional experience in their field of expertise before they get their H1B. This is beneficial to both the companies (US on a broader note) and students in terms of their individual growths. Imagining the amount of talent that will be additionally put with this extension, I stand by this rule.
