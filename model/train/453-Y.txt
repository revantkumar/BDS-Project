I am just "amazed" how people full of animosity toward foreign students commenting " stop giving priorities to foreign nationals, enough is enough ", someone left a comment saying "my son work with some of the STEM workers and they are less educated than american workers, so he has to spend more time with them explaining"...Those " so-called less-educated workers have gotten higher GRE score , GPA and higher performance at work places. Firstly, the United states of America is the country which has been giving opportunities to a great number of foreign nationals who over centuries helped building the country and now it's called superpower. Look back and see what your ancestors were ? They were foreign nationals who came here once, were given an opportunity and contributed to the better future of the country. That's why AMERICA is associated with the greatest opportunities in the world. That's why it's respected. That is why it is called AMERICA.No matter what ethnicity you are,age or gender if you are innovative, if you have idea, if you are good at what you do and can contribute AMERICA welcomes you. Hasn't it been the philosophy which this country followed over the centuries? And it's a great thing. That is what makes America distinct , attractive and prosperous. Speaking of STEM students\ worker, this category of the American society is highly educated, motivated and disciplined people who came here LEGALLY. And most importantly they benefit the state and society economically. I am absolutely in support of STEM OPT extension.

Thank you ,
