For to long the U.S. Government has been overly concerned for foreign workers and immigrants while preventing American citizens from obtaining American jobs. 45% of Americans are unemployed now and the few who are employed are in many cases underemployed. There are no jobs that Americans will not do or are not educated well enough to be an asset to any company. We have so many college graduates who are burdened with student loans who have not been able to get work in the fields they possess degrees in because we have been overrun with cheap labor bringing down wages for Americans so badly due to companies abusing the Work Visa programs. No one should be put before Americans in America!! PERIOD!! If these people want an education,let them get it the American war with hard work and paying their own way!!!
