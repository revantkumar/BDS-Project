As one who has had to train their Indian replacement, I can't see how foreigners know more than Americans when we have to train them. We all know what this about. It's cheap labor and no benefits...or very few benefits. American companies need to be patriotic and start hiring Americans and doing business in America again! We can make quality stuff. We've proved it. It's time for Congress to start acting like Americans once more!
