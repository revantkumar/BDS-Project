I strongly support the opt extension for F1 students. Foreign students now take up huge percetage in engineering school within United States. Take our school for example, over half of the students are from foreign countries in grad school. It would be a great loss for United States if these students, educated in United States, learned all the technology, wanting to serve themselves in the U.S., leave US because of lost of H1B lottery. I know several excellent students have to leave even when the opt period is 29 months. Some of them go to UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore or back to their own countries while now contributing their knowledge and became great leaders in all fields. I believe the opt extension would help hold the really excellent students who hope to stay and devote themselves to a country that cultivates them and they love, which would surely boost the economy of US. Nowadays STEM plays a more and more important role in the economy. The advantage of foreign students is that they usually have a broader and global view on the development, and can serve as very good connections between countries, leading to a better job market and probably would create more jobs in US. These talents would attract more talents to US, to realize their American dreams not disturbed by the opt or H1B process.
