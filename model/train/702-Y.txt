STEM equals hope. The new policy sounds reasonable and will be great for international students to consider when they decide to study in the U.S. This is good for both international students and domestic students, who grow and learn together. I do career services and help my students get jobs. I have seen no difference in pay for international students, and more jobs than we can fill with certain digital expertise. It's only fair that all students graduating with the same degree and specific expertise be given equal opportunity to work and thrive in their fields. Without STEM we would lose some talented students that add to the diversity or our country and the educational experiences for all students.
