I strongly support this rule. The DHS has done a great job in keeping in mind the interests of the citizens of this country and also making sure that USA remains as a preferred destination for International Students.
Following are some of the great improvements done by DHS :

1. Introduced a training and mentoring plan. This will ensure that this STEM Extension program is not abused and requires that all students on STEM extension work in the area related to their field of study.
2. This rule brings about a clause that a US citizen is not being replaced by a STEM worker. This is great because it protects the rights of the citizens.
3. ICE can now do site visits to check that students on STEM extensions are undergoing their training like stated above. This will ensure that this program is not misused.
4. This will greatly enhance the education sector of the United States since International students will continue to make the USA their preferred destination for study and research.

Overall I really appreciate the DHS to keep in mind the concerns of the citizens of this country before making this rule.
