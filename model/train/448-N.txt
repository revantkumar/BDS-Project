Gentlemen:

After reviewing the proposed changes to the F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees program, I have come to the conclusion that the changes should be rejected. I believe that US businesses should be spending more resources on developing the citizens of this country and not constantly be focusing on noncitizens and foreigners. 

There are so many foreigners in this country now and this measure only increases those numbers. Also, we seem to have no control over students staying in the country illegally once they get here and once their studies have ended. That is truly unfortunate and is a true failure of our government and of Homeland Security.

I would like this proposal to be rejected.

Thank you very much,

Walt Christen
