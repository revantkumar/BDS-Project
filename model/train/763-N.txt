ICEB:

This program is not justified by way of expense nor of its damage to the economy or American workers. The facts are:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Employers should not receive incentives to hire from this pool.

The program is inadequately supervised; the federal government cannot identify the whereabouts of thousands of students and foreign workers.

The program patently discriminates against Americans.If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?
If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?
