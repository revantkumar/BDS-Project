America's prosperity largely relies on the work and contribution of immigrants, especially in technological area. It would be dangerous for the U.S. if the OPT extension is cancelled. The U.S. has been attracting excellent immigrants for a long time because of its open attitude towards them. The legend in Silicon Valley can be attributed mostly to the employees from developing countries like India, China. Without those people's hard work, America wouldn't keep its leading position in IT industry. The OPT extension is proposed for keeping in America the brilliant young elites with knowledge in high-tech. Now the competitions in IT industry is so fierce. I think the American people should consider this issue reasonably and carefully if they still want to keep their leading in the future world.
