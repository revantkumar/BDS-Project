Why on earth is our own government working against the interest, and livelihood, of its own citizens and legal immigrants? Why are they kowtowing to businesses who can import foreign workers who will not have to pay taxes or into Social Security? And why are they not even required to pay them minimum wage?
Why when tens of millions of Americans are out of work or severely underemployed?
Why when American graduates with STEM degrees cannot find jobs?
What is going on in this country? What is the underlying reason for this?
It must stop!
