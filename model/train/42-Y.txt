This proposal should come into place. The whole country's economy is packed with a lot of immigrants. Once you drop it all of sudden, it smashes the whole United States. As an International student who received my Masters and doing a great job here, I can understand the frustration of citizens of United States. But there should be a proper way to help them without ruining lives of many students who came here with lot dreams. If there is a plan to stop a lot immigrants, government should take proper care in the future but not sending people back abruptly.
