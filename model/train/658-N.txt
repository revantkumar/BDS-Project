Please do NOT expand this program. We (U.S. Citizens) are already at a record low for Americans employed. Even though the unemployment rate is lower, it is not a true reflection of the number of people out of work, merely the number of people on the unemployment rolls. Congress should be writing laws and the executive brand enforcing them. This is another end run around the legislative branch.
