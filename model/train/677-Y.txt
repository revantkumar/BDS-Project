I strongly support this rull.
1. If OPT has only 1 year, most foreign students will not come to US for a degree, since their expense is so high while they cannot get enough experience. In this case, US will lost a lot of cash brought by those people.
2. Tech companies will not be as competitive as now without this rule. I work at a tech company, most people in our Software team came from other countries. I can't imagine how this company would work without all those intelligent people.
