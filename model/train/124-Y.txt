I strongly agree with IMPROVING and EXPANDING STEM Degress F1 Student OPT period to 24 months!

As we all know, STEM degree Student are all from high technology fields, have devoted great contributions to US. At same time, there have a lot of STEM students working in Silicon Valley which have great commitment for the first class high technology companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc. It is no doubt that the OPT students working very hard, contribute a lot effort to help American keep No.1 in the world. 
Secondly, with more and more competitive in H1-B lottery and the limitation of visa numbers, no one can guarantee that most talent STEM OPT student would definiately get H1-B visa. Expanding OPT period would help them get another more oppoturnities to receive H1-B qualifications, which also a great benefit for the high technology company that they do not need to worry about losing genius. As you know, hiring and training a perfect match cadidate for a position need to spend a lot of money and time, if the intelligent OPT students have to leave their job just because the visa status, that would be a great and unimaginable loss for US. 

Please EPANDING STEM Degress F1 OPT period to 24 months. That would be the double benefits for both US develpment and earn reputation in the world.
