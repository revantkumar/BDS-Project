I strongly support this policy.

I am an Uber driver in Atlanta. And there are a lot of international students using Uber here since most of them do not have a car. This is a big part of my income. And generally speaking, these international students are very nice and friendly. I really enjoy talking to them and listen to their stories. After all, America should be the country which embrace diversity most in the world.
