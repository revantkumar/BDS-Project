Why has our government, the government that we elect and are supposed to represent the tax citizens of the United States, are choosing to support Foreign Students over United States Students? It is blatantly crony capitalism. and immoral. Our own government has totally turned into a tyranny, who favor other countries over our own. It is quite clear that our government is NOT on our side, nor have they been for quite some time. When are you going to start listening, because the peasants are starting to rumble? I want to make it known that we are tired of being trodden on. We will find out just who votes for this terrible bill and just how much you got paid for it. Let it also be know that every single Company who hire a foreign student over the the top of Americans will be boycotted. You hear that Disney? I will never visit another one of your parks, nor buy any of your products, nor see or purchase any of your movies. I'm done with Disney and I'm done with every other company who isn't on our side.
