Explain to the American citizens "Why are we not training our own people for these jobs?" We presently have 50 million Americans unemployed, 48 million on food stamps and our American leaders have the nerve to even think about such a program. What is even worse is they want American taxpayers to pay for it so they can give their job away to a foreigner! Furthermore, you want Americans to give up their jobs to foreign workers that will not pay into Social Security or Medicare. So, not only are we losing our jobs, but we get to watch our parents suffer on decreased Social Security and Medicare benefits. Additionally, we cannot do anything to help them because we have no job and no money to help them. You really are testing the stupidity of Americans with this one! If Corporations need workers start training Americans Only! Who do they think will buy their products with half of Americans unemployed and those with a job making peanuts? I will answer my own question "Corporations will sell and make profit from all those emerging foreign markets that have their children sending money to their foreign homes from the USA." 

Our political leadership spends more time lately coming up with more ways to increase the "real" unemployment rate than the do creating jobs here in their home, the USA. We truly are living in the Twilight Zone!
