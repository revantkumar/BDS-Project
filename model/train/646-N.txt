Give the jobs to Americans. Keep our jobs for Americans. There are plenty of Americans that are out of jobs. They have families they need to feed. 

Put the people on welfare to work. Make those who are able to work "work". Don't give a choice. 

This will decrease our unemployed rate besides decrease the welfare that is received by able bodied people who can work. Welfare is not an entilement.
