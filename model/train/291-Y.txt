Hi,

I support the new STEM OPT Extension rule. This will help students gain practical industrial exposure in a thriving industrial environment setup in U.S.A. After the academic learning availed from the STEM programs, allowing students to learn the applications and contribute to the industry in U.S.A will shape the students mind to achieve big and also in return will benefit the industry to retain talent and grow bigger and generate revenue to U.S.A.

Thanks,
Abilash
