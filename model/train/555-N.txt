This is a complete travesty for Americans with degrees in these fields. I have a daughter that graduated with the highest scores in her field (digital art - i.e. digital animation) and was unable to find a job. Why? Because American companies have been abusing the H-1B visas (like Disney) to hire low cost employees from foreign companies in lieu of American citizens, putting Americans out of work just so they can lower their expenses and show a higher profit.... all for the greed of the dollar. The same is obvious on the west coast as well. Ever checked the names in the credits at the end of movies with animation? They're virtually all Asian names... and they don't live here. They farm the work out to foreign companies. Fewer American jobs. The entertainment industry and Microsoft as well are sweeping the floor of Congress with their bought and paid for legislators. Only our administration can clamp down on this... it's sending middle class Americans to the poor-house!
