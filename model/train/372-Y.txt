Immigration is an issue in the United States. This is a great opportunity to increase support for legal immigration of highly skilled, tax paying persons, rather than creating further incentives for illegal immigration. 

We need to extend the OPT period for international students. It allows for more time to apply for the H1B lottery, and to integrate into the US culture. These students are looking to assimilate, and pay taxes; not just immigrate and leech off the system.
