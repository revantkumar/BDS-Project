I STRONGLY recommend this proposed rule. Companies (and the U.S. economy) can benefit from hiring a various diverse group of candidates that are competitive in their skills without worrying the 1-year limitation. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields are fields that have a long term impact to a country. This proposed rule of extension would help America stay competitive in STEM fields.
