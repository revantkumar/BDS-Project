With so many Americans unable to afford college, many of them "the best and the brightest", or deep in debt after college, and so many kids disadvantaged by fractured families, poverty, violence at home and neighborhoods, why oh why do we not focus on THEM?

Cheaper labor by foreigners over giving Americans a chance? NO!

The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
