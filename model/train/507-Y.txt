I totally support this regulation. If the extension policy will be objected. Many high-skill workers have to leave the country. Plenty of companies will lose their employees suddenly. Dramatically influence their working and damage American's economy. And these high-tech workers would not come back again and go back to their own countries. That's another lose for America.
