We should teach all those wanting an education in our country whether they are citizens or immigrants, legal or not. The problem is limited resources. With wars to fight, massive debt, out of balance budgets, and a painful financial sequester on top of that, it might be a time to look for creative solutions.

The Third Way helps solve many immigrant issues by eliminating fraud and tweaking our broken immigrant tax system. If we do this, the model generates $40 billion to support educational programs over a 10 year period, and billions more to mitigate other immigrant related issues.

The new revised website is enduring tweaks of its own but The Third Way model for immigration website is: www.immigranttaxgroup.org
