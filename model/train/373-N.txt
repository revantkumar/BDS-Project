There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire ! from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers. Furthermore, OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. Though this administration might not care about SS for when you retire, but I sure do and the young adults following me. WE are trying to stop the "dumbing down" of the American people in our schools and STEM needs to stay and we need to employ our American people!
