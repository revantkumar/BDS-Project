I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of 
payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies 
to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their
F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not 
the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

It would be in the best interest of American Citizen workers and our Country for this rule to not be implemented.
