Gentlemen:
The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
The American people are fed up with the policies of a government bureaucracy that continually favors foreign students and illegal immigrants over its' American citizens. The people in Congress (a word by the way which means a large group of baboons), Bush and now Obama, have continually shown that special interest groups dictate the policies of our representatives even though they were elected to represent us and what was best for us. This is not happening. JFK once addressed Congress and said "if one of our Founding Fathers was here, he would be the only one with a brain!" You people between the Beltway better stop doing the "Washington Two Step" and start governing the way you are supposed to or......the people will revolt, and you are right on the verge of an upheaval in this Country. Would you want to guess who will be the objects of our wrath? Seriously contemplate this
