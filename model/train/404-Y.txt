It is unwise and short-sighted to repeal the OPT extention.

We DO NOT have enough qualified STEM workers in the US, otherwise, why so many companies are hiring international students rather than US citizens? The human resource cost of international students is much higher than US citizens because of their lowest wage level is higher than US citizen and applying H1B is also a high cost. Employers keep hiring international student with high cost reveals that we DO NOT have have sufficient local qualified STEM workers. There will be a big gap in STEM labor force if OPT extension ends.

Aborting OPT extension to force international STEM students leave the US is like a rising company layoff their backbone employees just because they are not their family. We all know that croynism can kill a wildly successful company, but why we haven't recognized that we are doing the same thing?
