I support the proposed rule of improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees and CapGap relief for All eligible F-1 students.

We all know that STEM is crucial to build a strong industrial America. We need the job to come back to America, to obtain that, we need a lot of STEM people to do the creative job to explore new fields of entrepreneurship, thus create job opportunities. OPT program is a way to train the STEM students for the future job, and a source to have fresh blood into the industry.
