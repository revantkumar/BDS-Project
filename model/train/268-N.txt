I oppose the expansion of the OPT Program on H-1B visas. Many companies are firing and/ or laying off many of their high skilled technical
workers and in some cases making them train their foreign replacements. This is outrageous. Then these foreign workers do
not leave after their visas expire, adding to our illegal alien problem.
