Isn't it enough what this President has done to destroy the American's dream for American who are the ones who pay his and all elected officials paychecks, every american is very fed up with the constant actions of going against Americans can someone put a stop to this communist attitude. As well as his constant attack of targeting seniors, the disabled and the veterans. What a shameful disgrace to our Flag, Country, language, and American Peoples White house .Stop taking care of those who do not belong, and start taking care of those who do belong for good. Americans Citizens come first in their country, and of those whom are elected by Americans do not and can not work for Americans , then they immediately need to be removed, and stopped from being paid by Americans tax dollars.
