A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

This plan makes sure that foreign-born graduates will take jobs that American college students need and it also exempts foreign-born employees from payroll taxes.

There are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.

Our citizens need protection for Social Security and Medicare!
