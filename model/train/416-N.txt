Let Americans from America have the benefits without reaching out to other countries for the jobs you are suppose to be promoting. We have enough people living off welfare that would be glad to earn a decent living to support their families.
We have needs for jobs paying more than welfare. Let our young people have pride in earning a job skill to make decent wages instead
of giving them away. We might just have to teach them to think for themselves instead of being handed the jobs. THINK positive for our young people.
