I think this STEM opt extension proposal is GREAT, for the following reasons. 
(i) STEM is crucial to the American economy and the American leadership in science and technology.
(ii) Currently, the American economy needs many workers with STEM expertise such as the technology and biology industries. There are not enough American citizens with STEM background, so allowing STEM international students to work longer after graduation is crucial to the economy. If some day international STEM students cannot work in the US any more, there won't be more Americans get employed; rather, fewer tech companies survive, which hurts the economy as well as the progress of humanity.
(iii) Allowing more international STEM students to work in the US can actually help create more jobs because of the growth of the tech industry and entrepreneurs from those students. Moreover, due to more competition and a more prosperous tech industry, more American citizens can become interested in STEM disciplines.

In conclusion, I think creating better policies for international STEM students is a win-win move.
