I am new graduate this year and working as data scientist in a growing tech company. I am the only one who knows data analysis in the company. I have to say I can help a lot for our team and company. 

Additionally, I had my undergraduate study in Canada and graduate study in US. There are two reasons I came to US for higher level education. First, the US is the largest nation in the world. The technology environment is the best all over the world. It is a dream land for STEM students. Second, although I had a job in Canada, I felt it would be a better career if I come to the US. The OPT extension for STEM student attracts me a lot. It means I could work in the US for at least 29 months and it is enough to obtain a working VISA.

Lastly, the new rule of OPT extension is a good new for us and the US. It will attract more and more international students come to the US and make the US the leading place in the tech world.
