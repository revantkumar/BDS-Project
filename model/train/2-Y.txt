We should support the OPT extension. The STEM-related industries are the major forces that keep America strong in this competitive world. Hiring the elite educated and trained from our advanced education systems is the most important reason why the US beats every other country in tech. Without the top talents in STEM industry, America will lose its position in science/technology for sure. We might even experience a greater recession after all the hard work to recover from 2008.
