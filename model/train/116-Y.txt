I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. I am an international student myself, and my opportunities in this country would increase a lot if I had the time after graduation to search for possible jobs where I could apply the knowledge I have gained in this country.
