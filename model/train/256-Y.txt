I strongest support the new rule for providing 24month OPT extension for STEM degree. This is one of the most justicial rules proposed since the establishment of USA for entire over 200 years. 

As an F-1 student, I just finish my PhD in STEM degree after 4.5yrs very hard working study. During my PhD, I need to usually work over 10hrs every day including whole weekends to finish my degree. No entertainment, no girlfriend, no movie, no TV, no soccer. Finally I got a job offer from a top tier company. Then, due to the huge mistake of USCIS (USCIS mistook me as another guy when I applied my OPT, this made me delay 2 moths to start my career), I didnt have a chance to apply H1B in this year. In September, when heard the OPT extension would possibly be revoked, I was totally shocked. I couldnt understand why this happened. The lawsuit from Washington labor organization is extremely discrimination, misleading and unfair for millions of international graduates in USA. I work with numerous worker everyday since Im an engineer. I DO NOT consider the job market issue for American worker is due to OPT and OPT extension at all. To the opposite, jus because of OPT, many high level international engineering talent can stay in the USA to maintain the competition ability globally and keep more opportunity for USA worker. Also, OPT is for relatively high degree level jobs. 99.99% of OPT graduate do not, will not and cannot steal the employment opportunity for USA local worker. The lawsuit from Washington labor organization lies to the whole country to grab unethical political benefits. 

In conclude, I urge USA government to PASS this 24month OPT extension for STEM degree ASAP. DO NOT wait!
