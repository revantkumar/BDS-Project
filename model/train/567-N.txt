Our economy is in the tank, and you propose to allow foreign students to take jobs that could be held by American graduates, this is absolutely unacceptable! I cannot believe that we do not have the young people that are qualified to fill these jobs. Perhaps they could take these jobs instead of living in their parents basements and drawing unemployment benefits. Then perhaps they could pay back their student loans, rather than demonstrating against the capitalist system which allows all to achieve according to their abilities.

If in fact we don't have, graduates that are qualified, then perhaps the funds that will give incentives to business' to hire foreign students could better be used to improve our educational system, so we can compete with the rest of the world. in fact, our young people should be given a quality education before we recruit from other countries. I am definitely opposed to creating an environment that discriminates against Americans in favor of those who are not. 

Please reconsider this misguided legislation. thank you for your consideration.
