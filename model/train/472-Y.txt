This decision is very good. The law should be consistent and fair, or it will just be some small party's toy. International students are very important to US' economics and they don't steal jobs from US citizen. Roughly change the law, the demand for labor won't be met for long time and this only leads to worse economics and less hiring. This is no good to anyone, including the people who are objecting this law.
