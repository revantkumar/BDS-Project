When flying, we are told to "put on your own oxygen mask before helping others", so we CAN help others. Americans are the most generous of people, and when in need we help others. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE AWAY FROM US THE ABILITY TO DO SO. 

Immigration into the US is destroying our people and our financial base because Americans can't get jobs. We can help others most by helping them build their infrastructure, and housing and clean water through the many improved technologies available to us now. Housing, such as the CalEarth Institute shows us the way to provide for others AS WELL AS OURSELVES without destroying the greatest country ever to be created. 

Let's help others by teaching them to fish, not inviting them into our home and feeding them a fish every day. We need to help all people become independent. 

This will not happen if we tear down the US. We are the light and the example to most of the planet, PLEASE KEEP IT THAT WAY.
