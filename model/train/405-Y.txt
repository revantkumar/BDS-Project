I definitely support this proposal. My reasons are threefold.

First of all, Every one has freedom to pursue a better future. International students also have their rights to find an opportunity to show their talents. 

Second, international students can only apply for jobs in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal. Americans don't need to worry about work opportunities. 

Third, it is diversity that makes America becomes a freedom and equality country.
