OPT denies hundreds of thousands of Americans rightful jobs.

OPT has robbed Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds which Seniors in this country to survive on.

This has got to be stopped immediately. The American people are demanding that you in Washington do what you were sent there to do - that is, to submit to the will of the people who elected you and above all protect our interests.
OPT, in no way, does either.
