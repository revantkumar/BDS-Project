I strongly support the proposal because I think the government should create more time and opportunities for students who have learned highly technical knowledge from US institutions (STEM) to apply and contribute to US companies and economy. Secondarily, I strongly believe that diversity is beneficial to US as a country. Last but not the least, this proporsal is creating competition in US labor market, which is indeed what the country needs. People are motivated by competition to work harder, learn more, and improve. This country is moving forward because of the more dedicated people.
