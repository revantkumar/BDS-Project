how could US be so powerful for the passed decades of years? How could US lead the revolution of information technology? How could US ensure that she will lead this century and next? From the first immigrants from Europe, to those from Africa, now for those from all over world, they built the US to its strong shape today. It is the creative and smart and hardworking people from all over the world help US build what it is today. Considering how could Elon Mask be kept from US if he has no right to stay in US? There will be no Tesla, no Falcon, no Solar tech. Technology helps US to empower on the earth. Extended OPT will not only help international students to gain helpful experience, but also helps US find the most excellent talent to make her lead for this century! 
Yes, a good OPT is a win win choice for both sides!
