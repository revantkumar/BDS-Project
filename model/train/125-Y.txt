I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

We are living in the time of economic globalization, when a successful company needs to think globally. OPT could help companies in the US employ students in different cultures, which could give them different type of thinking. With only one-year OPT, however, most of the foreign students will only have time to adapt to the new working environment. They do not have time to help the company develop new ideas. So the new OPT extension rule is needed for US companies to think bigger.

Meanwhile, this new policy could promote healthy competition between people in different cultures. In this way, not only do American people, but also foreigners could have a better motivation to become a better person in skills, which is a good thing for the country and the companies. It's really a win-win!
