It is incredible that this government would choose to favor a few individuals and corporations who wish to discriminate against fellow citizens in their hiring practises. Adding to this insult against fellow citizens is the very real danger that the foreign workers being sought after have no true affection for our Republican form of self-governence. This can become a very risky endeavor,indeed! 

Congradulations for turning your backs on the very issues which you CLAIM to espouse. So much for "helping the middle-class" when, in fact, at the drop of a hat you will "Step n Fetch" to whatever your favorite crony capitalists tell you to do!

Thanks again!
