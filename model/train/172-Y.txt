I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposed OPT regulation, this HAS TO be approved!

1. US high education tops the world, because of this. Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. What makes US high education different? What make sure that US can attract more students than other Countries? The answer is OPT. OPT can guarantee graduated student gain sufficient skills from the best industry in US. This is what makes international students choose US high education instead of others. The entire US education benefit from this.

2. It helps, NOT hurts, the job market. We all know that international students have huge contribution to many important tech innovations happened in US. Talents from all over the world create the proliferation of today's industry, especially technology companies, including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and all others. This in turns brings a better job market in all related area. Think about it, without them, these companies will have far less excellent candidates, and we will fall short of smart people to create the next Google, next social network, next wonderful app running on our mobile phones. This hurts the entire job market and reduces the total number of job opportunities. This is a disaster for not only foreigners, but most importantly, for the US citizen themselves. 

3. THIS IS PART OF THE PROMISE MADE BY UNIVERSITIES. International students choose pursuing degrees from US because the university promises to offer the best education, where one of the most important service items is OPT! Breaking this promise damages the good reputation of the entire US education.
