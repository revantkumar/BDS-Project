I am totally appalled by these actions. The government should be promoting the US citizens whom are I need of vast education. Why in God's name would we support the education of other countries. We need to focus on the US not on foreign countries. Charity needs to begin at home not abroad. It is our tax dollars that are used fro all this B.S. and I am against it completely. We as taxpayers need to stand together to let the government know where our tax dollars are spent. It is not up to them to just do as they please. They were put in office to work for us not for themselves. If any of them feel that they can just keep doing this without our approval they are 100% WRONG.
