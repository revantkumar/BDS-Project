Students with STEM Degrees have great knowledge and skill to help development of both science, industry and economy. However, due to cutthroat competition in job market, nonimmigrant students have much less chance to find a job if they only have a little time to stay in US after graduation. As a result, so many excellent students have to leave. It is a lost to both students and companies. To solve this problem, expending training opportunities is a nice wayit could both improve student's passion to study STEM subjects and also elevate the quality of staff in companies.
