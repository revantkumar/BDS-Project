I definitely support STEM OPT extension. This will provide the students to get exposed to the real world working culture and will help them gain real time knowledge. Skilled international students can contribute to US, all they need is a chance to do so. Some Americans complained about this extension could take away job opportunities for American but as long as they follow all the conditions in STEM OPT extension, it should not be a problem.
