I am fully in support of this extension and feel it is a good idea. I think it will help the US become more competitive when it comes to Science/Technology students entering the workforce, and will allow these students to be much more prepared for their full time careers.

While schooling helps prepare people a great deal, real-world experience helps infinitely more and such experience is indispensible in your future career!
