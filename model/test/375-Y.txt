Opt stem is so important. In the current USA, the food industry is in short of food science professional labor. A large amount of food workers in the industry and academics are international laboratory. If opt get shortened or canceled, there is no doubt USA food industry would suffer a long term dis dynamic. I think this would happen in other fields as well.
