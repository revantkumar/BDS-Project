There is no doubt the US government should expanding OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students for the following reasons.

First, the government should let the students with STEM degrees to make contributions to US. To increase economic of US, we need not only investment, but also a great amount of technical professionals. The STEM students learnt science and technology in US, it would be stupid to let them go back to India, China, or other countries. High-tech technicians are the most important resource to economic development. The reason why US still holds advantages in fields of science, engineering, education is that it still has the best talents.

On the other hand, competition between international students and residents is not as severe as most people think. Most of STEM relative fields provide enough work positions and are in shortage of talents supply. They can't find enough appropriate American residents, so more international graduates with STEM degrees should be encouraged to work in these technical fields to keep the competitive advantage of US over other countries and regions.
