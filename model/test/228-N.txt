I am opposed to allowing foreign nationals extended stays beyond their college graduation dates. I work in a scientific field and I see the advantage that these foreign nationals are given when they are given first opportunity at available high tech jobs. They fill OEO quotas for high tech companies and discourage American citizens from applying. Several of the terrorists that attacked the World Trade Center on 9/11 were here on overstays of student Visas. Our immigration system is broken. Going around Congress with yet another Executive Order does not assist in fixing the broken immigration system. We are a country of laws and the Congress makes the laws, not the President.
