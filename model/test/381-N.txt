I do not agree with this new rule by ICEB for OPT F-1 students (or in actuality soon to be former) university and college non-immigrant students. It is the American citizen who has to pay the bill for these students to live here and get Healthcare or whatever while they are here. But most of all this bill is anti-American because it says American students are not worth the government's time to protect and that the American student doesn't deserve the same privileges as all the other nationalities of the world. Immigrants from every and any other country can get this benefit but not our own? And furthermore there is not enough specific language to keep the companies from getting rid of American workers just so they can get cheap labor. The time we already have for these students is way too much anyway when we don't even keep track of where they are to make sure the student goes back home. I like people and i don't mind helping the underprivileged but when it is to the detriment of others then it is wrong. And truthfully who is to say that these students aren't being helped to stay here and disappear from government sight just so they can help America enemies and pretend they are students. Or use their skills to harm America. But whatever their reason for staying. It harms other people and is an unfair advantage over those who live here and still don't have the money for the education and training that will be handed to other people on "a golden platter" so to speak. Especially when it specifically denies them this privilege. I don't want this to become law in any form.
