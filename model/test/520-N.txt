Our government should be training our own citizens before expanding or even starting to train nonimmigrant students even with STEM degrees. That is why our country is going down hill in sciences and productivity. We simply don't have enough properly trained people to do the jobs. Education and job training costs so much that these poor young people are saddled with so much debt that they will never be able to get out of the hole. Charity and help begins at home. Do the right thing. For the next generation and for our country. Thank you.
