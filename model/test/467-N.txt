It has been documented by several well known centers that there is no shortage of STEM workers in the U.S. If it were true, wages would be increasing but they are either stagnant or decreasing. Many STEM grads are not even working in their field due to lack of jobs or being out of the labor force completely. The workers at Disney who were forced to train their foreign replacements now have to find jobs elsewhere, not an easy task these days,regardless of the settlement they received, in reality a Disney buy off. Under OPT, companies hiring F-1 foreign students instead of hiring U.S. graduates, save 7.65% because they don't have to pay FICA or Medicare taxes, costing Social Security $1 billion a year. The company also receives a bonus for hiring F-1 alien graduates rather than American graduates with the same skills. Another buy off? It is very obvious that money is behind this whole scheme. This proposed ruling is irresponsible and dangerous as reported by the GAO, who claims the department has no method to track the tens of thousands of foreign students living and working in this country and ICE cannot fully ensure those working under OPT are maintaining their legal status. The GAO also reported the program is full of inefficiencies and susceptibility to fraud with little oversight by the Department. Also, the OPT program is not available for American graduates, clearly a form of discrimination. This ruling is a form of preferential treatment for aliens who are stealing American jobs. Companies who hire alien graduates instead of American graduates, should be fined rather than rewarded with a bonus. This ruling is an insult to every American. Many of these foreign students should be returned to their homes to work for the advancement of their country.
I am against this ruling as it harms America and the American worker.
