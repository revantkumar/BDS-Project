I don't disagree with the arguments that the citizens of the same country should get jobs first. That's very correct from a communist perspective. However, who are really the native citizens of US? What made US one of the most developed nations of today? Was that really because of the native population living here before Columbus? Well, the immigration system of today (especially the OPT and STEM extension) acts as a filter to extract the smart people from around the world while blocking the less smart/ less hardworking ones. Since the population of US is only around 5% of the total population of the world, it's much more likely to find smart people from outside of US than inside. But their native countries don't give them enough support and opportunities and they are just a minority there without much voice in the politics (so, many of them "migrate in search of better pastures" to US or to other countries). Another fact is that STEM extension actually encourages more and more competition in those fields which directly result in the country's progress. Doesn't that also make native Americans more competitive because they now have to work harder to deal with the competition from outside? How is giving a job to a more capable/ hardworking foreigner viewed as "stealing" from the Americans? (when in fact, Americans get equal or even more advantages because of being born in the US, having no visa rejections, no strict OPT deadlines, less tuition, no language barriers etc.?). Many people also ignore the fact that many of these foreigners work really hard and create lot more jobs and more advancements in the technology (there are even CEO's and Nobel Laureates among the immigrants).
