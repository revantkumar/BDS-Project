I am opposed to this legislation, and glad that it is non-partisan, since I am an Independent voter. I spent my entire career in the tech industry, but am now disabled and paralyzed. I've hired and worked with foreign workers and witnessed many out-sourcing situations that cost American workers their jobs. It is a myth that the foreign workers were any better,albeit cheaper. but, you get what you pay for.
