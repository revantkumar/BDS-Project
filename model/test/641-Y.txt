I strongly support this new rule, which would bring more benefits to USA.
1. This would be an effective step to attract talented international students, considering other countries like Canada, Australia conducting similar appealing policies. The 24-month extension would make american academic institution more competitive in attracting qualified students.
2. Usually, valuable researches would take much longer than 12 months. It would hurt if international students are forced to leave and interrupt those programs because of the ending of the OPT. I'm working on risk modeling now, and the recently completed one took more than one and half year. The 12 months are far less than enough even for one project!
3. OPT students do not necessarily lower the local salary. As far as I know, I have the same compensation as local citizens with the same title in the group.
