I'm a international STEM student who recently graduated. It's hard for me to find a job in the US if I can only have one year OPT because 1 year is not enough for any projects in the industry. The employers won't hire someone who needs to leave at the middle of your work. It's unfair for us. We need more time practice and get experienced.
