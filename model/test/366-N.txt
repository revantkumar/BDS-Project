Quit favoring yourselves (OUR "representatives")and favor the American workforce. Illegals and even legal immigrants should NEVER be given priority over our families that have lived here all our lives (and my family has been here since BEFORE the American Revolution). Remember: your children, grandchildren, all citizens in the U. S. A. have to live by your rulings! What are you doing to them???!!!
