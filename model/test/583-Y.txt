I totally agree to expand the OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months. The reason is simple. In this way, the high-tech companies can get employees much easier, which is definitely helpful for the development of United States. With the longer period of The OPT visa, employees do not need to rush for the H1-B visa. Comparing OPT with H1-B, the second one will make more burden for the immigration issue. So on the other side, extending OPT can also reduce the immigration burden for sure.
