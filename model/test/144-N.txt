In the past I have always thought that businesses we most of the time right in their actions to hire qualified workers. Now that our country is in such financial a situation as it is, I think it may be time to think about saving our country and not allowing more power to be placed in the hands of corporations that are only interested in the bottom line. I would like to see the DHS stand up for America and Americans for a change. Please do not relax the rules to get businesses more incentives to put more Americans out of work.
