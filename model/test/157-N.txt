I am opposed to extending the visas of foreign workers in the United States. These are people who would possibly already be here illegally. Enough is enough. America has been degraded with foreigners over the past decade with no serious end to it from your sorry policies and failures to protect our borders, Mr. Obama. Millions of US citizens like me share the same opinion. I know an elitist - top down command and control leftist like yourself hates most of us in this country so its a way of you getting even with us through your callous disregard for our sovereignty. You will probably be remembered as one of the US worst presidents. Perhaps you might want to reverse the trend for a while by shelving this assault on American workers and our liberty.
