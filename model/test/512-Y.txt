As an international student, coming to US to experience the education system here is really attractive, because we were told how different that American way is, how diverse and creative. I appreciated that I learned a lot not only the knowledge but also culture here, somehow, two years study in school and about one year OPT with native coworkers can't allow us to know deeper about US, to know the differences between our home country and US, the people here, the way they solve problems, and why all these are different. I always think that US open that door for foreign students to come to study is base on the good desire to share only the knowledge but more important the culture, to let the world be more friendly to each other, and the friendship is always built on younger generation, who are more active, creative, brave, energetic and not stubborn.
