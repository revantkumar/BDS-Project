The new Rule makes it really useful for the students who came here to get the quality education and get some hands on on the things they have learnt. The students should get some practical exposure of the skills they have developed as a part of their academics which not only helps themselves but also for the growth of the company. As all the students from various origins come here for education, the company can get variety of knowledge from different kinds of students which can make overall growth of the company in an exponential way. So, I support the new rule and hope it stays in future.

All the best.
