I strongly support the OPT extension not only for international students' but also for US citizens' benefit. Extension will help US startups have more less expensive high-level technical support. Extension only helps the skilled international students have more TIME to get a job. BUT extension doesn't give any direct advantage to international students in their job interview or resume.
