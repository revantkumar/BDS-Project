I strongly support this proposal and believe that this will be beneficial to the technological development of United States of America. Several reasons below may explain my thought.
1 International students are making a great contribution to this country after their graduation, using knowledge to benefit many fields of society.
2 Without STEM and CapGap Relief, many students would have to come back to their original countries right after graduation, which will be a loss to U.S. and companies.
3 The extension of STEM and CapGap Relief won't take over job opportunities of native americans since those job positions can't find appropriate native, and I believe that competition does exist but it will be overall good for the whole society to keep improving and innovating.
