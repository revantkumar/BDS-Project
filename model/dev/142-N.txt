Foreign students should have to sign up for a new visa every year. They should not be able to continue in the school systems if their visas have expired. They also should not have preference over this countries students in our universities. My grandson is having a hard time finding a scholarship to play golf next year at a D1 school, because many school systems take foreign students first. They make more money. Our children are now being treated as aliens and not citizens. This must stop. Our schools are in business now to make money, instead of education. Please control the visas not only for our children; but also for our countries safety. This country needs to start putting our citizens above other country's. We are the ones who pay taxes and we should benefit from those taxes not be penalized.
