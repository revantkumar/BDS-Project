I oppose the DHS's proposed rule that would extend the OPT program. This extension would incentivize U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. In addition, it would violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates and many experienced STEM workers struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
