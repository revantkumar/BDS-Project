Completely support! A lot of foreign students learn and work harder. And without extension, one year OPT, I feel, usually is not long enough for an engineering student to gain enough experience. Since junior engineers are often defined as 2-3 years experience, the stem program allows those students become a junior engineer instead of an entry level when they go back to their own country after finishing the program.
