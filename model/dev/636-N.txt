The F-1 VISA program is a sham! It is used to bring (or keep) foreign students here for far less money. American students (of any race) would enter science and engineering at about $60-80K per year. Good workers, after 5 years, would earn $130K or more. That is what an engineer or staff scientist would make, more with more experience. 

Foreign workers are being brought here, or F-1 VISA holders allowed to take jobs, for $40-60K per year, even less. Some of these people live 6-10 per rented house, because they cannot afford rent in the Bay Area. Then, when they get permanent residency, they ask for American salaries and are laid-off. If they complain about the pay, the company holds the F-1 VISA over their heads. Think I'm making it up, sit outside ANY building of Cisco Systems and see who goes through the door. More than 80% of them are Indian (NOT American Indian.) And at least 50% of them will take the bus. Don't ask the company for diversity info (they classify Indians as Caucasians, which they are), just sit outside at starting time.

If we are going to make America Great Again, we have to employ Americans first. If a company wants to employ Indians, or Red Chinese or Russians, open a office there. But don't flood the land with immigrants for the sake of low wages. And then these people wind up on the unemployment rolls or in lower paying jobs when they get residency because they won't work for a bag a rice.

And if you think I'm just some idiot speaking plainly (as Lee Iaccoca suggested) I have worked in tech and semiconductors for 33 years, have over 10 patents (that I know of) have started companies, have seen two IPOs, and helped design the Atari 5200 Super System. I was educated at the University of California (the finest in the land!) in Physics and know my stuff.

Make America Great Again!
