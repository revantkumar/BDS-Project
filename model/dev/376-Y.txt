I surpport this opt 24 months extension. US are lacking of stem related people with higher education degree. IT companies grow bigger and bigger these years and hire aggressively but they cannot get people with the high requirements because sometimes great candidates don't have valid work authorization. I strongly surpport this extension for this case.
