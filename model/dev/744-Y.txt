I am a master student majored in computational finance. When I apply for foreign master program, OPT and the extension are one of the most important reasons that I choose to study in US. That's why I decline the scholarship from Spain and other countries and pay the tuition all on my own to study in US.

It would be a disaster for students like me and other students who want to apply for similar program. The first 2 or 3 years of working experience after graduation is the most valuable one. If we can only work here for 1 year, those programs would much less attractive to us. What we want is not finding ways to stay in US, but learn from it, contribute to it and return to our home country.

In addition, what we do here is just help the US economy. We spend the money our family earned back in our home country, and we pay our own tuition, rent for house, eat, do shopping. All of these would help the employment and internal demand of US.
