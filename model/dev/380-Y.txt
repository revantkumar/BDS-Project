I strongly support this Stem OPT regulation.
First, it provides those who come to the United States for high education and try to find a job here. In the perspective of education system in the US, this regulation will attract eminent students all over the world and bring the prosperity of US. From the government perspective, this regulation will help US to be a country with multi-national and thus contribute to the economics. Third but not last, this regulation will provide US companies with abundant work force, which is desirable and of course beneficial to the government as well. 
So in a conclusion, I think US should have this regulation pass.
