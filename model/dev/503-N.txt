I am appalled that President Obama is serious about this OPT enhancement. Why would our President want to make life more difficult for the American unemployed than he already has? The terms of this program do nothing positive for the American people. As a matter of fact they actually hurt Americans. To give foreign workers a better chance at getting a job than American citizens is an affront to the American people and an inappropriate act for any President. What is even worse is that they are exempt from Social Security and Medicare deductions!!! How absurd!!!! This action on his part will increase the number of Americans being laid off in deference for cheaper foreign labor. Lets take a look at what harm the current program has already done: 
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
It is amazing how this new program is basically against the law, not to mention common sense: 
the proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination."
"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit."
What is wrong with this picture. This cannot be allowed to happen. I want my daughters, both college graduates, to be able to get good jobs, not what they have currently. It is disgusting that our government is wantonly disregarding the welfare of its people, and what for, corporate profits!!!! This program will go a long way to putting America further in debt, one which we already appear to be unable to address. This enhancement must be stopped!!!!!!
