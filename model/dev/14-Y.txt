I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.
2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area. STEM OPT has corresponding regulations to PROTECT US workers on their job security and competitiveness in the market, therefore STEM OPT rule DOES NOT put advantages over US citizens!
3. It's beneficial for the US academic sector because longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
