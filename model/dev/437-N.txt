THIS RULE FURTHER MAKES IT HARDER FOR AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY RECENT GRADS, TO FIND WORK WHEN THE EMPLOYERS CAN HIRE FOREIGNERS AT A LOWER PAY RATE. THIS ALSO REDUCES THE BURDEN ON AMERICAN COMPLANIES TO PAY PAYROLL TAXES ON A LOWER WAGE. THE RULE SHOULD STAY THE WAY IT IS AND IF THE FOREIGNERS DON'T LIKE IT LET THEM GO HOME TO WORK AND BE TAXED AT WHATEVER RATE THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY CHARGES. LET AMERCIANS WORK AT AMERICAN JOBS. ENOUGH JOBS HAVE ALREADY GONE OVERSEASE. IT'S TIME AMERICAN JOBS STAY HERE IN THE USA AND WORKED BY AMERICANS. MANY OF THE FOREIGN WORKERS WILL VIOLATE THEIR STAY AND IGNORE THE TIME TO LEAVE FOR HOME SO THEY CAN STAY HERE.
