I am asking Homeland Security why we are not limiting or stoping immigration, until all non immigrant students are properly trained and working. 
I demand we take care of our own first. Stop the illegal students that abuse their visas from taking native born American college student jobs. 
American born students are our future and should be treated as so. 
Cap-gap Relief for F-1 students.
I can't believe what is being done, to our college graduates.OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. What is going on? The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S? Employers use it to get around the H-1B cap. 

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. 
Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.
OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65% when they hire foreign students instead of US workers. They don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range? While costing Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. Stop this asinine practice and place Americans first. Social Security is bankrupt we need workers to fund it for American born retirees.

The proposed rule is open to every and all the world dregs to come here and take advantage of the American Tax payers hospitality. This Rule does not take into account the intelligence of the applicant or what the applicant can provide to our nation monetarily. By that I mean can the foreign student has the ability to support themselves while attending school. Without taking advantage of the American tax payer.
This is unbelievable that we have left this continue while Americans are suffering. Allowing corporations to take advantage of a loophole that is detrimental to the American people should be closed.

The F1 nonimmigrant classification is available to certain academic students seeking temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or in an accredited language training program. 
In short, every and any school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any who wants to come to the U.S. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 911 terrorist would have qualified under this broad definition..I'm fuming to learn while OPT is a form of temporary employment lasting 48 months,which is no-ones definition of temporary. Since the whole college experience begins and ends in 48 months. 
The OPT program is a school unto itself 48 months is the course of study. A student can apply to engage in OPT during their academic program. This is known as pre-completion OPT, 
As admitted in this Regulation and in the Immigration Code this regulation assists the foreign student to change status to H1B.
Thus eligible to replace a qualified US worker WITHOUT A DEGREE OR EXPERIENCE. or after completing the academic program, known as post-completion OPT. As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. 
Clearly, this regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end run around existing laws. It's an employment program for and only for foreign students This is unbelievable.
(U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.}

Safe guards must be implemented to protect the American Worker now!!!

AMERICA FOR AMERICANS FIRST!!

EMPLOYERS MUST SET UP MENTORING OR CO-OP PROGRAMS WITH LARGER PERCENTAGE OF US STUDENTS THAN FOREIGN BORN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM.

Homeland Security lacks the resources to track these students after their visas expires. Is the FBI capable of doing the background checks for all applicants? These are important issues that are not considered under these Regulations.
