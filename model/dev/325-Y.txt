OPT is something that international students greatly desire after graduation. In my experience as a DSO, students want that experience to make them more competitive for jobs in their home countries as well as to learn the best practices in their chosen field. Knowing how OPT is such a fundamental part of many students' experience in the US, I firmly believe that extending the program for STEM majors would entice even more students to choose the US over our competitors for foreign students.

In turn, being a more attractive place for foreign students would bring more money and cultural diversity into the country. Denying F-1 students the chance to work after graduation would cost us all the economic and cultural rewards that we would otherwise have.
