I definitely support this proposed rule, because US is allowing more F-1 students to enter US to study and work here. And as most of us have known, that foreign students with a STEM degree have taken up very high percentage of the technical work force in US today. In another word, the foreign students are actually contributing to the economic improvement and creating more working opportunities. If the rule is denied, most of the technical and financial service industry will suffer from a big loss of talents, maybe even not be able to hold in the competitive market. 

US is a nation of different colors and races who all contribute to the country, so the working opportunities especially from STEM majors are pushing the country forward as we all witness today. I really hope this rule could be approved, and surely in that way, the government is making a good decision for both foreign students and its prosperous future. 

Thanks!
