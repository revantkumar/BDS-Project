This is a great proposal that will for sure will America keep the best STEM talents and help us maintain the advantages when it comes to technologies, innovations, math, science and engineering.

It even gives me the imagination to see a similar proposal that might apply to other talents in non STEM fields. Out universities also train the best, for example, financial talents and the greatest artists. I look forward to seeing more proposals like this that will help us attract and keep talents, and help America be great, and be America!
