After studying in one of the best universities in the world best platform for them would the OPT which will help them to implement their learning and understand market and industry demands better because nothing can suffice the practical knowledge gain on the other hand the US industry will be benefited with the great minds at work which directly will help the US economy to grow .

This clearly helps the US economy to grow and learning experience for the students which help them understand properly what they studied.
