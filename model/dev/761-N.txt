I STRONGLY PROTEST THE DEPT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S PROPOSED RULE THAT WOULD EXPAND THE OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING PROGRAM. IT IS AN OUTRAGE WHAT IT WILL TO OUR WORKERS AND OUR
SOCIAL SECURITY FUND!!! WHAT KIND OF HOMELAND SECURITY IS THAT???? THE MEMBERS SHOULD BE RUN
OUT OF OFFICE AND SEE HOW THEY LIKE HAVING NO JOB OR INCOME.
