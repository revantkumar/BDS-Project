State governments are going all out to encourage high school grads to apply for STEM programs in college and raise the level of math and science. Don't let the federal government discourage these students by giving the job opportunities to F-1 Students that will work for less here in the US. Having been involved with these programs in my previous career, I know it does not take long before the F-1 Students start using their leverage to raise their salary demands.
