I think this is extremely important for us.

I'm a Master student graduated in last Dec.

Most of us pay for the expensive tuition for the University in US, aiming the money back after we graduation by continue working in US.

However, if stop OPT STEM immediately, it is like we pay the money and didn't get the chance it work. Even if our employer already think we are qualified employee.

That's unfair.
