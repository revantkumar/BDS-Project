I strongly agree with this proposed rule! The original reason of why I choose to have my graduate study here in the US, rather than UK or other countries, is that we can have 17 or more extend opt time. But if the opt time is shortened, I'm sure that there will be less attractiveness for the future students to apply to study here. So I'm strongly agree with this new rule to improve and expand OPT. Thanks!
