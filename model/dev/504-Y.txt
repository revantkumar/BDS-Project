I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. 

I went through several interesting comments and am feeling curious how many percentage of people who said NO to this proposal are working in STEM area. If not, please don't say STEM students are taking your job opportunities and don't say they let you be unemployed. We're all foreigners to this continent. This country is built on immigration. Where you find your privilege to say no to foreign students of today?
