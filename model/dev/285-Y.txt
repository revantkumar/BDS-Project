Labor resources in a country works like a genetic pool of a eco-system, the more diversified it is, the higher possibility it may ends up with the good combination of right person in right position, hence maximizing the efficiency of the society. It also works like a market, introducing free competition is very likely to stimulate students to strengthen their skill portfolio, and companies to put their best effort to create new jobs.

Shutting down doors for F-1 students to work in US may make some people happy for a while, because they can find a job with less effort. But this is essentially rewarding laziness, and punishing international students for contributing to US economic development(Most F-1 visa holders are elite students in their own countries). 

So why pushing those elite international students to the potential competitors of US companies after spending tremendous amount of education resources on them? Just give them a chance to settle down in this country and let them shine.
