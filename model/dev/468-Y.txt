I highly agree to this proposal. This would definitely help keep more international students have much more opportunity to stay in the United States to keep studying from the community, which could be helpful for both the United States but also be helpful for other countries. International students are the best group who understand the culture both in their home country but also the United States. This proposal is just the action to help them for this. Also in comparison with other countries, like Japan, Canada, almost all developed countries have the policy to support international student to keep staying there to have more communication with their home countries.
