I support the expansion of the Optional Practical Training proposed by the Dept of Homeland Security. 

The US's leading status in science and technology is built together by a strong international team of researchers. If it becomes difficult for international students to stay in US, it will tremendously hurt the future of both frontiers, while providing other countries the opportunity to get these talents and to catch-up. If this regulation, and more generally a better immigration system cannot be in place in the near future, US will recede from the No.1 position in science and technology in a few decades.
