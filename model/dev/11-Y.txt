I strongly SUPPORT new OPT policy.

To begin with, foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX and they help the economy of USA. New OPT policies will attract more international students to study in USA, which will directly benefits the development of American universities. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge loss.

What's more, here is no guarantee how long it will take and how much it will cost to train all US students to fully compensate loss of foreign students. Without this policy, numerous companies in the United States will face serious shortage of STEM workers and tremendous loss.

Therefore, I highly SUPPORT this new policy and really hope this could be APPROVED!!!!.
