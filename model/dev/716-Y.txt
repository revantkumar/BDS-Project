I definitely support the improving and expanding OPT for F1 student with STEM degrees.

Firstly ,OPT extension can bring more international student to study in USA , who will bring a huge amount of income for USA education , such as more expense on live , tuition fee, car cost and transportation. All of these will be a huge income for many of public university, and with these income the University can devote more into researching, reduce local American student's fee, and also recruit best professor to improve the education. Thinking about in university, the major in mathematics , engineering or computer science, you will find almost 85% student in these majors come from outside of USA. In other words, if OPT extension is cut off, maybe this will lead about 50% budget reduction in these majors'incomes. Without these budget, maybe you will find these major course will become a really small course , just 5 or 6 students here.

Secondly, as we all know that the STEM degrees stand for the major in mathematics , engineering , science and some basic researching major in university which are the foundation of technology and technology applications in our life. In NASA, and Corporations in Silicon Valley , the international employees are huge part of power in here. If you cut off these, corporations may not find employees who are good at mathematics ,engineering and computer science, that means high salary rate , lower productivity and even move the company outside to other countries. Because they cannot find the residents who hold STEM degrees in local. Business really need such human resource to power the technology in USA. And these international workforce of course will not take the opportunities from local people, even local people always want to take majors in literature , psychology. 

Thirdly,the reason that USA is powerful in the world is that diversity brings energy , innovations to this country. Meanwhile, with equal law this country progress into a new stage in the world. Why should we stop this road into top ?
