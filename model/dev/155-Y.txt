I think international students especially STEM major students should have the extended opt to have a job after they graduate. This will not only ensure the economy well being considering the large number of international students each year but also ensure the stability of the society. If the opt extension were to be cancelled, then there would be less and less students to come to ameirica for higher education. This directly will result a bad economy. Also America want to keep those talents here for advancing technology, how to keep them here if we don't give them time to work here?
