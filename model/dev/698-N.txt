As a two overseas tour military veteran I am more than outraged that the USA federal government is spitting upon the citizens of our once-sovereign country. I read and hear a growing number of military veterans and others considering the need of a Revolutionary War Two to oust the tyrants infesting the federal government and other parts of the USA. 

Keep spitting upon We, the People and do not be surprised if our accumulated outrage leads to what the Founders wrote what a free people need to do when confronted by tyranny.
