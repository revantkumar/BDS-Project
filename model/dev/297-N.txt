The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned. Today, however, it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and for US employers to get around the H-1B cap. The DHS proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.

In addition, there are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. This gives US employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers and subsequently undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers (aka future US tax payers).

Finally, OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American (US citizen) competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

Why, pray tell, would DHS want to change a rule that directly hurts legal citizens of the United States? This proposed rule makes no sense with an economy tittering on the verge of an recession, high unemployment and the lowest labor participation rate in several decades?
