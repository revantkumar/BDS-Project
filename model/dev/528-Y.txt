At the heart of this issue is obviously protecting Americans, their wages and jobs. I applaud Washington Tech for standing up against depressed wages. I truly wish that more lawsuits would occur involving unpaid interns. So many employers want free labor and students engage in this work to gain the experience to be competitive in the market place. The trouble is that employers get a taste for free labor and they want more. This is what is truly driving down wages and new hiring for everyone. There should be enforced limits on unpaid internships and employers should be held accountable. 

With regard to international students, it is extremely important to remember the value that these individuals and their families bring to our country and our economy. First and foremost, is their work ethic, drive and creativity. The ones that make it here are living their dreams to study and work in the land of opportunity. Generally speaking, they are some of the top students you'll find within US universities. This is certainly the case at our school. Secondly, is their contribution to the cultural richness and diversity that makes the US such an incredible nation. These students engage with domestic students and everyone benefits overall from improved communication and cultural skills helpful in the global workforce. 

And then there is the financial benefit to having international students here: According to NAFSA findings, during the 2013-2014 academic year, "the 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy." "This is a 8.5% increase in job support and creation, and a nearly 12% increase in dollars contributed to the economy from the previous academic year." You can see more about this study here:

As a former DSO and current career adviser for a university with roughly 3,000 international students and 11,000 domestic students, I have seen both the cumbersome paperwork DSO's must already handle daily as well as the way employers shy away from international students due to a lack of understanding about existing work authorization opportunities for F-1 students. Many of our employer partners already state they won't consider internationals, PERIOD. It is really unfair for US universities to attract international students (they all pay full-tuition and cannot take out US loans) under the notion that they will have the opportunity to gain US work experience when we know that employers increasingly won't consider them. 

While the new proposed wage protections are good for all workers, the training plans and 6 month check-ins are too cumbersome for most any employer to consider. There is also too cumbersome a burden on DSO's who usually don't have expertise on fields of study or constantly changing academic subjects. They aren't going to have enough knowledge about programs of study to be in a position to approve these plans. 

As a final note, I'll state that we will be driving international students back to take roles outside of the US where more American jobs will be outsourced. If the talent is abroad and it's cheaper there, employers will still hire these folks, only it will be in a place where we have no control over wage standards. With today's technology, the work can be done anywhere. Don't we want to keep the top minds that we are training here in the U.S. where they continue to drive our economy? These are consumers, tax payers and top minds we are sending away when we include too many burdens on would-be employers who need these workers' talents.
