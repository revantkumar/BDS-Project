I agree with this policy as it is only for STEM Degrees, which most of the Americans are not taken. The international students provide a lot of money to American educations, and the jobs for STEM are often more hard and with less pay. Why not give them a chance to work for US companies to earn money from the other countries? Besides, notice that the high paid jobs in business, financial, consultant are almost U.S. citizen only. So I think we don't need to worry about this.
