I think the new 24 month OPT extension is a great idea for the U.S. economy. Tech companies need a great number of STEM majors to fill their need for coders and quantitative researchers, and without the new extension policies the U.S. trained engineers, mathematicians, and future scientists will return to their home countries and likely will become the industrial and academic leaders there. Having them competing against the U.S. in the future is not a wise move on the U.S. side. The new extension program will help avoid that competition and thereby greatly benefit American economy.
