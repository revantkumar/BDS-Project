I strongly supported the proposal. As an international student, I understand the hardness and bitterness to find a job in United States. We want to find a job we like and contribute to this industry with all our passion. Some people said we are stealing the job opportunities from native Americans. But I never felt like this in my past internships. All human beings are equal. Sometimes, we get a job because we are more fit in this role and we are able to create more values to the society. This can only be interpreted as competition but not stealing. All in all, everyone has his dream job. An extension in OPT will help us preserve it and realize our values of life.
