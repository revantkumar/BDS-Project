I do think the newly proposed OPT-extension will benefit the economy of US. As we all know, there are thousands of millions of employees who are working with their OPT and OPT extension. A lot of them are STEM majored and work for IT industry, financial sectors or data science, etc. These companies are pillars of US economy and push the nation going further. 

If OPT extension is no longer valid in the near future, we can image a chaos sweeping every industry and a lot of talents have to leave their position. To maintain the stability and well-being of the nation's finance, I would support the new opt extension proposal. I do believe it will add values to the society in every aspect.
