I can not agree with this proposal any more. I am a american, burn in, grow in and work in the USA. There should be a lot of people ask me why I agree with such proposal which may takes job from our citizen.

But, yes, I agree with such proposal. Because I have witnessed so many brilliant foreign students in the university I work for. Not all, but a lot of foreign students have paid their best effort in studying, way more hard working than the local students. For most of local students, they are lack of motivation to work hard. Cause they can find a job way more easier than the international students in the same university. Without any research, I can really feel local students party around every weekend while lots of international students are still working on their projects, homework, or just simply studying for knowledge. 

This proposal intended to create the longer OPT extension period for the STEM majors. What I agree with is the extension is necessary. The STEM majors are significantly from other majors, they need experience. No graduates can assure to be 100% qualified for the job, so there is a gap between graduation and becoming a qualified employee, and this gap mostly will need 2 to 3 years with the training of the employers. 

For those people who adverse such proposal, I can truly understand them. They are afraid, they are sure such proposal will make them pay for the time they wasted at school. They are lack of ability to compete with those hard-working and brilliant foreign students. They worry about the truth that they need to work harder and harder to keep their job position. What I want to tell those adverse ppl is that their is no need for you to be afraid, all you need to do is just to catch up and avoid to be lazy any more. You guys have the advantage of your language and US culture understanding. And this is exactly what this proposal about, to keep your lazy ass moving. 

Yes, I agree with such idea to promote the motivation of people in the USA to keep hard working and never stop progress.
