This is a critical and much needed improvement. The argument that this new provision eats away at opportunities for American students is not well thought-out for two reasons:

1. There is no proof for this argument. The lack of enrollment to STEM programs is the reason that most US universities have a diverse campus. We are invested in ALL students graduating from these programs and not providing all of them a fair shot at jobs here will not help our economy at all - we will continue to have shortages in specialized areas of expertise while turning away talent we need!

2. We should focus on increasing STEM enrollments across all students - instead of turning away talent that is readily available. A strong, vibrant economy needs and deserves this.
