As business analysts, the first year in OPT is more about getting familiar with company business rules, data and people. They start to truly utilize the advanced skill sets and make significant contribution to the company the second year. I believe the 24 months would be good for them to have the full experience and head back home for a senior position. Anyway most companies are used to 3 year turnover and this would be a win win situation for both parties.
