The new regulations benefit the international students with STEM degrees from US universities, the technology companies and also the US economy as the student turned employees would bring in tuition fees and contribute taxes every year. It is a win win situation for all. This would also address the shortage of skilled labour workforce required by US companies. I support the new proposed rule.
