I find it abominable that the government would even consider expanding the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, giving employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. This is an obvious play for employers to get around the H-1B cap. Not only would this violate the Congressional intent of the H-1B program, it has been found to be susceptible to fraud by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as noted in their report issued in March 2014.

The people and workers of the United States won't tolerate this latest attempt by their government to allow our corporations to feed their greed at our expense.
