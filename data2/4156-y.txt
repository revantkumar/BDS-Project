jessmie otto I am totally support the Optional Practical Training (OPT), and its extension rule. Immigrants have enriched American culture and enhanced our influence in the world. 

Immigration is not undermining the American experiment; it is an integral part of it. We are a nation of immigrants. Successive waves of immigrants have kept our country demographically young, enriched our culture and added to our productive capacity as a nation, enhancing our influence in the world.

OPT gives the United States an economic edge in the world economy. It bring innovative ideas and entrepreneurial spirit to the U.S. economy. Sergey Brin, the founder of google, is from Russian. Steven jobs is decedent of Syria. If there is no OPT, that would not google or no Apples.
