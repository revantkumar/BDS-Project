Mike Wu I support this because American tech firms need more international STEM students to work. Tech firms are the most important part of US economy, they create taxes, job opportunities, and they need people who know tech. Frankly, many American students do not like to study computer science, math or other STEM majors. Where could these companies find the worker they need?
