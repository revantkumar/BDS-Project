Comments on the Mentoring and Training Plan (M&TP):
Summary: The proposal for an M&TP, while admirable in theory, is in practice fraught with weaknesses which weaken the purpose of the Plan. The inability to effecgtively prepare and evaluate an academic-based program by those employers and DSOs without the necessary academic gtraining and relationships will leat, agt best, to superficial review, approval, and verification of the Plan and, more seriously, to an increased potential for fraud in presenting the Plan and in the approval and validation of STEM OPT employment.
A detailed presentation of this summary is given in the attached, uploaded file letter.
