I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. The proposed expansion would allow U.S. businesses to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent U.S. college graduates, who have the required qualifications to satisfy the position requirements of the business hiring to fill the position, struggling to find employment, it is not the province of DHS to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizen employees over U.S. citizens. The proposed rule arbitrarily and effectively decreases the cost to the business of filling its position offered with a lower cost foreign employee. This proposed rule would establish by default, a Federal government subsidization of the business doing the hiring distorting the free market in establishing the prevailing wage for employees with the requisite skills required of the position being filled. This proposed rule would permanently lower the prevailing wage, thus, promulgating a mass hiring of foreign citizen graduates over available, qualified U.S. college graduates who are citizens. Should this proposed rule be enacted, the reduction to Social Security payments forecasted is immense - projected to be as much as $1 billion. With a projected deficit that challenges the solvency of the Social Security program, this is not the direction to take to assist in sustaining Social Security solvency. Furthermore, this proposed rule promulgated by the DHS, imposes on the province exclusively of the US Congress and is in opposition to the intent of the US Senate, in its establishment of the H-1B program.
