I strongly agree with improving and expanding OPT. The major reason is it keeps our economy blooming and on top of world. 

We are country that are based on immigrants. No matter it is the first British people across the sea to settle this country, or German scientists in world war II includes Einstein, and John von Neumann, or todays entrepreneur includes Elon Mask, Satya Nadalla, they pushed our country a big step forward. Now imagine, after the elites of their company travel across the world travel this far to our country receives the best education in our country and being excellence in engineering and technology, but they have to get back to their country cause we dont allow them to stay here, what a loss! The truth is, they probably not going to consider being here at the first place since they would not be able to stay. 

We do know European is once the leading region in the world and is still now a tech center of the world. But how they does not evolve any Company like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. There might be a lot of reasons behind this. However, not getting the best people might be a very serious reason.
We can see how fast blooming China and India IT industry is growing after we have seen Alibaba group has launch the biggest IPO ever in US stock market. It happens because their education system are educating lots of engineers and scientists, and people do stay. This is a clear example that people make great companies and make our life better.

Nowadays, even with the previous 17 months extension, our top companies still needs to outsource thousands of technical jobs to the world cause we are lacking of enough smart people in United States. By extending OPT by 24 months would at least ease on this problem and help our company to continue leading the world.
