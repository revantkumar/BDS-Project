Ciel Liu This is definitely a good idea to expand the OPT. Well, millions of immigrants came to US during the past centuries but she becomes the #1 in the world and the American workers become much more richer rather than die. The OPT will attract more highly educated people, improving the technologies and economy in US. It's not a simply subtraction. They will create more jobs. In addition, you all should know Albert Einstein was an immigrant from Germany in 1933. But now you guys are rejecting millions of Einstein in 21st century.
