Since there is currently insufficient security measures to prevent fraud in the program and to improve the Departments ability to know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country, please require the following:
- Issue program biometric ID cards that require fingerprints and photos that can be access nationally
- ID cards must be reissued, or reconfirmed in person annually, only upon a confirmed physical confirmation, to remain in the program
- Lack of a confirmed in person annual confirmation will cause the student to be dropped from the program and required to leave the country, after a 30 day grace period.

When the annual U6 unemployment rate exceeds 7% the program will be limited to 40,000 F-1 students in the OPT program per year. When the annual U6 unemployment rate exceeds 9% the program will be suspended for the coming year. When the U6 unemployment rate exceeds 10% the program will be suspended for the upcoming 3 year period and total F-1 students in the country will be limited to 75,000 at any given time.

Employers of all OPT students will be required to pay the appropriate FICA/Medicare payments into the system regardless of the students resident status.
