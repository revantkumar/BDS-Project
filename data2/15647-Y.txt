YES, OPT-extension would be in the best interest of our nation.

The U.S. should let the international students majoring in a STEM subject stay longer in the country as this can continously boost the technological and economic development of the U.S. For example, Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Without their contribution, a lot of domestic industries could not have been so prosperous, e.g. IT. 

Even worse, the US will lose its competitiveness if STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!

Also, they are very important contributors to US social welfare system. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people.
