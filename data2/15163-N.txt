The Homeland Security Training Program is a disguised attempt to DISCRIMINATE 
against the hardworking qualified American Student and worker. Only the foreign student
gets Government help, not the American Student, at American taxpayer expense. What 
Fraud! 
And Regulations fail to impose any penalties for violation of the Regulations or student visa fraud. Nor do employers have any penalties for practicing fraud in hiring these 
foreigners. This program encourages criminal fraud and worse eliminates the American student from receiving any of the Government help. That is a Travesty.
And worse is the danger to American Security. The FBi has publicly stated that there are so many student spies, it is impossible to keep track. An exaggeration? Talk to the FBI.
Homeland Security is supposed to protect America, not undermine the American.
This program must be ended immediately and all efforts should be made to help highly intelligent well educated American Students to succeed in STEM.
Investigate and defund the Homeland Security Department and replace it with young Military men who know how to defend our Borders. 
OPT is an abomination!
