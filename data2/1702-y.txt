Tony Liu I strongly support extending the OPT period for foreign students. They help the US economy in multiple ways. They spend money on local business around their schools and around where they work. They create values for our society. And especially they are STEM degrees so they can help the United States to stay competitive on a global scale. Some of the students that I know even started their own business and got venture funding then hired American citizens.
