Di Mei This rule is to help STEM students work with OPT after graduation. It's not a rule trying to give them greencard. Some say those students replace American workers because they ask for lower wages. However, the ones who actually steal the jobs from American workers are international employees from outsourcing companies. As reported by New York Times, one-third H1-B visa were granted to outsourcing companies (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/06/us/outsourcing-companies-dominate-h1b-visas.html). Those people, mostly from India, ask for much lower wages, which affects American workers. 

One the other hand, the international students with real talent and smart have to leave US due to the expiration of OPT and denial of H1-B application (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/large-companies-game-h-1b-visa-program-leaving-smaller-ones-in-the-cold.html). Even worse, the Washington court invoked the OPT couple months ago, which means they have to leave US immediately after graduation. This rule will help those people stay here and provide with their innovation and talent to tech companies.

In summary, this rule relieves the pressure of H1-B Cap for excellent STEM students. Also, it wouldn't help to import more outsourcing workers from foreign countries. I strongly support this rule!
