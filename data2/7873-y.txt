Dennis Lee As a professor at an esteemed university, I support the proposed rule. Do you know why the American students do well in life ? Because they have been exposed to so many different cultures in their classrooms. You take away STEM, guess what will happen. The students start going elsewhere. The Universities suffer, the students don't get a diverse classroom. Slowly and steadily, some other country, with more liberal immigration rules, will attract these students. I support this rule for the above reasons.
