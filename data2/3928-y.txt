Chenjie Tang I strongly SUPPORT the proposed rule. Reasons are as follow: 
1. In the department of science, technology and engineering, over 70% Masters and 75% PhDs are international students in my university. The US universities and faculties spend so much time (2 years for MS and 5 years for PhDs) and resources (funding, lab tools) on training international students, but if those international students do not have enough time to work in US after graduation, it would be a GREAT LOSS to technology and engineering field to US society. 
2. There are so many tech companies contributed a lot to the GDP growth of US. And tech companies rely a lot on international students since those international students REALLY DID A GREAT JOB in the field of technology and engineering. As we know it takes some time to train the new employees to fit the work in companies. But if there is no OPT extension and the international students should leave US just after they get trained in the company, it would be a GREAT LOSS to the tech companies and US economy.
3. The STEM extension does not affect the overall H1b visa numbers and immigrant policy thus it does not make sense as some people stated that the proposal would let more foreigners enjoy US citizens' benefit.
4. The United State of America is a free country and everyone has the right to compete and live. It is true as the foundation of USA, not only for legally citizens but also for the people from other countries who study and work in this field!
