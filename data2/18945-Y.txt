I strongly agree with this proposal. 

For those who are thinking about that local candidates have to compete with international students, I would say you may be wrong. Since in this proposal, it regulates that for companies who want to hire international students must do enough work to make sure the employment will not affect the local candidates. This proposal is not against local candidates but it is actually a protection for the local labor.

On the other hand, if there is no such regulation, what will happen? At first, there will be less and less students coming to the US for study and work especially the students who did better than average. This means the US will lose a lot of talents and genius. What is the most important in 21st century? Talents! After losing those people, the science, the economy, and the technology will fall behind. Small companies will be shut down due to lack of talents, and then big companies will be the same. And more and more investors and rich people will leave the US. They are not idiot. They know when and where to invest. They will never invest on a piece of land losing people and talents. After all these fall back, it will be much harder for people who live here to get a job. 

So supporting this proposal is not against local labor. It is actually protecting the industry, the economy and all the people in the US for a better future!!
