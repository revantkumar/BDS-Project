Andrew Kohler I strongly support STEM OPT extension for 24 months for eligible F1 students. This helps USA to retain talented and skilled technical personnel in the country. This will also better the chances for these individuals get the H1B visa. It is a wrong notion that extending OPT STEM is robbing American citizens of their jobs because most of the OPT STEM candidate work in engineering and technical fields in which Americans are poorly represented. So to retain the diverse and talented workforce, this extension will be very helpful. If USCIS annuls the OPT extension, then US will no longer be an attractive destination for foreign technical students. This could hurt US economy in the long run.
