I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. I came to US for pursuing Master degree, and the most important reason that I choose US is because I could get working experience through OPT/OPT-extension after graduation. Without OPT extension, I believe a significant amount of students will choose other countries instead of US for education and make contribution to other countries instead of US after graduation. Besides, High-tech companies like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook in US hired many OPT/OPT-extension employees. If these employees cannot work in US anymore, it is definitely not good for US economy.

2. I am now working at a US high-tech company. In my company, many projects require more than a year to be completed. It would be great OPT/OPT-extension employees can also get involved in these projects and make contributions to their companies.

3. E-verify is a must for OPT extension and E-Verify helps preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status.
