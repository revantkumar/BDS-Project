I strongly oppose this expansion of the rules that favor hiring foreigners over American workers. In this bad economy with so many American citizens out of work, the LAST thing that our government should be doing is encouraging companies to hire foreigners and permitting these foreigners to stay beyond their legal visa limits. Our government is supposed to be acting in the interest of American citizens, not large companies that want cheap foreign workers!
