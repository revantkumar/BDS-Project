I am surprised many people believe the jobless problem will be diluted if we closed the door for these foreign students. It seems they choose to ignore that many American companies are loosing their competitiveness on global market. And it seems companies named Samsung, Huaway ... never bother us. I hate to say we are selfish to beg a job for ourselves, but when the tech companies off-shore their business, or just die, I know it will hurt not one but thousands families. I support DHS to save jobs IN US, and I support DHS to save the talents for US.
