Some of those students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the United States. This is why many of students like me chose to pursue degree further in America, not other countries a few years ago. This is a great attraction to foreign students and that's the best way to have more talented people.
