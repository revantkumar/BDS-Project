Zheyuan Ding I support this proposal to improve opportunities for F-1 students.
I work in an engineering company involved in automotive industry. Last year we hire 7 international students because their good potential and performance. And as a result, they did good jobs in the company. But this year, our HR is willing to hire american students, to avoid sponsoring international students about immigration issue. But it is so hard to hire a good fit candidate. I am not saying Americans are not good at engineering. But you can see the in an STEM class, more than half come from overseas. If STEM extend cancelled, these international graduates can't work for US. It would be a great loss for the states' economy.
