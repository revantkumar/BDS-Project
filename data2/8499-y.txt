Shannon Seibert To those who object the proposal and are afraid of foreign STEM students: 
1. No government in the world will stand against their people, especially the U.S. government. The country lauched the OPT policy for those international STEM students for a reason. See how they benefit this country's tech industry and how their mother countries feel heartbroken to lose their top talents. 
2. Even though the international students have the OPT extension,they are still at a disadvantage when competing with the native students. Why the companies will try so hard to hire a foreign student while they have a better native candidate who can fit in the company quickly and who can save a big amount of money(the sponsoring fee) for the it?
I hope the policy can awake Americans. If you are afraid of being stolen of the jobs, work harder than your international counterparts and don't blame for the policy!
