The Regulations fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regulations or student fraud. This visa program is the most fraud-riddled of all the visa programs that, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, allows foreign students to spy on U.S. government agencies and employers. The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.

You can't actually be this stupid, I hope. Why does this administration continue to keep American workers on the bench, while fast-tracking workers from other nations?
