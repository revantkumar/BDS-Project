Iris Song I do support this new OPT rule. As a graduate student of Science, I know how long should we be trained in a new project. For example, I was trained for six months for my first project and helped other scientists for another four months before I started a project for my PI. Technically, training for new employees could last at least six months, and it's after that period that employees begin to create benefits for the employers. Under this circumstance, expanding OPT could help employers get more valuable benefits comparing to what they've put in training new employees. Also, longer OPT could help the employers control their personnel change more smoothly. The current employed F1 students could have enough time to train new employees to take on a long-term project before their OPT ends. obviously, this is an effective way to avoid massive shortage of qualified personnel.
