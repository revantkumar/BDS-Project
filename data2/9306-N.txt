If the economy and financial well being of the American people is truly an area of concern for the present government , this proposed improving ans expanding training opportunities program is not going to benefit the Americans trying to find work. This proposal will allow people from other countries to take (and keep for a longer period of time) jobs from the Americans looking for work. Although we provide great educational opportunities through our universities or training programs for foreign students it is a detriment to our work force at home if we give the jobs available to those foreign students. OPT's are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger and work cheaper than their American competitors. In an economy where many businesses are closing because of "high" overhead expenses an employer is given a 7.65% break on the OPT's salary since they are not paying payroll taxes that would be paid on a United States citizens paycheck. The OPT's salary "break to the employer" is a loss to the U.S. governments bottom line...they do not get the tax revenue that these jobs would pay if American were the employees.
Please re-consider this proposed rule expanding opportunities for foreign students at this time, giving the American's in need of work the first opportunity for good jobs.
Thank you for your consideration.
