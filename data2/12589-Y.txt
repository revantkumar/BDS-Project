I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Foreign students who take higher education from U.S. universities can make contributions to the well being of all people at U.S.

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S, and this proposal strongly encourages diversity at U.S companies.

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing, and it can promote the efficiency and quality of all companies as well as their products.
