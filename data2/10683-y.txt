Ethan Manz I strongly support the STEM OPT extension program.

Cancelling the OPT extension program will damage the IT industry to a great extent. As we all know, the growth of American IT industry has been heavily contributed by tech start-ups; among all these start-ups, a large amount were founded by non-US citizens. If the OPT extension is cancelled, lots of IT talents will lose motivation in starting new businesses since it's likely that they can only work for 12 months. 

Without the startup spirit, the Silicon Valley will die! Please keep America's long-term interest in mind!
