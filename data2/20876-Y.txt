I definitely support the proposal to improve and expand OPT up to three years as total.The government should let the students who learned knowledge from US universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the US. Someone mentioned competition and used this as a weapon.This is really ungrounded. Competition does exist, but it is positive. It helps improve the efficiency as well as pushing the companies to make great progresses.
