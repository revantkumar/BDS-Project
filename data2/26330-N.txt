I find many opposed reviews quote the index that " stem students denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 and removed $4 billion (with a B) from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds". I am very curious about this index, so i search the internet. This index is from a article named "430,000 Lost Jobs to Illegal Aliens Between 2009-2013. Thanks go to Obama" posted in california political revew. some of comments maybe make a mistake to equal illegal aliens to stem students. if you finished this article you want find this " a total of something on the order of 430,000 jobs were denied to resident workers because of this program; some 64,000 of these jobs were in the STEM fields". Among 430000 jobs stolen by aliens, just 10% of them from Stem students, however the GDP contribution form stem students is ignored by them totally. 

I definitely support this proposal to extend the extra opt from 17 months to 24 months. this is a best policy not only for the government but for the public. Talented international students worked in stem field will contribute the GDP and the taxes they payed will increase the government revenue. The local american will also get benefits form the strong economy they will have more job opportunities and get more welfare form a rich government.
