Even the current OPT program has never been authorized by Congress. Under current immigration law, F-1 visa holders are NOT allowed to hold a job after graduation, and they promise to leave within 60 days of completing their coursework.

Companies have pushed colleges to have stem students do coops. Most engineering students now have to work 1 year to get their degree. This one year is already Optional Practical Training. This program is stupid and unnecessary and redundant!!!

"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 yearsthe same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be validthere is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley

Is this why most engineers are laid off of work by being given 'early retirement' sometime between age 57 and age 65? Is this why the labor participation rate is so low? Think about it!
