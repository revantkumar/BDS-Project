1.Extending OPT for STEM students will largely decrease corporate's risk of not gaining enough workforce domestically.It is usually agreed that a significant part of STEM majors are filled with foreign students. If OPT extension is not granted, many firms will not be able to hire locally but instead will shift their hiring focus to oversea labor market. Eventually, firms may have more sites abroad.Costs and revenues that are expensed overseas will not benefit our GDP.

2. All the living expenses from foreign students will benefit U.S. economy. If students have notable research results while they work in the states, it belongs to the states. 

3. If firms hire OPT students without extensions, and students did not get a H1B during the one year window, the training costs will be wasted.
