US has been the global leader for science, specifically for physics research, which has attracted more and more talented scientists to US. This in turn makes it easier for US to continue its leadership in science. If US had an extension for OPT after graduation, talented young graduates could devote more time of their life to the development of US. I believe this would benefit US too.
