I support the regulation for the following reasons:

1. America is the country which provides equal opportunities for both native and international students. So when an international person is hired by a company, that means that the company values his/her abilities. In this sense, the individual is capable of doing the job. The STEM Extenstion enables the person to further boost his/her values valued by the company.

2. International students advance local economy as well. People like to travel around, experiencing different parts of America, which they might not be able to see in their own countries. Tourism takes up a great portion of American economy. So it is beneficial to keep international students around with the STEM Extension, which also helps with the U.S. economy.
