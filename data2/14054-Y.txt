I think extending the OPT program is helping the US government hold as much talented brains as possible. It is a must have to keep this country as the number one creative country in the world. This country has already outsourced too much job opportunity oversea which is one of the main reasons that caused the unemployment issue. It would be stupid to fail on keeping the creative minds in this country who is and will continue to be the backbone of new job creators. Overall, international students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people.
