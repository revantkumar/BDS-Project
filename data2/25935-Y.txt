I SUPPORT this proposal strongly for this following reasons:

This proposal will make a great positive contribution to the American economy and the STEM industries, such as IT. This proposal focus on the STEM industries, which grow very fast and have a large amount of job openings that it is hard to find the right candidates to fit in. For example, one of the biggest IT companies in the world, Google, has 2062 job openings and at least 95% of these positions are STEM relative positions. For a lot of companies, no matter they are IT companies or in other industries, no matter they are large-size company or small size, they all have the similar situation--A lot of STEM positions are open but it is harder and harder to find good candidates for them. These companies all play very important roles in and make huge impact to American economy. 

For a company, If it continues to have this problem--it is hard to find right candidates for the openings, its growth and development will slow down or even the business will fail eventually. For an industry, if this problem continues and expands, the whole industry will stop developing and start falling apart. If this kind of depression happens in a lot of companies and across many industries, there will be another really long and harmful winter for American's winter. At that time, large amounts of companies will close their business, which cause millions of people lost their jobs. 

But if this proposal is effective successfully, it will solve this problem and bring a big positive impact to the companies who are lack of candidates. It will help them to grow faster, healthier and more strongly. At the same time, they will create more job positions for Americans and are more willing to pay higher salaries. 

Thus, I think supporting this proposal and making it effective is extremely important for U.S, to keep the rise of its economy and also the development of the companies.
