Tracy Fitzgerald International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.
