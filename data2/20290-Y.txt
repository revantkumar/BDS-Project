I am engineer and alumnus from MIT and I see the outcome of poor immigration policy all the time. Many of my friends have been forced the leave the United States because of archaic and nonsensical laws. These individuals are motivated, intelligent, and are productive members of society. But instead of working, these students have to jump through hoops and spend late nights worrying about being deported. Often they are forced to leave the country once their Visas expire despite having jobs at American companies or to continue on with school instead of bolstering the American economy. We should be trying to keep these individuals within our borders, not forcing them to meander through a system that indiscriminately might ship them away.
