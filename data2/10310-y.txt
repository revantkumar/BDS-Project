Anny Xiang I strongly support this proposal. First of all, technological innovation is key to US. Think about all the great innovation STEM students have been invented, what's the point if they're not able to continue innovating in the industry. A longer OPT extension not only gives them a longer time to be able to stay in the US and developing their innovative ideas, but also allows them to have 3 chances instead of 2 to win H1-B lottery. It is so exciting to think about how much more biomedical drugs can be discovered to cure diseases and how many more high-tech products can be created to improve people's life. Second, this proposal will not lead to jobs stolen by foreign people because we have other effective immigration policies to prevent that from happening, such as LCA requirement and capitation of H1-B each year. Not to mention that there are always higher demand than need in STEM related jobs, and you have to admit that foriegners do do better in those jobs. Last but not least, the spending power from foreigners and their family is key to support US economic growth. Yesterday was some random Single's Day holiday in China, and only one day sales of Alibaba was close to 15 billion USD. This is close to Ebay's whole year revenue!! I'm sure no one would want to lose the huge spending power foreign students and their family can bring to the US. Having favorable immigration policies will help attract them to the US and contribute to US economic growth. I can only see so many benefits of this proposal. Therefore, I would hope this proposal can be approved.
