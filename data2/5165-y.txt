Amit Patil I greatly appreciate this new rule making for the following reasons:

1. Currently US economy is in pretty good shape with most of the tech firms reporting positive results. Without proposed rule for OPT extension, there will be a sudden unrest to the whole STEM field related businesses and we don't want that.

2. This rule give all the STEM OPT employers time and chance to plan their work assignments. They would know that the OPT employee would be there for more time and they can invest in them. 

3. Complexity of the STEM jobs is getting more and more complex everyday. Due to this, just a single year of OPT is not beneficial for employer as well as student. It takes time for a newly hired person to understand the whole complexity. With STEM extension, employer would have a guarantee that the OPT worker will still be there in the firm after the initial expensive training.

4. This rule is essential for holding on to the young and fresh graduates who might have a great business idea, a great concept which is not implemented because of the Visa issues. 

5. Highly skilled professional have created numerous jobs and billion dollar businesses in the United States of America. Today, all the students who wish to invent something look forward to the USA for better opportunities. If this rule doesn't go through, this might change forever. Students will avoid coming to US as rules won't be favorable as they are now. 

6. Generally when a student graduates and lands a job, he/she would spend a good amount knowing there will be a substantial continuous income thereafter. If OPT extension is revoked, students won't spend much during their OPT year, since they might end up losing job a year later. This kind of slows the currency flow in the country. 

For keeping everything smooth and not disturbing what is great for both OPT students and US as country, I strongly recommend this rule.
