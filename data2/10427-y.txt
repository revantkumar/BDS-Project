Elizabeth Shelby I have never heard of anything so ridiculous. Why are you even considering allowing foreign students/graduates to take opportunities that American's and their families have worked so hard to be able to achieve. Ahh, but there are not any American students capable of the work you say, well SHAME ON YOU for not ensuring they have adequate education to be able to do so and if they do have adequate education then why would you even consider a foreign student over an American one. Its nothing short of a DISGRACE!
