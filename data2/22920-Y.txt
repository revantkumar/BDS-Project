The proposed new STEM extension would be very useful to the United States as it would allow foreign students trained in the USA to utilize the skills learned in the US to benefit the US economy. The total 3 years would allow maximum utilization of these skills to the economy as studies in the past have shown that for a full impact cycle a period of at least a couple of years is needed for any clear and significant change or improvement upon the utilization of a skill or practice. In this case 3 years would be an ideal amount of time for a program like this.
