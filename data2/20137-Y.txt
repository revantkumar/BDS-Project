The STEM OPT Extension should be extended to 29 months. This gives an opportunity to the students to learn the industrial culture getting an experience in their domain. Plus, it gives an opportunity to them to earn an living paying off the education loans. This is a very positive and wonderful rule in interest of both the students and country's growth.
