The 24-month OPT extension will be an important regulation for high tech companies and international students. The approval of such regulation absolutely will make more f1 students with advanced STEM degree have opportunities to seek job in U.S. Such jobs can't be filled by Americans. I absolutely spport the approval of this proposed regulation.
