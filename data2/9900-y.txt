Ravitej Jakati Being an international student, we come to the US with a hope to create an excellent career and make our foundation very strong! 

This OPT is a blessing in disguise. WE NEED IT!! 

It would be unfair to send all of us international students to go back after helping the economy of the country grow!

I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE NEW RULE!!!
