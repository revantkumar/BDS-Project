Stem, foreign students and Optional Practical Training: Where's the Common Sense? Help our students First; our Unemployed First. Wages are down due to employment of foreigners; our graduates unemployed. Employers (including big tech lobbyists) need to pay our citizens a decent wage. What about the Medicare and Social Security not paid by these foreigners? More obscure regulations to demean this country. Ridiculous.
