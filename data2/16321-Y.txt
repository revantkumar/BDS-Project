As a public health graduate, I strongly support the OPT extension program. This program will benefit not only international students dedicated to public health, but also public health research in the U.S. From my own experience, international students often bring a new perspective in class discussion and research, and can work very well as research coordinators for projects conducted in international settings. The OPT extension program will enable them to keep making contributions in public health research even after graduation.
