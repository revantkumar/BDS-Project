I strongly support this new proposal and I think it would be worthwhile for both U.S. citizens and international students if this proposal is implemented. This would be a win-win proposal, beneficial for both U.S. citizens and international students. 
International student come to the U.S. not only for study. They will need places to live, need food to eat, need to travel in the United States and need to buy cars to get around. They are contributing a lot to the real estate development in the area where their schools are located. They buy cars and support the local car dealership industry. They travel around in the United States and create a large amount to revenue for hotels and transportation industries. 
Also, if the OPT extension is cut off and only last for one year, many internationals students would be forced to leave the U.S. One year of time is very short, especially if someone starts working. I dont think U.S. companies would want to lose these large amount of talented workers and even some of them are well trained and are ready to work on their own within the company. Companies are forced to outsource these talented workers to other offices in other countries and they will not be able to leave these talents within U.S.
