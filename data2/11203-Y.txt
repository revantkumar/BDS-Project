Re: Comments on Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students

80 Fed. Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)

Docket ID: ICEB-2015-0002

Dear Chief Westerlund:

The following are my thoughts in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students," published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

I have been an international student in the United States since 2012. I am pursuing a STEM degree and will graduate in Dec 2015 with a Masters degree in the field of Mechanical engineering. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my future employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.

I was glad to see the proposed rule for re-instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and most importantly the increased extension period.

The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates

OPT STEM Extension is one of the major reasons why students like me choose to relocate to the United States for our advanced degrees. I do my research in the area of Metal matrix Nano-composites, there are only a handful of institutions worldwide which work in this field, most of them are located in the United States. So, starting December, I need to be able to find a position in one of these places (which being an international student will be difficult), then start working within 3 m
