I am against increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because American citizens need jobs and opportunities. American graduates from college are having a harder time than ever obtaining jobs, internships, and research opportunities and facing lower wages due to excessive competition from foreign labor. Companies like Facebook support the extension because they like cheap labor. I support American citizens. We need to give the best and the brightest students that are from this country every opportunity to succeed in the U.S. - not more imports that allow large corporations to jack up their profits.
