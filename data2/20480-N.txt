Once again the US government shows the American Citizen how much we do not mean to them. Our congress has repeatedly betrayed the unemployed American worker by upping the quota of H1B users and now this. 

It amazes me that our government is so tone deaf. One would think that the recent election cycle would be a wake up call. 

The American People are awakening; be prepared to be voted out.
