Dear Sirs:

I believe that jobs must first be filled by Americans. Americans should be trained and employed as a first option rather than looking to foreigners.

I further believe that bringing in foreigners to fill jobs that Americans should have harms our country in a number of ways; intellectually and economically. You should be training Americans first and foremost and reducing the number of foreigners.
