Sophie Butler You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.
