Nanxiang Zhang I strongly support this new OPT policy
'm an international graduate student from China. It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students..

STEM OPT extension helps to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. Because this is a really attractive policy for the international student, and most of them will choose to contribute their knowledge to the US academic or industry area after their graduation. 

Secondly, if there is no OPT extension, many many foreign students will choose other countries such as German or Australia, which has better policy for them to develop. OPT extension could help US universities gain more attention from students in other countries, which could help US universities collect more money in the future. In this way, US universities will become better and better, and keep becoming top universities.

In addition, I believe U.S. employers will benefit from the knowledge, not only professional skills, but also customs and languages of their own countries from STEM OPT students, and this will give the U.S. a jump on its foreign rivals in getting new products to market fast. For example, the Uber China Growth team and TripAdvisor China team will surely need to know more about local market. If these companies expands, like Uber, they will produce more work opportunities for people in the US.
