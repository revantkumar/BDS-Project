I strongly support the opt extension.

I am a graduate student in Massachusetts. For the three years stay in a small town. I noticed that almost half of the renting apartments are leased by foreign student or it will leave empty. Foreign students bring a boost to the economy and education area in U.S in everywhere. We paid a lot of taxes in the country. While, the stem opt extension is a thrilling point for us foreign student. We heard a lot about it before and took it into consideration when choosing what country to study. The opt extension will definitely take an effect on the education and economy area of America.

I am trying to find a job right now. I need to tell you the truth that all the American companies prefer native citizen rather than foreign student. For a foreign student, it's much more harder to apply for a job than you American guys. I don't know the why some Americans think foreign students take your jobs. Do you really think about your skills and the knowledge you learned? I mean companies always choose the perfect man for the job. If you are not qualified for the job, please don't think about it may concern with foreign student because they really prefer you guys. 

I think without this policy, numerous companies in the United States will face a serious shortage of STEM workers suddenly and tremendous loss.
