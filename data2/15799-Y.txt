I totally support expanding OPT for F-1 students. Science and technology are always the strongest power to keep the leading position of the United States in the world. I cannot imagine how much innovation and creativity we will lose if lots of talented STEM students want to contribute to the future of the country but stopped by policies. This is not about giving F-1 students an opportunity, but about giving the most important industry's future an opportunity.
