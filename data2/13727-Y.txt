The OPT extension should be granted effective immediately. I came to the US to study so that I can eventually start working, get H1B, get Green Card and eventually settle for life here. Where I come from, no opportunity exists for skilled STEM graduates. Why should I be punished for being born in a wrong country? I deserve equal footing as anyone else anywhere in the world. I love US and I want to settle in the US, and that is why I came here to study. The 36 months OPT offers me 3-4 opportunities to file H1B while in the US and hopefully get picked, which will pave way for my Green Card application. 

With H1B quota limited to 85,000 a year, and every year US receiving over 200,000 H1B applications, it becomes difficult for international students, such as I, to get H1B, if the OPT exists only for 12 months. Everyone who came here to study wants to settle in the US. What's wrong in that? I am highly skilled and I will contribute the most to the US. If the OPT Stem extension is not granted then very few my country will come to study in the US, as a result US will loose all the student tuition. 

I implore US govt to grant international students some respite. Either grant us Green Card when we graduate from the grad school, or make unlimited H1Bs for international students who studies in the US. Until then OPT Stem extension is our saving grace to live in the US and keep trying for H1B, hoping it's picked.
