Improving and Extending OPT for F1 nonimmigrant students is not only beneficial to the job market but also to the well being of USA. 

I am currently working in High tech industry and I deeply fell that out company is always eager to recruit good engineers and analysts who have STEM background. The job market of Software/Hardware engineering, even though large, cannot fulfill all working force requirements for companies from startups to companies like Google and Apple. I have seen my friends, who is an American citizen, worried about finding any legit engineer for his startup and keep them for at least two years. The success of many American companies is closely associated with engineering resource greatly composed of international students who got a degree here in USA. Honestly speaking, in engineering world, american students barely have a trouble finding jobs. The reality is that many companies are seeking good engineering resources but restrained by the fact that international students have to be sponsored in short period of time for applying H1B visa and this costs. What makes it worse is that sponsorship cannot guarantee the visa. Due to this we can see there are a lot of unfair ways to increasing the chance of getting H1B and with an extension of OPT, I believe this can be mitigated.

If OPT got extended, companies will be released from the pressure to sponsor new hired international graduates right after they join the company. This is good because a good amount of money could be spent elsewhere. For startups, this will be a great news.
