I Strongly support this extention because my passion is on finance and American is best country to provide me an oppotunity to learn finiancial engineering, Meanwhile, as China falls far more behind in financial engineering industry, I hope I can work in America for some time to know how the most advanced financial industry works and then come back my own country to make contribution. 12 month is too short for a thorough learning.
I also think American people should be confident abou yourselves. As the economy of America is recovering, there are more oppotunities and the international won't influent the job finding of the native. 
also the international students can only get hired when they can do more for the company. So it's meaningless to give them . disadvantage on the immigrant policy.
