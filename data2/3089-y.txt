Daisy Wu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

Working as OPT doesn't lead to immigration straightly. It's the H1B visa that decides immigration, while OPT is only an extension of student's status. I am an international graduate student but have no preference for immigration. After gaining the education and working experience in United States it's easier for me to find a job anywhere else in the world. It's not only in the US that we can have happy life. Please don't suppose that every international student has a tendency to immigration.

And as international students, our tuition is three times as much as local students. Universities take great financial benefit from us while many companies don't hire foreiners at the very begining. OPT policy is a strong reason that motivates us to study abroad. Cancelling OPT extension will surely lead to a decrease of financial bonus from internaional students.

Most of the STEM students here are excellent in their original country. We have to be more qualified than local students to get a job while most of the local students have strong people network for job hunting and don't have to overcome the language problem. As a result it's more challenging for us to look for jobs and we are not taking over job opportunities from American students. International students are providing great workforce and various techniques for the US companies. Companies need excellent employees, no matter international or not. Equal competition helps to improve general productivity and profit.
