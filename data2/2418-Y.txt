It is indisputable that opt extension would make some universities more attractive for the internationals students,especially the non-top universities.
And most of the non-top unis locate in middle US or some remote suburbans. The increase of international students in these barren lands will cause a boost in the local economy. For example,which American students want to go Indiana? However,the single room in the apartment near Purdue University cost alomost 1100$ per month, which mostly contributes to the international students in West Lafayette.So are the dear apartments in Tennessee, Oregon,etc.Without opt extension which means without enough international students, who knows what will happen.
