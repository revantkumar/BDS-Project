As an American citizen tech worker, I find it troubling that the Department of Homeland Security would tilt the playing field in favor of foreign students with the Optional Practical Training program. When so many citizen tech workers are already working outside their field of expertise, it is not fair to us having to compete with lower cost foreign workers. Please do not expand this program when so many Americans are under employed in the tech industries.
