I do support this 24 months STEM extension for F1 students. This is unique opportunity for international students to have better experience in the most advance industrialized country, which would be very helpful for them to grow further in their professional life; also, with more young and versatile resources in market it would be easy for any employer to take up new endeavor with dynamic resources at economic wages, which is eventually going to benefit US economy. Thus it is win win situation for both international students and US economy.
