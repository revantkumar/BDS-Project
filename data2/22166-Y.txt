I am international student from China. The reason why I chose academic institute in US instead of those in England or Australia, is not because of US has higher tuition fee but for the opportunities provided by US Government through OPT, which helps us apply the knowledge we have learned in US. I believe OPT is one of the most important reason to attract more international students to come and study in US. Moreover statistics indicates the fact that international students help pushed the American economy significantly. Thus, it is unwise to deny the benefit of 24 months OPT extension.
