I strongly disagree this extension for STEM students. Because the most brilliant international students are reading business and arts degrees. Such extension will deteriorate the students who are reading other degree, which is not equal. STEM students should not have such a priority. We should shorten the period of STEM students and longer the period for other degree students.
