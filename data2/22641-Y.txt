Awesome extension rule!
The reason that U.S attracted international student and benefit from these students is not only it's high-level education but also, even more importantly, it's industrial practical allowance. Without out the practical training, there will be huge cut down on the attractively of study in the U.S. which will in turn lower the amount of international students, and decrease the education incoming for the U.S.. People seems to ignore an important truth that the most amount of student in U.S collage is Americans. they are the people who will be affect most if the university cannot afford it's high level education as past. I see no reason to disagree with giving student practical training which is absolutely a brilliant rule benefit both international student and U.S citizen.
