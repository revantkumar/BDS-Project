The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of both STEM students and employers.
A lot of talented students in STEM field are willing to contribute themselves to the development of America and realize their own values here and the extension is kind of the only way for them to do that.

If the extension is cancelled, there will be a significant loss for the STEM employers as well as the governments for losing so many outstanding employees. A lot of problems will arise as the current issued H1B visa will expire.
