I support the OPT extension. 
Many international students spend years pursuing degrees in the states. However, many of them leave the country before they can get a real job. After returning to home country, they are not as competitive as those with working experience, although without a degree from the states. They start to realize the benefit of the degree is not as expected. Eventually, studying aboard will become less advantageous than studying in home country, considering the latter is a lot cheaper.
