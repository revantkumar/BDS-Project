Chris John Improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students is beneficial to the development of technology.

There is no absolute fair in this world, but everyone still want to be treated equally, of course, this is what the government should do, it is the responsibility to settle fair regulations in this unfair world. 

Many locals argue the this will affect the employment for local americans, maybe it is true, but note that getting a job is far more easy for local people, many of them even don't need to work hard to get a job, expanding the training is just to be more fair. After expanding the training opportunities, the competition between local and international students will be more fierce, this is good for both party, it urge both local and international students to work hard, improve their skills, and finally contribute to the development of technology.

For our STEM students, whether local or international, everyone should try their best to enhance their technical skills, and compete fiercely in a comparatively fair environment, and this policy will help us to create this comparatively fair environment.
