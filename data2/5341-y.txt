Ping Li I am very happy that DHS proposed this new regulation for OPT extension and I undoubtedly believe it is a good thing for both international students and American people. I've heard that some American people claimed that this new rule would result in difficulty finding jobs for Americans and thus this is going to kill America and etc. Of course I cannot agree to it simply because this claim is absolutely emotional and unfair. No one can blame the new OPT extension for not finding jobs! The reason is clearly that the new OPT extension doesn't mean higher chance for international students to get jobs compared to Americans. It is always true that if you're a better fit for the position, you would get the job, despite of presence of the OPT extension. If you cannot get a job, you're not good enough. So any points based on this are vulnerable! Also, we shall have real justice and equality by this new rule of OPT extension. As we know, currently, most of the companies prefer not to hire international students simply because they may not be able to continue working when their OPT expired without getting H1B working visa at that time. Therefore, the companies will have to find and train someone else again, which is a waste of time and money for the whole country other than the companies only. It would be fair by extending OPT to allow international students to have equal job opportunity that they should deserve!
