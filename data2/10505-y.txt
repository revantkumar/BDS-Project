Grace W I think it is a good thing to extend OPT to 24 months, because it will attract more international students come to the USA.

International students come to USA not only pay big amount for tuition fee, but also pay rent, buy car and go on travelling. More important, they dont have credit card and pay all expense one time without any loans! This is a wonderful thing to US economy.

We have to admit that OPT extension revoking in Aug. sent an unwelcome message to all international students, including those on OPT, in collage and prepare to come to the US. Who will come to a place that is so unfriendly even if it offers excellent education? Therefore, they need a confirmation that they are still welcome and will not be hurt here. This is why we need the OPT extension.
