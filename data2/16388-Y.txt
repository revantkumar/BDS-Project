There are certain aspects in the proposed regulation that look/feel like deterrents for the employers to employ international students. Some them are like the requirement of the mentoring and training program that require separate funding. This is feasible for large companies like Ford, GMC, etc. But it is not feasible by smaller companies which would like to employ international students. This will lead to more students converting from their current majors into IT or computer sciences and go to consultancies that work specifically to employ international students. This will further lead to IT and computer sciences jobs being taken from American students and given to others. This trickle down effect will further worsen the situation instead of fixing it.

I think a simpler system which is common for American students and international students would help more students and have a positive umbrella effect. Moreover having a common system would also encourage employers to have equal standards to employ both American and international students. Due to the complex system, I have seen less qualified American peers get the job, I would have been perfect for.

The need of the hour is to have simpler and cheaper system, not a complex and costly system.
