I strongly support this proposal, "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students". My reasons are listed below.

First, expanding training opportunities for F1-Nonimmigrant STEM students (F1-STEM) can greatly boost the U.S. economy. After the 2010 financial crisis, many industries, including the financial industry, were negatively impacted. However, thanks to the high quality employees from the F1-STEM graduates, industries like information technology and mechanical engineering, are rapidly growing and thus increasing the performance of the U.S. markets. Many tech companies have announced that they could not have done this without the extremely intelligent employees from the F1-STEM community.

Second, the training opportunities for F1-STEM students in fact create more jobs are the U.S. citizens. Indeed, due to the fact that many technical jobs are not favored by the U.S. citizens. Many companies had a very difficult time filling in those positions before they meet the F1-STEM employees. By recruiting the F1-STEM graduates, those companies are now able to better grow their business and subsequently expand demands for non-technical positions, i.e. creating more jobs for U.S. citizens.

Third, the cap-gap relief in fact protect the U.S. companies from losing a dramatic amount of money. Many F1-STEM graduates are significantly contributing almost all of the companies. The cap-gap relief can help the companies smooth their work and business without having to wait six months before their F1-STEM can work again.

In summary, "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students" is an extremely important rule for the U.S. It creates more jobs for the U.S. citizens in the long run, protect the U.S. economy, and enable the U.S. become even more powerful in every single domain.
