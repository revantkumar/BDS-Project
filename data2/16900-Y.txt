I fully support this and in fact I think we should let them stay even longer and remove obstacles for companies to sponsor these highly-educated highly-skilled immigrants that provide real value in our economy. If citizens want these jobs, then they should take steps to make themselves qualified, because right now we're educating people from foreign countries, sending them home for no reason, and complaining that there is a shortage of skilled workers.
