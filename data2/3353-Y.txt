I'm an international student, and I was outstanding compared to my peers in my university in China, which is the reason why I was admitted by US University. I come here because I can get a better education here, which will ensure me a bright future. Actually, it not really matter whether I will get a job in the US, because IT companies like Alibaba are also as powerful as Amazon etc. But one thing I really looking forward to live in the US is because US's air is unpolluted, and I like the style of living in America.

I've learnt from the textbook in China that US is a country of immigration, meaning, the majority population are immigrants or their ancestors are immigrants. So that's the reason why America becomes the super power in only 200 years. 

Many people refuse to accept us, even maybe we will just stay for 2 years to earn our tuition back so that we can begin our new life. But their ancestor and themselves are immigrants too. I think it doesn't make sense, and disobey the spirit of America.

I think stopping STEM will threaten American Dream too. If STEM is stopped, many people will give up to believe American Dream.
