I am angry about this new regulation. Companies don't want to hire Americans. They abuse {H-1B} and OPT to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas. The message from this Regulation is that ONLY foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is illusionary. So, I am completely against this new regulation.
