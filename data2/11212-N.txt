As an unemployed, 60 year old Veteran looking for work in my engineering field I find this bureaucratic, side-stepping congress egregious approach to undermine paying work seeking Americans abusive behavior by the current administration for the sole purpose of appeasing rich corporate buddies so they can have the same worker skill level at half the price. This Is very un-American .
