My daughter is a 2011 college graduate with 3 Bachelor's degrees and she only has a part-time job in her field. She is not a protected minority and regularly watches Hispanic, African American, and Oriental women get hired in her place. I would like to see all American citizen college graduates get full-time jobs before giving more incentives to companies to hire part-time to avoid paying benefits or hire non-immegrant students.
