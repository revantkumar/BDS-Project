I SUPPORT this proposal.

A large part of international STEAM students especially PhD students study in US with a fellowship or some other scholarship for many years. When US spend money on these international students, I believe American people would like to find out their money is used in good place: these international students can serve for this country. Thinking of what Singapore government has been doing for past several years: they invite talent student to their universities for free and require them to serve for Singapore for some years after graduation. In US, without OPT extension, most of STEAM students have to go back to their countries and the fellowships and scholarships are spent for nothing but sending a lot of talent young people to other nationals. Therefore, OPT extension is a best way to keep talent young people serving USA right now.

A lot of international STEAM students already have their family in US. They have husbands, wives and children when they are in American. They study in America. They fall in love in America. They have their best moments in America. Their children were born in America. It is so irritating to force them to move out of this land.
