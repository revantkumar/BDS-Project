I strongly support this rule for STEM students with F1 visa. As is known, United States is a country with freedom and equality for US citizens and foreigners. More and more international students want to study in US each year due to high quality of education. This rule not only improves and expands training opportunities for STEM students, but abstract more and more talented students who want to study abroad due to longer OPT. For example, my major is Chemistry which is definitely applied science. That is to say, the students majoring in Chemistry deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. That is the same thing for other STEM majors. I believe US government could give everyone, even if foreigners, equal chance in this aspect. More and more talented students work in US, which will be good for rapid growth of US economy.
