Xiaoxiao Hou I am strongly in favor of the proposal given following reasons:

1) I did my college study in China, and came to Brown University to pursue Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. Brown chose me because I am among the top students on the application list, and have me as a research and teaching assistant will not only facilitate the research in the field of electrical engineering, but also leverage my knowledge to teach the US students, the future generations of this country.

2) With an opt extension, we will definitely be able to contribute more to this country after our graduation, and outside of school. We will use our expertise to create fortune and boost US economy, hence create more job opportunities for the people here. This is a mutually beneficial choice. Talents are the most valuable resources. US have attracted the most talented students here. I cannot think of a reason why US would want to drive them away after providing them with the best education? 

To summary, we are here to learn, to help, to give, to contribute, not to deprive job opportunities of the people here. We look forward to a welcoming attitude through the OPT extension.
