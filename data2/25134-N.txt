I am going to say this in plain words. I am tired of Congress, Homeland Security, Obama and everyone else in Washington working hard to give foreign students what born and bred Americans cannot get - jobs! We already have out-of-this-world immigration, which causes employers to hire these illegals for a smaller wage than an American would (or should!) work for. Now you want to give these students a path to take even more jobs away from Americans! When is enough going to be enough for you people? Listen to the common man and woman in the streets of America! WE want the jobs! WE want the wages! Stop trying to destroy our country by denying us the right to work!
