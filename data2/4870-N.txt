I strongly oppose this initiative due to the following reasons:

The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.
The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers.
Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.
OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.
Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.
OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.
OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.

There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers in the U.S. If that were true, wages for such workers would be accelerating rapidly. They're not; wages for STEM workers have been flat for years. The same cannot be said for revenues for big tech employers. Those have been growing rapidly in recent years.

PLEASE do not continue anymore with any further consideration of this rule or anything like it. Thank you.
