I am personally involved in scientific research projects, which usually have a time span of 2-3 years, or even longer. I would imagine that research and development activities in the industry also take years to achieve the objectives. The 24-month OPT extension will definitely help STEM students like me to focus on our research, rather than worrying about our visa. It will also provide the companies and institutions with a stabler personnel, and hence better consistency for projects and research activities. It is also very unwise to restrict foreign students from contributing to the STEM fields. Development in science and technology is crucial to a country, especially if the U.S. wants to continue taking the lead in technology and the world economy.
