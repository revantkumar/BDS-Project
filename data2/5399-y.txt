Tianshu Ji I think the extension for STEM degree student OPT is very good and beneficial. Nowadays, the STEM talents are needed more than universities graduates. As the technology breakthroughs happen every day in STEM fields, especially in the IT industry. We definitely need international student to help with these innovations. This has nothing to do with citizens unemployment. These STEM jobs are still more than offered and they require high level college graduates, which are not enough by just recruiting US students. At the same time, these jobs are the true breakthroughs and will produce more opportunities for the unemployed people. Just imaging how computers appeared and help millions of people get employed from every level of the society. International students help companies run better and this OPT extension can help them integrate in the companies well too. Therefore, I think highly of the OPT extension.
