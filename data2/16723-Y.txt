I strongly agree with the proposal:
It's good for the US to continue developing and competing with other countries. Technology and science are always the biggest advantages, and OPT extension is most important way for lots of immigrants to contribute for US.
Without OPT extension, less and less talent students would come to this country, and US would become very incompetive to other countries. 
I don't think it would take lots of jobs from US citizens. Since they are only allowed to work for STEM jobs, but most of jobs in US still provide to citizens and they can earn lots of money from that.
If the proposal is rejected, then the talent students would go to other countries.
