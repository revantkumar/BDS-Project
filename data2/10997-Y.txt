I'm studying Economics at UC Berkeley, and I would definitely support this. It's probably true that our economy is doing ok right now, but since our economy is globalized, we will be affected by the Euro zone and China's economic pressure as well. If you compare the economic recovery from gold standard recession before WWI with post WWI, you will find out that the counties recovered very fast before WWI but struggled very hard after WWI. One of the reason is that before WWI, most of the country's government had their economic power in wages, but after WWI governments lost their ability to lower the wages in order to make the economic growth. Letting STEM students work in our country is one of the good way to lower the High Tech labor's wage, which will help our economy today not falling back to a recession or depression. Although it means the people who works in STEM field will lose, I'm not concerning too much about that since they already make a very high wage comparing to the average. However, if there is another recession, we will face a higher unemployment rate, which means thousands hundreds of people will lose their jobs, and they can't make any income. In other words, if we have to choose between taking 10k/year from people who make 100k/year or taking 30k/year from people who only make 30k/year, which choice would you make?
