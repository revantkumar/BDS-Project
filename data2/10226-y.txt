Rafael Tran This new regulation will show that our country are opening our arms to warmly hug international students with STEM skills. It would be a huge loss for our education market if the new policy is declined.

Referring to http://www.iie.org/Services/Project-Atlas/United-States/International-Students-In-US, 886,000 international students came to America to study during the year of 2013-14. Most of them paid their own tuitions. We can see international students in classrooms of different levels, not just college courses and graduate labs. 

I myself have heard stories that, neighborhood high schools are now financially tightly depending on international students' tuitions. These foreign students' parents are willing to pay a lot of money to get their kids educated. The schools can easily tackle funding issue by attracting international students. Once their parents are informed that their children cannot get a long-term job training after graduation, they will stop making education investment in the U.S.

My husband and I accepted a college student from China to homestay with us this year. We are having a wonderful time together. She is basically family now. Yet one day she told me that she's been considering transfer to some Australian university to continue her junior year, because she learned from her fellow students that she no longer enjoys the 29 months of OPT privilege here in the States. This makes think: why wouldn't people in our country be open-minded enough to make these adorable kids feel secure when they pursue a degree here? Our homestay girl is an example. Since she couldn't foresee a stable future here, she was left no choice but quitting her study here. In that way, her college won't profit from those like-minded students' tuitions. This could be a bad news for many American educational institutes, especially private ones.

The girl asked us to comment here. We gladly agreed without a hesitation. Hope our story could speak of its voice.
