The STEM is really important for international students. For many international students who is waiting for H1B and working in the company right now, many students will lose job immediately if the government cancel the STEM extension. Also, the company will be impacted very severely.How could they find people to replace their current employee so soon? How much do they need to pay for this severely influence? It is really important for those company to keep their employee stay in their position.

On the other side, if the government provide 24 months STEM extension,many outstanding international students will have enough time to get working experiences in the US.They will create much more wealth for the country. United States is an open country. American people have generous hearts. I believe this is the reason why the US is the strongest country in the world. However,if this strongest country will reject excellent people from all over the world, who will love to contribute their effort in the future?
