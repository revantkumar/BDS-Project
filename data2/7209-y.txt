Kyle de Beausset It's ridiculous that it isn't easier for students educated here to stay and contribute what they've learned. Worst of all, failure to make it easy I know from experience puts students in a situation where they might fall out of status, putting them and the communities they belong to in difficult positions that shouldn't be. I hope the government does whatever it can to make this process smoother for immigrant students.
