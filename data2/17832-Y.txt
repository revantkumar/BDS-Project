I strongly advocate the OPT program, I know people may have concern that STEM students are competing the jobs, I'm in the pharmaceutical field, I'm a M.S. student with almost 10 scientific papers published in the scientific journals all over the world. I should be very competitive in the job market, however, I got rejected of jobs for several times because I'm not a green card holder, some even after they offer me the job but they cannot sponsor the H1B visas, even if they sponsor the H1B, there will be only thirty percent of chance to get it. The companies in U.S. only select the best international students that are multiple multiple times better than the local candidates, if you still think this OPT thing is unfair.

The world is full of competitions, U.S. citizens immigrate to this country long time ago because it's a country of freedom. If you have capabilities, if you can't even bear this temporary working permit, please try harder to get the job, improve your skills, please do not blame on the external environment, this should not be the excuse for your laziness and your selfish thoughts for the sake of your-self's benefits. Natural selection allows the best species that can fit the environment, U.S. needs the best people to improve the economy, otherwise, there will be more things to worry about in the future for the U.S. if they force the best talented people in the whole world to work for their own country.
