Steve Weicks We have millions of Americans out of work yet we continue to help those who are not citizens of this country, in fact many do not want to be . I have no problem with helping those on the outside once we have helped the Americans on the inside. Those Americans continue to spend money here, pay into the social security, medicare, taxes... the money recycles and helps this country. Until we have fixed our unemployment I am completely against allowing non Americans to take American jobs.
