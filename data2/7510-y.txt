Theresa Jackson International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. This rule will strengthen the relationships between America and other countries. That is, they can share more information, more resources and more opportunities.
