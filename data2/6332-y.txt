Julia Kang I strongly support this rule.
(1)OPT is not for taking job opportunity from native americans (actually native americans under STEM degrees are still easier to find a job than international students),but for international STEM majors'students work legally on open positions which are not filled by US citizens. 

(2)During OPT, most international students work hard, contribute to their employers, and bring huge revenues to the company. The extension of OPT will attract more international students to come to study in US, improve the communications between countries and help to build STEM majors in each universities. Also the tuitions from international students greatly help develop educational facilities. And then, all these will benefit US communities.
