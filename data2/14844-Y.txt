STEM OPT is an absolute necessity for F-1 students. Removing it will have a very adverse effect on international student as well as to the companies employing them. So many eligible and deserving students will have to go back to their home country without having fair chance at employment. I sincerely urge US government to take into consideration the outcomes and re-instate the STEM OPT extension rule.
