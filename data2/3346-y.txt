Hanqi Zhu The STEM OPT extension is a win-win policy. I, as an international student, feel hurt when lots of people in the comment attack the foreigner employees who are creating irreplaceable values for American.

Why do some of the citizens think that the STEM OPT will affect the employment rate? they said so because they don't know the truth. Some of the people are taken advantage of the political propoganda. Frankly, the majors with high unemployment rate are art, sociology and humanity. STEM students with F-1 visa can only do related work in their field. More frankly, why the unemployment rate is high? It's because the economy in U.S. is not good.

Why do some people think if the international students in high-tech field all run away, then the American economy will be better? NO! The fact is,international STEM students are the precious resources who create values. a taxi driver will lose his job when the economy is bad and people have no money to afford a taxi ride. Only if the economy goes better, then people are likely get their job back because others can finally afford the certain services.

Moreover,the fact that cannot be denied is that, U.S. is, and will always be an immigrant country. Citizens, if you can choose someone to be your teammate. Why not choose someone who is smart, strong and young? How HYPOCRITE some of the comments appear to be. Some of you embraced the Hatti children with love and charity and said that we are the world; When you think it may concerns your own benefit, without further thinking, you just jumped out and yelled: "Americans go first". When, does United States, became such a short-eyesighted and selfish country?

Yes, Americans do go first according to the STEM OPT rule. So, why not read the rule carefully before making a comment? Any arbitary claim is unfair to lots of people.
