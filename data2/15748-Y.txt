I don't understand all the intricacies of this issue. I oppose sending all of our work overseas for two reasons: we have people here who need jobs and the labor force in foreign countries is inhumanely. We need to become self-sufficient and have our products sold in other countries. We have millions on welfare. Why not help out businesses by having the welfare people earning their money? A welfare worker could continue to receive welfare while working six months at a company. At that point, the company can assume the role as employer and the person could receive more than if they were still on welfare. I have a nephew who did a stupid thing while of his bipolar meds. He has served his term and been out for several years. No one will hire him. How about our government relieving taxes on businesses that while hire ex-cons? There are so many ways we can make jobs...government and private in concert together?
