I appeal to the USCIS to get this bill approved. The people against this bill think the international students took their jobs. The truth is that if the citizens want to find a job, they will get a job. The citizens who don't work have nothing to do with the job opportunities. They just don't want to work and complain a lot. The approval of this bill will be more beneficial to the economy, definitely no harm to the economy.
