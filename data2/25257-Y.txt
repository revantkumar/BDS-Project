I strongly agree with the arguments in this proposal. Extending STEM OPT to 24 months benefits many international students 

I think its hard to find F1 students to find employment oppurtunities right after graduation since they are completing with other students and experienced candidates. More time should be allotted so they can finish their students and spend 6 months-1 yr trying to look for a job they desire.
