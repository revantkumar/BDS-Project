The current situation in the high tech industry throughout the US is already overrun by foreign nationals flooding our job market with low capability, low pay candidates that keep qualified Americans from fairly completing for the jobs that are available. Large corporations already get government incentives and benefits and for taking advantage of this low cost external labor source at the expense of the Americans that are fully qualified for these positions. This change will further dilute the talent market and drive the reasonable cost for these skills lower and lower. The only winners are Corporate monsters that eagerly sell out American workers for a few more dollars of profit. Government policies should be focused on protecting the American work force rather than facilitating its continued destruction.
