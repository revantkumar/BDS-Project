Dear Chief Westerlund:

I support this proposal strongly, and I have explained why in the paragraphs below, drawing from my own experience as the Vice President of Engineering at a large US technology company based in Silicon Valley, California. Over the last few years, my company has found it difficult to fill STEM positions requiring advanced skills because the US is facing a shortage of qualified STEM graduates. 

As everyone knows, America's competitiveness in the 21st century will be based on how well we can lead in STEM. 
Although the proposed rule is a short term fix, it will help the nation in maintaining our lead in inventions, scientific discovery and engineering innovation in the immediate future, by allowing brilliant foreign-born STEM students to work in the USA. I do believe that we need a long term solution in terms of improving the primary education in the STEM fields in American schools and encouraging more students to study in STEM fields, but that is another matter altogether. 

Some of the most outstanding inventions and patents in my company have been made by foreign born employees who graduated from US Universities in STEM fields. It is inventions such as these that help companies achieve a competitive advantage in a globalized world. We should give such talented STEM employees a way to contribute more for American innovation. I hope you will also consider the tremendous positive impact this proposed rule will have on American companies and innovation while finalizing the future of the STEM OPT program.

Sincerely,
Dr. James Cameron
Mountain View, CA.
