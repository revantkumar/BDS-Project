Jennifer Chuang I support this 17 month OPT extension for F-1 students. I believe this is a great opportunity to offer students a chance to work and contribute their talents to the workplace here in the US. There are many talented and students who are eager to use their skills to succeed in their careers here. This is a win-win situation for both companies and the students. Please consider giving these hard-working students a chance to stay and work in the U.S!
