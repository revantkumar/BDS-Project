Stop helping foreigners and immigrants! I was born in America; both my parents and their parents born in America - no one in my lines are immigrants!

America is now over crowded; we don't need anymore immigrants! We should NOT be spending money on outsiders, unless we have a surplus with no debt! Where is your common sense?

I trained 7 months in Tech, Network Administration and can't get any companies to hire me! I also applied to hundreds of the big companies who receive tax breaks and grant money; they don't hire locals or citizens!

Backwards we have fallen!
