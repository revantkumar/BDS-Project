Yuemin Li I see this is a MUST to have policy, especially now. STEM students are the key to cover the gap the tech area positions. This does not necessary means STEM students would affect the employment situation for current US citizens. In fact, companies are still prefer US citizens cause they do not need to sponsor a citizen thus lower cost. The reason why STEM students are here is for filling up the positions and help US to stay as one of the leading contrary in STEM areas. 

Also, STEM students have spent several years study in US and sharing the education resources. Why not giving them a reasonable time to work for US with what they learned?
