I strongly agree this document approved!!!!! It`s so ridiculous that lots of American said " the American jobs are only for citizens"! If all the international students go back their countries and leave the job opportunities for you, can you hold them? Do you have enough ability and knowledge to work for it??? The only reason you cannot find job is your low ability not because of the foreigners! Lots of American who opposite the policy would never think about the US`s development tendency, they just hope the government leave all the job opportunities for themselves. If the STEM extension is canceled, it would cause a big effect to the US in many fields, such as the amount of international students would be decreased a lot, so the income for the education system would also be reduced, because the International students` tuition is more expensive then the native students, it is the main income for these universities all the time, and some STEM majors such as CS and engineer would also lost competitive power than before. Secondly, so many big technology companies would lost lots of talent people right away! And these position cannot be filled immediately, so it will cause big economic loss for these companies. Finally, I think the OPT students cannot be any effect for the local people, because according to my experiences, I think most of companies would like to employ the American citizens first, actually our international students have very less competitiveness than the American citizens. 

I have to say that the STEM students are very IMPORTANT for the US development, they can do many hard works, which the American or other majors` students cannot do. The STEM students have more computer science, mathematic, database, and analysis knowledge than any other people, so I think their contribution cannot be replaced!!!
