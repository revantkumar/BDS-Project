I support the extension! My friend is running a start-up in NYC with an OPT. If OPT is only allowed one year, he won't be able to continuously creating jobs for the Americans! Many job creators in IT was international students. The government has spent lots of money on educating international students (many of them go to school with full scholarship). We should let them contribute to the society after they get the degree.
