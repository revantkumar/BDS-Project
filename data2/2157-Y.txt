Support, definitely.

1. Those talented guys wherever come from(mostly Asia), who entered top colleges or universities in USA, should and be encouraged to contribute to USA afterwards. Or what? They just learnt a lot and go back to their country, then compete with usWe should make use of those talents, to keep USA better.

2. I know many of them have made us citizens hard making a living. However, that's because history just keeping advancing. The only way for me and you is to study harder, work harder. Why complaints? One who fails the long-term competition is the one roaming the streets later.

3. Admit it that they are good, they are highly educated, they do not commit crimes, they pay a lot taxes. You guys should look in the perspective of grand America, not your tiny insignificant wellbeing.

Don't be a coward! let them in, then be us for US!
