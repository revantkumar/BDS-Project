I am an adjunct Professor at a University in the United States and I SUPPORT this proposal of extending OPT training opportunities to Foreigner students. In the recent years, many programs in my school received many high quality international students, many of them are very talented and they could definitely contribute to our country. So I think it is really important to give them the opportunity to contribute more to the country. 

To those arguments that the international students are competing against citizens for jobs. True, but competition is ever exist. Do you want those talented individuals to stay in the US compete for the job market, delivering value to their US employer or do you want them to go back to their country, working for a foreigner company and competing against our US companies?

It is clear that the OPT extension program is a great method for US to add Human capital in today's very competitive global market.
