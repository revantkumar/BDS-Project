Shirley Shan I'm a phd student in US and i support expanding training opportunities for F1 students. My university supported a large amount of scholarships and tuition waives for the outstanding international students. If they can't contribute to US economy, it's a huge waste in the university's and the government's aspect. And the smart students can contribute to the local economy and technology, and it's also good for the county's cultural diversity.
