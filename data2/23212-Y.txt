To dear staff members working for the Federal Register,
To honored committee experts reviewing the comments and
To all fellow compatriots or foreign friends reading this note:

Thank you very much for taking the time to review this comment. I assure you this will be a brief one with no complicated logical reasoning, no difficult terminologies, and no roundabout implications just some simple facts helping to solve the critical problem: Can our fellow United States citizens get those jobs if we dont allow this 24 months OPT-extension?

Dont forget that there are still currently 1,153,459 current international students! And please note, the absolute majority of those 1,153,459 international students can at least work 1 year with the 12 month OPT, regardless of the Extension.

So what would most likely happen without that extension? Instead of having the same international student A working for 3 consecutive years on the extension program, we have international student A working for 1 year on his 12 months OPT, international student B working for the 2nd year on Bs 12 months then C for 3rd on Cs 12 months.

The fact that there are so many international students in the USA and a relatively
