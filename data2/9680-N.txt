Dear Mr. Obama,
Your chronic, relentless and ruthless campaign to fill this country with foreigners and illegal invaders who will vote Democratic and disadvantage natural-born American workers reveals an extremely ugly bias against hard-working native Americans. Please cease your war against American workers and give us an even chance to compete fairly against the aliens you import by the hundreds of thousands, and clearly prefer so much to the native-born Americans for whom you have so much contempt. You took an oath to be on OUR side.
