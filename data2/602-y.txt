Nagarjun Reddy Gaddam I strongly support OPT extension period suggested for STEM majors. Im glad that duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

The extended period is going to help the international students in many ways. I feel that the benefit and the value of education in US will decline over time if you are stopped from getting the practical training after your education. A period of at least three years is needed to apply what one got from his education and grow out of it. I have started to work on the OPT period and I see that it is very beneficial and it is really good to get more time for the practical training.

I am very concerned with the possibility that the OPT extension period might be disrupted by recent court actions, as these actions doesn't show any good intention and are completely against the immigrant rights and the ethical values of this great country. It is every one's responsibility to give him/her a chance to accomplish what he has dreamed after all working very hard to reach this stage.
