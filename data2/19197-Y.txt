I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. The United State of America is a country of freedom, equality for not only US citizens, but also aspiring young students all over the world. All students deserves equal opportunity and time to practice, to apply their knowledge learned from school.
2. As the trend of the previous shows, skilled STEM students have made huge contribution for US economy. And as the rapid development of IT area, it is no doubt that STEM students will continue to work hard to promote economy.
3. Longer OPT will abstract more students coming to study to US.
