Albert Parr I strongly support the new OPT extension rule.

1. There are many concerns about the new rule will make the native Americans harder to find jobs. On the contrary, it has positive effects for native Americans. The OPT stem rule is mainly targeting on STEM industries, which is one of the most important growing engines of the economy. The OPT program provides so many work forces that meet the needs to make the industries in US growing fast and maintaining its leading position in the world. 

Many opposers only focus on the percentage of employment of native Americans, but omit the fact that the OPT program actually makes the industry growing fast and then provide more employment opportunities that both naive Americans and international students benefits from. 

Without the OPT program, the attractions of high trained workers, talented students will become lower, it will then turn out to slowdown the whole US economies growth, and finally affects the native Americans' jobs opportunities.

2. OPT program can help maintaining the leadership of US in the world, because of it can attract so many talented students all over the world to go to US. The leading position of US is the most important factors to provide more job opportunities for native Americans.

3. OPT program attracts so many students to go to US for studying and practical training, which at the same time help the local economy growing fast since there are huge amount of money going into US.

In conclusion, OPT program is good for both native Americans and international students. And the new rule is really important , I strongly supports it.
