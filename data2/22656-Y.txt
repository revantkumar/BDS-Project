I'm in China and planning to apply for graduate schools abroad. The programs in U.S. seems attractive because students have chance to get hands on experience through OPT. However, 1 year training is somehow too short for science and technology majors since research in those domain requires more time to make achievement. On the other hand, for programs in some Europe countries such as France and Germany students don't have to pay tuitions and are also competitive. Students also have chance to take internships during their study. I think long term OPT can be very important for international student like me to make a decision between the U.S. and European countries.
