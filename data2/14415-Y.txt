I, as an international graduate student in business analytics major, strongly support the proposal of making OPT Extension 24 months.

Firstly, International students in STEM majors contribute heavily to the US economy. We invested hugely into education and have become an crucial factor in boosting the GDP of the US. At rate of $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $80000000000.00). Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment (3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00). If the OPT extension rule is cancelled, then students will go other countries with OPT system, negatively impacting the US economy.

Secondly, international students are the backbone of the US tech sector. With OPT extension rule, employers will be getting the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT ( Ex: BIG DATA in IT, Social Networking, Mobile technology) otherwise relying on obsolete technologies. This will potentially, and obviously, further help the development of the US economy.

Finally, as many citizens point out, foreign students may have an impact on the employment of US workers. However, this impact will mostly likely be positive. Because with the continuous economic development, partially contributed by foreign high-tech workers, there will be more and more job opportunities opened to US citizens. The problem that OPT students are underpaid can very well be resolved by the "training and mentoring program" that's included in this newly proposed rule.
