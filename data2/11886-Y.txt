I strongly agree to expand training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees. The reason might be:
1. Our nation needs more talents to help us develop high technology and compete with Russia or China. Setting barriers to these talents, especially for these students with PhD degree, is unwise. 
2. These students are hard working, USA should give them an equal right to fulfill their values.
