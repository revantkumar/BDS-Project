I strongly support the 24 month STEM OPT rule. Here are my reasons.

First, as an undergraduate in US, I have had spent couple years studying technology related subjects and my other international classmates work really hard to get a good grade as other domestic students and there are not as many domestic students in our classes because STEM courses are way harder than normal courses. We are hoping that we can have three years to train ourselves into a qualified engineer and we could either go back home with better skills or if someone wants (which is only 13% percent of the all H1B applicants), he/she could provide US companies with higher educated knowledge.

Second, one of the reason why so many international students want to come to US for study is that US could provide better education. OPT period is a great time to train students and if a student cannot get the "better education" they want, will students continue to come here? Totally U.S. education can get over 12 billion dollars and if OPT can not provide students what they want, it could be a great finical loss to the U.S. government.

Third, STEM OPT DOES NOT take away job opportunities. OPT is a training program not a working visa. Also, if a international student can really win a job at the end through so many competitions, he/she must be outstanding enough and could contribute to the society.

In all, I strongly support STEM OPT extension and this is the reason why we love this country. It provides opportunities and improvements.
