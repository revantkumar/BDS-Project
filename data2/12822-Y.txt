I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international student from China. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore and British. 
The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. 
In the other side, if there are less foreign students come to US, the much more empty apartments in the whole US, the less employees for properties. The less restaurants need to supply food, the less employees for these restaurants; the less people go to the mall to buy the stuffs like computer, food and clothes, then the less people could be hired. As everyone could see that, the more US people were hired because of international students; the boost of economy of US, because a lot of international students come here, live here and study here. 
If US do not have OPT extension, I believe less international student will choose to study here. Then many much more unemployment rate in US compared the rate of now.
