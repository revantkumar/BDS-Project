There are enough citizen's out of work in the U.S.A. with out creating new visas programs. Programs that will only keep American citizens from getting jobs, while giving any jobs that do open up to foreign workers. Never should American citizens be passed over for jobs, so that foreigners can take those jobs. In my opinion; "all immigration levels need to be brought back to zero for the next ten years, no exceptions. When it comes to illegals, thier should be no stone left unturned to enforce the deportation to thier homelands. Including anchor babies!" Build the Damn FENCE!
