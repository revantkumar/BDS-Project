I vote positively for extension of OPT period for International students. This is in line with American Spirit in which open the door for a bright, multi-cultural and intelligent future.

It will be good to keep the highly intellectual students within American companies. Besides, STEM majored students are not going to be labor-intensive, but knowledge-intensive, which is not only environmentally-friendly (in terms of their quality) for American Industry, but also helpful in the US to keep as the leading country in the world.
