I think the improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 student with STEM Degree is a good action and should be approved.

1.In the US, everyone should has equal rights, which should give every F-1 student equal rights to work.

2.In recently year, technology is big part of US economy. As STEM major students, they have knowledge and capability to work on the technology and contribute to the company, even more to help grow US economy.

3.Extending the time of OPT extension can help these companies which has short projects which the period is around half to 2 years. It gives more change for student to learning, but also it give company more flexible and save money, which they do not need to hire a full-time for the short projects.
