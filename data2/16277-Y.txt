Immigration of skilled workers is the lifeblood of the American superiority. If we cut it, we will only witness the demise of 200 years of distinction and achievement. In the meantime, we would let all the brain power go to other countries which are destined to rival the U.S. in every conceivable aspect. SUPPORT THE OPT STEM EXTENTION AND LET THE BEST AND THE MIST SKILLED STAY IN AMERICA!!

Those who oppose to it are those who sacrifices long term prosperity of the mighty country to short term benefit to themselves.
