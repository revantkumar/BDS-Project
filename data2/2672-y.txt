Nina Li I think this policy is reasonable and can bring benefits to both students and U.S.
The large number of international students in U.S. is stimulating the economy in U.S. The Chinese students in U.S. can bring more than 8 billion dollars income for U.S. everyday. At the same time, international students are paying expensive tuition without any loans from U.S., but Americans now have more than $1,200 billion tuition debt unpaid! If the OPT extension for STEM students is cancelled, less and less international students will come to U.S., and I believe many education institutes will confront serious financial problems. At that time, without the benefits brought by international students, the number of unemployed people will increase with no doubt, and citizens in U.S. will not enjoy large amount of loans for higher education.
We choose America for future study because of OPT extension policy for STEM students. If the extension no longer exists, America will have no advantages in attracting international students, and the number of foreign students will decrease. We want more time to work in America to gain work experience in the world-famous companies, like facebook, Amazon, Yahoo, Google,etc. These companies also need STEM students to help them develop. So the extension policy is win-win, it will be unreasonable to cancel the extension.
