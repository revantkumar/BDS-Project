I strongly support this action with the reasons as follow. First, so far, the students of STEM fields have been occupied by foreign students, so it won't make much difference to the local American's job options since there are few American people willing to major in these fields. Second, this extension will undoubtedly attract student globally to come to USA to further their study, hence it could enhance the reputation of high level education of America. Third, more people coming to America means more economic growth, which is exactly what America needs, and therefore it can create many potential jobs that could completely offset the negative influence,if any, caused the by this extension.
