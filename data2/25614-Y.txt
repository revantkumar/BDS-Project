Dear sir/Madam,

First of all, I would like to appreciate your New rule 24 Months OPT extension, If u vacated the 17 months OPT extension so many international students will be on road with financial problems, and it will be the big remark to the US government. International students contribute their efforts to improve US economy, In my view "24 months of OPT extension won't enough,please extend it to 36 months or more." Extending OPT for STEM graduates will attract so many international students and it will help a lot to the US economy and in other aspects,so please make the rule by considering "24 months OPT extension or more duration".

Thank you for time!
