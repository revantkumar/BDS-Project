According to the CDC data, more than one-third (34.9% or 78.6 million) of U.S. adults are obese, and obesity-related conditions include cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The medical cost resulting from obesity was $147 billion in 2008, and the cost for patients with obesity were $1,429 higher than those with healthy weight. Additionally, there is a trend of increasing overweight/obesity in young kids and adolescents, which will contribute to higher medical cost and more severe health issues in their later lifetime. 

While there is an increasing public awareness of the importance of healthy diet on the prevention and treatment of the above diseases, there is also an increasing demand for nutritional professionalisms. The two professional credentials in nutrition field are Registered Dietitian (RD) and Dietetic Technician, Registered (DTR). Based on the statistic of the Commission on Dietetic Registration, the credentialing agency for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the total number of RD and DTR was 89,300 and 5,106, respectively. There is a huge discrepancy regarding the demand and availability of nutritional professionalisms. 

As one of the STEM programs, students graduated from nutritional program would be able to provide nutritional service in clinical nutrition field, where they would prescribe medical nutrition therapy to alleviate the patients suffering from obesity related diseases. Moreover, increasing professionalisms in other fields, such as school nutrition, community nutrition, and nutrition counseling, would be helpful in enhancing the publics knowledge of nutrition, which would be further beneficial to decrease the rate of obesity and related diseases overall, thus reducing the medical cost and financial burden of individuals and the country.
