This is a very GREAT decision! I strongly support it!

As a H1B employee, I know very well how OPT Extension can help international students and every industry in American.

1. All international students come to the USA with various backgrounds, they can bring great opinions and interesting thinkings to American companies. I am working with people from different countries every single day, and they always surprise me with their great thoughts. Because of OPT extension, we can all work very hard in this awesome company and trying to do some excellent thing everyday. 

2. American is an immigration country. The reason why it becomes the most powerful country in this world is because American values freedom and equality. People are not judged by their race, gender, sex orientation and etc. Every people has the opportunity to share their great talent. OPT extension is a great way to help young and promising students to develop their skills and to improve this great country.

3. Also, OPT extension can bring positive competition to job market. Everyone will try to be much better at their field. This is very important for companies to find the best talent.
