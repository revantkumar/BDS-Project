Janice Eitelgeorge, Ph.D. As a professor, I see the inflated GPAs of foreign students and thoroughly disagree with the scholarships and free education they receive. American students are being discriminated in all sectors. Support Americans and do not expand the F-1 STEM for foreign students. The job market for Americans is slim.
