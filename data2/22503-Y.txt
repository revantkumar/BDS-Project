I deeply OPPOSE this new proposal! BECAUSE F-1 Visa HOLDERS ARE BREAKING LAWS AT THE FIRST DAY OF THEIR OPT!!!!!!!!!!
As an American regulation maker, how dare you make such a policy to make high-tech US Citizen in a vulnerable situation and even making it WORSE!

1) this proposal will keep foreigner over those diligent & smart US citizens worker. From my 12 years working experience, most of American workers shown better performance and more progressive. Americans commit their whole life to their company while Foreigners are unstable in their career path. 

2) As far as I know, most of F-1 visa holder don't have legal status to stay in US after 60 days of graduation. From what they said, they usually volunteer on campus positions, which doesn't exist at all! They are technically OUTLAWS before they have a full-time job. Why are you giving F-1 Visa holder OPT? THEY ARE BREAKING LAWS WHEN THEY JUST GRADUATE!!!!!

Stop this proposal before it's too late!
