I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL FOR REASONS BELOW:
1.the government let the students to gain knowledge from university, it is best to let the student to use these knowledge to contribute to US, not contribute to other country.
2. Diversity is very important to US, and many great scientists, engineers, and enterpreuner are from international students.
3.US industry need international students, because they can not find so many engineers from US citizens, and hiring different people will keep the company more competitive and make US more competitive in the world.
