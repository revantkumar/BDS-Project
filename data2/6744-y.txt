Patrick Gao I am a software developer working for United State of Department of Agriculture (USDA), responsible for the information system enhancement and maintenance. From my point of view, both US companies and US colleges will benefit from this proposal. 

OPT STEM allows US employers to hire talented people worldwide with reasonable pay - this is what makes US companies competitive in the global economy for the past years. In the IT industry, most software projects take 3+ years to enhance and maintain after development. So it would be beneficial if the OPT STEM program gives international students a 2-3 years extension. 

The OPT STEM proposal also benefits US colleagues. With OPT and OPT extension, international students get chances to get industry experience, which is one of incentives they chose US colleagues other than UK, Australia or Canada. The tuition fee, living expend, rent from those international students also contribute to US economy. 

In addition, I noticed that many international degree holders complete their degree with scholarship - which means US governments and colleges invest money to encourage those talented people work for US academic research or industry companies. It is a big loss if they just go back to their homeland after finishing their degree. 

For the reasons mentioned above. I strongly recommend this proposal.
