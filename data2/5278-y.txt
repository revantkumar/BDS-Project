Qi Chai I don't understand why someone says the government is spending his tax dollars on the OPT training program??? During the OPT, international students should feed themselves, no one is giving money to these poor students, they should earn money by themselves. 
But during OPT, they absolutely will spend their own money on housing, travelling, food, entertainment, education in the US, which has brought Americans tons of jobs. Americans should know those international STEM students are not only the most talented students in the world but also the richest group of people from their own countries. 

Without the OPT extension, Americans will lose tons of jobs!
