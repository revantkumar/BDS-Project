Tracy C I strongly SUPPORT the expanding OPT for F1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees. The government should allow the F1 students majoring in STEM to stay in the United States for a longer time so that these students could make contributes to United States after they learned technology here. It is an passed policy for the government to allow the F1 students to work in U.S after graduation, the special request for STEM majors because thesis area require much higher qualification and specific technologies so that there even not enough quailed U.S citizens to be hired. Beside, the longer period is necessary because works in STEM are always complicated and no way to be a fast and short-time period. A nine-month OPT period might only able to let the beginner to start so that if the government looks forwards the contribution from the F1 students in STEM other than only teaching them knowledge, they should gave a reasonable longer OPT period. Besides, there is no reason that the U.S citizens afraid of this kind of completion. OPT is not a kind of immigration, it just for a short-time working permits and restricted to the major-related area by law. There is no chance for the student to invade the citizens opportunities.
