Piyush Lohana I take privilege in providing my view about the STEM Extension Rule. 

I strongly support the STEM Extension proposal. With a shortage qualified candidates in every sector, it is imperative that STEM extension gets approved so the professional from around the world can continue to work here in USA, contributing to its economy, development and mutual growth.
