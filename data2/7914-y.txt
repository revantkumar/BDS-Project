Sheng Yang I support the new policy of OPT extension and hope it can be extended to 36 months. Students with STEM Degrees do not result in local ordinary people losing jobs. These students almost will enter technology companies which strongly need technical talents to help their development. And these posts are not suitable for ordinary people who have not necessary study and technique. Without a large number of outstanding Chinese and Indian students who major in Computer Science, many companies in America like Google and Amazon will not have such development. When those companies become more and more powerful, they will employ more and more ordinary local people and promote employment.
