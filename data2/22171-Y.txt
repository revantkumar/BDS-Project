I support this extension of OPT.

Some people think that when the new rules apply they will lose their jobs or get no jobs at all. But these people don't see how the OPT students create jobs. 

I am living in a small town where the university only has hundreds of international students around 2002. The town began to prosper after the university brings more students for STEM degrees and most of which are international students. Every year some of these students run into the local electric power company for their practical training. Now they are growing the business into the neighbor states - a local small company becomes one that is able to provide almost one thousand jobs nationwide. The big changes also happen to other local business such as construction industry and agriculture because the fresh graduate F-1 students are invigorating the local market. That is to say OPT extension can help F-1 students to create more jobs.
