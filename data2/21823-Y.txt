I strongly support the proposal. 
Competition does exist, but diversity is very important to the U.S. New immigrants, especially international students, are making huge contributions to the country. Report shows that Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010. Moreover, these international students have never done anything related to lowing salary. In fact, international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level, and at the same time, the employees need to make extra payments to help their international employers to get the visa and settle down. In fact, the local have salary advantage instead.
