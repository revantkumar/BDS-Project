Being an F-1 student,I am currently on my post completion OPT which will expires in May.This rule is very helpful for the students like me.We left our home country to serve the other country and feel like home here.Now this country in result of that getting us out of their country which is very bad for our future and career.

I really appreciate the DHS who implemented this rule and gave us the chance to proove ourselves and serve with more enthausiam as the new training and mentorship will help us to explore more things and get to know the hidden talent inside.

Its very much kind of the DHS if this rule will built for us.
