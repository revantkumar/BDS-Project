Kush Patel I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. The STEM extension would provide international students with an ample opportunity to fully develop their skills earned in college. Moreover, these skills will benefit businesses in the US that are in need of highly skilled labor in STEM disciplines. The STEM extension will thereby create a win-win situation where the international students are able to get their dream jobs while simultaneously enabling the US to maintain its competitive edge in the world in STEM fields.
