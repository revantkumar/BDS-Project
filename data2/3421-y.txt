Hiral Jhaveri Increasing the OPT time for international students will attract more international students to US. This benefits not only the students themselves but also the US economy as a whole. A lot of top notch talent among the whole of US industry comes from foreign grounds and if they are forced to leave early, it will neither make sense for them nor will help the economy, in fact, it would hamper it. So, I strongly support for increasing the OPT time.

I would also urge to increase the quota of H1B allowing more students the opportunity to serve themselves and thereby the country as a whole.
