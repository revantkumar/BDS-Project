This is a great proposal, I fully support it. 
Findings highlight an alarming shortage of skills affecting key jobs in the US economy, and point to a vital need to improve the level of training provision offered to those working within STEM industries.

STEM skills underpin many of the industries at the forefront of our economy, from world leading engineering to cutting edge information technology, yet our findings also show some evidence that those working in high level STEM roles are less likely than most to receive training.

There is a vital need for employers to act now to secure a steady flow of talent with the right skills in years to come: building more structured training and development schemes and developing clear career pathways are just two ways in which early action can avert future crises.

The research also brings to light the range of sectors dependent on STEM skills, with almost half (46%) of graduates working in innovative firms in manufacturing and knowledge-intensive business service industries having a degree in a STEM subject.

STEM skills also play a vital role in a range of other sectors, including specialized manufacturing, research and development and technical consultancy, as well as underpinning crucial technological areas including computer programming.
