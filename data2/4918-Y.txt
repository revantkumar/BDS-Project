Let this proposal pass!

If this proposal does not pass this time, it will next year; if that doesn't happen, then the year next that! Not long before you fellow Americans realize you need us, international STEM new grads.

It is a good thing to bring brilliant people around the world to US and compete with each other, I think this is exact the reason why America thrived since WWII. Albert Einstein, John Von Neumann were not American when they were born; they were two of millions of immigrants. Think about the world will be without them on the side of United States.

We make the job market in US more intense and fierce, and let's face it, United States needs its job market intense and fierce, that's how economy grows. True story ;)
