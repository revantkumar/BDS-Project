I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. 
On one side, US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. Also, those students who will benefit from this rule are already hired. They will pay more income tax than the majority. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here.
For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.
