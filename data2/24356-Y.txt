I happened to see the comment from Marion A and Thomas Hill Conroe, TX. They yelled "Quit spending the money!!! we do not need to fund anybody's degree". I am afraid these two Texas guys do not read news about foreign students but only live in their own imaginations. My dear Texan Mr. and Mrs. Conroe, please search in google to check how much economical benefit that those F-1 students bring to us. It is not in millions but in billions of dollars a year with tens of thousands of related U.S. jobs! We are not paying their tuition. They are paying their tuition themselves and what is more, in a much higher price than any in-state student. My dear Texan Mr. and Mrs. Conroe, if you want to send your boys to college by having reduced tuition, you should support those lovely international students because they are currently funding the state education which makes it possible for your boys to enjoy a very low in-state tuition. The tuition will roar without these rich international students. 

Yours sincerely,

Someone not from TX
