I strongly support this proposal. Even though I have the green card. But I think there should be some opportunities for the talented people who want to make contribution to the U.S.. This fits the mutual benefits for both the U.S. and the STEM students. The international can practice their professional skills and the American companies can also have qualified expertise to work for them.
