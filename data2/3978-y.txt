Gabriel Ye It takes at least ten years to train a potential young people to be a qualified a doctor. It also will spend a lot of resources in this process. Remember, not all people have these potentials. And all these potentials keep the United States the most powerful country in the world. STEM opt project will allow the United States to keep all these qualified doctors and make these doctors work for the United States. ThereforeI highly support STEM Opt program.
