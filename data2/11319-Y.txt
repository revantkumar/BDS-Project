We all known that America is a multi-culture country. And the most attractive thing in this great country is fair. Even though I am a international student, I have a american dream. I believe I can find a job here, I believe I can realize my american dream without any discriminatiin and unfair treatment! That's why I strongly want this proposal to be approved.
