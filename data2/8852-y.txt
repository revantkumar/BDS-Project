Pice Chen I support the new rule for OPT extension. Our country has been the most powerful country because we lead the world in many aspects of science and technology. The most effective way to keep advancing science and converting new founding into innovative technology is through competition. We should give foreign students with STEM degrees extended opportunities to work in US. Let this competition continue to drive new inventions. Let our economics continue to thrive.
