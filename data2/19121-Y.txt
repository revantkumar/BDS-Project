I totally support the new extension rule. This gonna benefit American education. Longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study here.and help to ensure that the US academic sector can remain competitive globally ! Countries such as United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Taiwan and China are currently actively instituting new regulations and strategies to attract international students. For say, Canada also acknowledges that educational institutions need international students to compete in the "global race for research talent In April, 2008 , Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to let post-graduate student stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for up to three years. As a student , the reason why I choose US to study in, all because the OPT program could help me accumulate practical experience, without OPT program , I wouldnt choose to come here. And in my perspective, most students share the same thoughts as I . Without OPT program , the US higher education would loss its attraction and loss foreign Stem talents to contribute their knowledge to this country . Its definitely a huge disaster to high-tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Intel etc
