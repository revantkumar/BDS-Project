I really think for students who want to improve and gain hands on experience on STEM fields, it's really not fair to make them compete with other work visas to gain the experience in their field of study. 24 months extension gives them ample time to gain exposure to market needs in their fields so that they have a clear idea about how to pursue their career. I completely welcome this rule.
