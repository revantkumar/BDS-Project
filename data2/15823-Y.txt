I am a restaurant owner in the Westwood village near UCLA. I saw an international student boost since 2009, more and more foreign students, especially Asian students, came to mine and it did help my business. They are polite and generous, and I do like them. Imagine, if the policy is gonna be cancelled, our country might be less attractive to them and that's not a good thing for us small business owners.
