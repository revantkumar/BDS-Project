Although it is still true that an American education is the envy of most of the world, a reasonable 12 month period of practice is the most that these foreign students should be allowed. They have received the education, and it is important that they take their education back to their respective countries and improve that culture. We are much more able to extend help to other countries through their own citizens than to absorb these outside students into our country and send money away from our own economy. Educating them is a great thing but extending the training time is not to our benefit.
