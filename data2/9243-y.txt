Dee Young Calling off the OPT extension for STEM students could possibly benefit any other countries in the world except the US, especially those countries facing the problem of a loss of talents (because lots of talented people decided to work in the US!). Recent years, these countries mentioned above, like Russia, China, India, are trying everything they could to get those people back by offering high salary, housing benefit, etc. So we can imaging those governments would be more than happy to see numbers of talented STEM students returning to their home country because they can't work in the US anymore. And this, doubtlessly, would be driving the technical and economical growth in these countries, which would in turn put them on a more competitive edge in international trade and affairs. So, if the US government decided to ban the OPT extension, go ahead, and gradually, US will lose its edge in global competition.
