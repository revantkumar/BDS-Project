This is a fairly reasonable proposed change which will allow bright students in the field of STEM to contribute in a much more effective way to the american society. Of many advantages, I foresee a situation where this proposed change will allow students in STEM to finish any research project that already has been started by them and establish a future line of research which in turn can create more jobs.
