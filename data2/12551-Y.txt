I completely support this proposal. 

The biggest problem is that Americas need these students. So why don't let them stay longer to help US citizens improve the development together?

International students in the fields of STEM are strongly needed in America. Everyone has his/her strengths. For most international students from China or India, they grow up to be very good at engineer study, but weak in the arts field. 

Society could get the biggest development only when every position could find employees with the largest ability. STEM international students didn't mean to take the job opportunities from US citizens, they are just more good at these work. There are also lots of work needing US students. So no conflict actually.

I would appreciate so much if my words could be considered seriously. I truly wish that America could have a better development in the future.
