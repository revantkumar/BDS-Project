International students who are working here in the United States after graduation are making efforts to US economy as well as US citizens. Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering,etc, these disciplines are what most international students are learning while few America students are learning. But the job demand is very high in these areas that only US students cannot meet this demand definitely. So international students are not competing with American students, instead we are working together to build this country and make it better. International students are not the enemy of US workers, in fact international students are the supplement in the workforce.

I am a mechanical engineering student from China and now working for a Japanese automotive company. My colleagues are from Japan, Turkey, China and US. We together are working in this industry. Without STEM extension, a lot of international students will lose chance to work here. But the positions will be very hard to be filled in without students because the work market is really huge but American engineers are not that many. So it may impact US economy in the end. And nobody wants to see that being real. 

I hope we international students could get the STEM extension so that we could have more opportunities to stay and work here. We are not coming here to take over American people's jobs. We are here to work with everyone to make this country and the world much better.
