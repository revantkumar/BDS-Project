Siqi Fan I will not give up this opportunity to fight for my right in this policy, because I have already GAVE UP a lot. I gave up the great job offer in my country, where I could have better life environment than most people around me, and I left home far away from my family with their support, that my parents earned with the greater part of their life, and the expectation, that their son could achieve a higher goal and honor for the family. 

On the personal level, I expect the reward of what I paid for, and expect my efforts will produce a higher personal achievement. On the community level, thousands of students come to US each year, not because life here is easy, but because it is hard. Because this goal, will serve to organize and measure the best of US's resource and technology, because this challenge is the one that everybody will be benefit from the contribution of excellent STEM students to this country.

I do not understand and do not agree with those opponents who just yell rather than work hard for what they want. It is free to speak in the US, but it does not mean everything is free. Indeed, Asians are working harder than many native students, which gives people pressures, but cutting down chances and opportunities of international students will not reduce the stress. Obviously, kicking out good apples does not make the rest sweeter.

Expanding OPT will motivate the whole country, and only competitions can make things progressive again.
More opportunities to STEM means more chances to this country, and more chances will derive more jobs. Therefore, besides supporting this policy, I also expect policies to support international students making startup business, creating job opportunities for the US, that is when local people will support us, and make better life together.
