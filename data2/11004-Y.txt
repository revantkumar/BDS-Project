I am in favor of this policy. From my point of view, America should equally treat all the overseas students. America symbolizes freedom, democracy and opportunity. That's why people who want to improve their education and prompt their career want to study in the United States. I hope American government will extend the OPT so that all the overseas students can achieve their goals in America! Therefore, it's a good way to boost the economy of America since they could have an opportunity to work in America! It's a win win outcome!
