As a current OPT holder, I strongly support the proposal. I believe the 24-month OPT STEM extension will provide enough time for foreign students to be incorporated into the US workforce, and contribute to the science and technology in the industry and academia. 

As a matter of fact, OPT holders are highly-educated professionals working on science and technology-focused areas. OPT holders are not competitors to American working-class people. Besides, the OPT holders provide part of the mind-power behind the inventions and technological products that all people in the USA and everywhere else in the world would benefit from. In addition, there are examples that previous OPT holders have started businesses in the USA, contributed to the US economy and hired American citizens. So, I believe the new proposal will benefit not only the OPT holder, but the American society as a whole.
