xiangyu wang I strongly support the rules of OPT extension for the following reasons:
1) We are all talented students and get our degrees in the united states. We can contribute more to the US economy. 
2) Equity and fairness are the most valuable American spirits worth to be respected by the whole world. As a student who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation
3) Longer OPT will benefits the US education.
4)The canceling of OPT extension may let many students who plan to go to US give up.
