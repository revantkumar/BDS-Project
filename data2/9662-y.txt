Khaled Abdelhalim I support the new revisions and extending the OPT period for a total of 24 months however I find the E-Verify requirement to be of great limitation to the potential of the program.
I can't find a logical reason to propose an employment verification requirement for the extension period but not the regular OPT period. It should be either applied to the whole program or waived as a requirement. After earning my Master's degree, I worked for the City of Seattle and had to resign since the City is not enrolled in E-Verify nor does it have policies enabling employee sponsorships.
I find this requirement an unnecessary burden. I was working for a Municipal entity and helping in capital improvement projects and now all I care about is finding an E-verify enrolled company. I hope this requirement can be adjusted to encompass more employers, rather than just the enrolled firms. Waiver conditions could be added under certain circumstances or other alternatives of employment verification could be used.
