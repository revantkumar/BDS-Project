Steve Kast I strongly support for the proposal to improve and expand the training opportunities for F-1 Students with STEM Degrees and Cap_Gap Relief for all F-1 students. There are several reasons:
1. Most of the students don't intend to immigrant to US, which can be seen in their visa application. They just want to hone their skills in the US, after al,l the US is leading in many areas in STEM, so it will be great for their careers after going back. So this proposal will not affect much about the immigration policy. 
2. It's the sprit of the US that everyone should be treated equally, so everyone should have the opportunities to pursue a job here. We need the American dreams to drive the US, we need more and more passionate F-1 students to work for the US.
3. Although some people argue that F-1 students steal the jobs of the US citizens, while most of the STEM students take the jobs in STEM related areas. Most of the citizens don't like the job in these areas, we need those innovative international students. So they don't steal the jobs but fill in what we are lacked of. 

So I strongly support that proposal, and hope it can make a better future for both the US and the F-1 students.
