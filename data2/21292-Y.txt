I totally support the act that Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

I reviewed 20+ negative comments towards this act, however, none of them make sense. Most negative comments indicate that the international students steal jobs from Americans and allowing international students to work within STEM industry will harm the employment environment, which is ridiculous. Contrarily, restricting international students in STEM work in US, which is the withdraw of expanding training opportunities act here, will harm American employment environment or even resulting in its collapse. The reasons are stated as follows.

Firstly, we all know that there are far less not only American students with STEM major but also Americans with STEM related experience compared to the STEM industry demands. Those STEM related companies have no choice but recruit the international students. 

Furthermore, the identity of international students will not help those international students gain extra advantage against Americans. On the contrary, it is a huge disadvantage for international students. However, why there are still lots of companies recruit international students? It is because there are NOT ENOUGH qualified Americans!

In a word, it is precisely pinpointed the flaws in the negative comments. I am totally support that Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.
