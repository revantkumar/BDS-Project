Truth is, most Americans don't qualify for high-tech jobs. It's not a claim, but a fact.
Our primary education system is designed in such a way that it overlooks the critical skills relevant to high-tech industry, namely quantitative skills. Where do we go for strong quantitative-minded prospectives? You guessed it, countries with intensive primary educational systems like India, China, Japan, Singapore, etc...
If denied OPT, American hi-tech industry will become hollowed irrevocably. And our competing countries will take our advantage.
Lastly, giving intl. students OPT's will free ourselves and American students from the drudgery that characterizes those scutwork we toss out to them. We will continue to enjoy high living standards.
I am all for the OPT extension.
