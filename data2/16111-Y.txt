I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 
Firstly, there are many options for international students to pursue their master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. With OPT extension US can provide them the industry training opportunity during school and after graduation. OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this rule, I don't think US can attract so many foreign students.

Secondly, I am working as a Software developer at one of the high-tech company in Silicon valley. Based on my work experience, most large development projects would last at least 6 quarters or more. Without OPT extension, we would see many talented colleagues have to leave US, which would be a disaster to US high-tech companies.

Thirdly, with OPT extension, international students can apply their knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech company development. 

Fourthly, as from my work experience, many low level positions in high-tech companies are taken by international new graduates. They are hard-working, diligent, and are contributing lot to our technology development. If opt extension get cancelled, it would be a disaster for most big companies, like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon.
