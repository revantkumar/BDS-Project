I strongly support this proposed extension for obvious reason: 
the core strength of current and future US economy depends on the technology innovation which is driven by the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Leading technology innovation in every aspects of human life is the fundamental reason why US is the most competitive country in the world today. The extended OPT session will keep STEM students with advanced degree stay in US a few more years to contribute their knowledge and expertise. It will not only benefit the students themselves, but also the large percentage US tech company who need them most. It will be unwise to have the students learn most advanced STEM knowledge, but don't give them enough opportunities to use these knowledge to contribute the growth of US economy.
