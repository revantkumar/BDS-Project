B Wenke Regarding the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program. I oppose this program and, in particular, any expansion for the following reasons:

1 It has never been approved by Congress. 2. Any expansion will further erode jobs available laid off STEM US Citizens. We have millions out of work and by allowing more OPT STEM students, the crises will be exacerbated. 3. We already have too many visa overstays and this will permit even more. 4. Lastly, it's corporate welfare, with no payment of payroll taxes or Social Security.

With this in mind:

1. Why is this expansion being promoted?
2 Please state the statutory authority for this program as well as the Congressionally approved funding sources.
3. Why is this program being advanced in lieu of trying to promote current US citizens, especially the unemployed who may be well qualified.
4. What guarantees is there that OPT students will displace even more US citizens like which has happened at Disney.

Your answers would be greatly appreciated.
