Marico Lau I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for following reasons:

As a STEM international student, OPT is an essential way for us to get work experience in US, somebody may think it may harm the local workers' benefits, however, opt just provides students a way to apply what they learn to the real industry. STEM is major power for US to develop the newest technology and get a good status in international competition. Experience in STEM needs more time to accumulate, that's why the old OPT policy gave us a chance to extend OPT time. 
Competition does exist, but usually when a company couldn't find a proper local students or workers, it has to hire a international student. There are so many great engineers in US who were international students before. If without the OPT extension, it will be hard for them to go on their career in US, which may induce them return their home country. That's not what the US higher education want to see. People got good skills and talents in US, but US couldn't take advantage of them, It seems ridiculous.

Admittedly, this policy couldn't be perfect for everyone, but undeniable, it's more positive to keep it for US's economy and future days.
