Chaitanya Gondela I strongly agree the proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I Love contributing to Innovation and American Economy. I love the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
