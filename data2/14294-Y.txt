extending opt stem is very much needed for us coming from outside USA so that we can have some time to get needed skills to sustain today after completing education and if the time of stem extension is more so that we can get time to get skills what we need to be in this sector and work without having a question in mind that what we have to do next after this and repay our debts back which we took to complete education and personal expenses while we stay here we spend thousands of dollars here to complete education if we don't have time to repay them we end up with having no hope in life and time we put into this will be not spent well to get better life in future which makes to think we can't settle early and doing masters here will not help to have good future.
