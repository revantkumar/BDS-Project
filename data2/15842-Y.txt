I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 

1. There are thousands of international students get their jobs at IT company, they are brilliant and have high educational background, but only 50% of them can get H1B visa every year. If the OPT extension is canceled, the rest of these people will have to leave America immediately. This will be a significant lose to American economy. 

2. The U.S. consists of immigrants from the old and most of them made a huge contributions to this country. For example, lots of people came to America during The Second World War, most of them are professionals, engineers and scientists (Albert Einstein is one of them). This is why American developed so rapid and strong after the war. The STEM OPT extension rule is right to keep these American future elites.
