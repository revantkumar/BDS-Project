To Whom It May Concern, 

I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program 
and so should you. This expansion would actually provide an incentive to U.S. tech companies by allowing them to hire 
foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. 
Then there is the extremely strong possibility that these companies will only offer below market wages to these students which 
will further depress wages in the tech fields for American citizens - are we deliberately trying to wipe out working Americans?
Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it 
also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their 
degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to 
hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. Take the proper action, refuse to implement this plan and allow Congress to properly 
establish and monitor programs such as this like the H-1b visa program.
