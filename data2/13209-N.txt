American citizens SHOULD take priority over foreign STEM students/employees. IF there are positions that cannot be filled by American citizens, then and only then should foreign persons be considered. Statistics show there are many, qualified American citizens to fill those STEM jobs, many of whom are unemployed. It cannot always be about the money and sneaking around the rules to import foreign workers and then pay them less. IF the point is to make/keep America great, it is imperative that citizens who embrace the American way, have paid their dues and are qualified, be the first considered and employed.
