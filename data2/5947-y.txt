Amtul Rafia I strongly support the OPT STEM EXT and believe that the extension should be given for a longer period which is 24 months plus 12 months of initial OPT. 
The reason being that the students who come to USA spend thousand of dollars almost thrice of the amount spent by the locals on education to gain not only USA degree but also want to gain real time experience so that when they go back to their home country they have a value for their degree asking with the industry experience. 
If the students are given only 12 months of OPT then no company would like to spend their valuable time on employees who can work for them only for a year and leave them. Companies look for candidates who can work for them for a longer period which will help both the company and also the candidates in shaping their career. If the OPT is only for 12 months it will be hard for students to find a job in their field and end up being unemployed.

Therefore in order for the students to gain good experience which will help them after going back to their home country and also for the companies to retain good employees they need to have employees who can work for a longer period for the betterment of their companies the OPT stem EXT should be increased to 24 months issued of 17months. The total of 36 months will have benefits for both the USA companies and the students. Hence I strongly support the rule of OPT stem Ext to a longer period which is 24 months + 12 months of OPT.
