I support this rule. OPT is only a temporary practice for students after their graduation. It doesn't mean people with extended period of OPT will choose to stay here for actual working visa. Many people I know they just want to get some 2-3 years working experience after graduation and then go back to their countries. The ruling only helps the process. It does not change the H visa for formal working capped by congress.
