I support the policy of OPT extension.

1. The main concern of this policy is that it would affect the job market in US. However, most of jobs in US are non high-tech jobs, and one of the main factor that affects those jobs are illegal immigrants. Since OPT only allows students to take positions related to their majors, the students cannot compete with US citizens in the traditional job markets, and some technology department only need citizenship. 

2. The OPT extension policy will help the high tech industry grows faster. Actually, there are many positions in demand that cannot be fully filled by US citizens. One example is data scientist, and the greatest advantage of US is that US can fully take advantage of diversity of talents.

3. Internation students help local economy grow. According to reports available through NAFSA (Association of International Educations) it has been estimated that international students and their families have contributed $26.8 Billion to the US economy and created or supported 340,000 jobs during the 2013-2014 academic year.
