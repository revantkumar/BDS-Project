Gary Boucher I strongly support this rule. As a hiring manager at an IT company at Austin, TX, I have hired a handful of talented international graduates from UT Austin. They started working using their OPT and moved on to a working visa. They have done a great job working here at our company. Without OPT extension, they would have a smaller chance of getting a working visa to stay at our company. Speaking out of my own experience, OPT and its extension rule are very valuable to keep excellent international students to stay at the US.
