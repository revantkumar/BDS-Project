Ed Carmody This is a terrible decision. We have too many STEM students that are US citizens that cant find work. Additionally, this program gives US companies incentives to hire foreign workers instead of US workers. This does not help our economy or US workers. The recent example of Disney firing US workers and replacing them with foreign STEM workers shows the problems with this type of program. Do not follow through with this idea.
