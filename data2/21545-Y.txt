It's unfair and unwise to limit STEM students working in the USA.
Most students studying in STEM are well educated. They are excellent and have very strong mathematics and engineering background that American is lack of. Attracting such students and to provide opportunities for them help the USA to develop and keep strong advantages in IT, engineering and science fields. We have many bankers, don't we need engineerings and scientists? Or how to support Wallstreet?
What's more, who knows which of these students is not the next Jobs or Einstein?
