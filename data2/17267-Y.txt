Compensation and wages have always been a topic of concern for the international students. Lack of specific data on average/prevailing compensation in the specific field is sometimes use by employers to set their own "best practice" compensation rates which are usually different from what the other workers from US receive. There should be some way to clearly set the minimum houly/average annual wages for all workers on OPT. At the minimum, setting minimum wages based on all CIP codes would be helpful using which, the salary and wages can be negotiated.
