I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

STOP the bullshit and madness.
WE the PEOPLE are our Government. VOTE out those career politicians. Time to take back America.

WE the PEOPLE pay taxes. WE the PEOPLE enlist to defend and die for America.

NOT Politicians.

Time to get mad. Time to get even.

VOTE for those who love America. Just because you're a Washington insider, does not mean you love America. EXAMPLES: John Boehner, John McCain. Jim Ryan, John Cornyn, Bernie Sanders, Harry Reid, Nancy Peloisi and BARACK and MICHELLE OBAMA!
