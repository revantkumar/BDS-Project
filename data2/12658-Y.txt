I will undoubtedly support this policy.

I have seen people who claim that by the STEM extension, these internationals are taking the job positions, which are supposed to be taken by citizens. However, they are narrow-sighted to be only able to see the jobs taken, but do not see all the new job positions by these international people.

Go to California and see it for yourself. With so many international students, especially people from STEM fields, we are seeing a booming economy. The internationals are helping create job positions in direct and indirect ways.

1. In California, we see so many international entrepreneurs and so many startups led by internationals. They are opening companies and thus opening more job positions. If you are evicting these excellent people, you are basically depriving the local people of all the job positions created by these internationals.
2. Restaurants, hotels, grocery stores and many other shops are opened in local communities because of the growing number of internationals. I cannot imagine how these shops are going to stand without all the support from the internationals.

People have been arguing that internationals are taking the jobs of locals, and the more people flooding into the US, the worse the US economy becomes. However, why do not they just look at China and India, which have the largest population in the world while develop so fast over the last few years.

Imagine you are going to make a cake, and you have all the versatile friends who can help you make the cake bigger and better. Will you shut them out of the door and enjoy your little entire cake? Or will you invite them to help you make the cake and everyone could enjoy a large piece of cake because now the cake is made so large?

Obvious answer.
