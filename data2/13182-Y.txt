Obviously, I support the opt 24 months extension.

It will be a huge lost for technology and economy for USA if it failed. USA spent a lot of money to train so many international students with advanced technology. If the extension failed, these students will be very hard to find a job and will be back to their country. America will lost such huge fortune, while the other countries will benefit for it.

So I support for the extension since it really benefits for USA.
