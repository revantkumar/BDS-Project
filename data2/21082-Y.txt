As a STEM student working under OPT, I would like to have such a chance that we can extend the period. As everyone knows, 29 months is not long enough to ensure those guys who are capable to make incredible contribution or any other amazing stuff to USA. What we need is just a chance, a chance to maximize our creativity.
Someone will say 'never take those occupations from local workers'. Yes, every country has their own rights to protect their own citizens. However, I believe USA is a country with more chance for everyone. For any employer, if they got the opportunity to hire some guys to create much more efficiency and products, I don't think nationality should be the most important factor that they need to take into account.
In conclusion, as a new generation who are now living in this country, I wish we all can share the equality to work here as well.
