I'm sure the government thinks that the average citizen is too stupid to understand that allowing foreigners to stay here and work is undermining the American worker. Most of us know what Disney is doing and did. They are not the first and they will not be the last. It is terrible that the government is now wanting to extend STEM students stay in this country through the Optional Practical Training program. The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
