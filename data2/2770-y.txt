Catherine Tong I strongly support the expansion of OPT STEM extension program. Firstly, international STEM employees are not taking away jobs from US workers, but instead they stayed to meet the large demand from US employers in tech and science fields, and also bring diversify to the workforce. Secondly, students on STEM extension are well educated in US, and contributed greatly to their employers and industries through their hard work and innovation. Many of them contributed greatly to the recent developments of major tech firms, and the expansion of STEM program will allow this to be a continued success in tech industries. Lastly, OPT and STEM extension program is a very important consideration for most international college applicants when deciding where to pursue their higher education. Students contribute to the economy while they live, study and work here. Without international students paying expensive tuition, many colleges will suffer more financial difficulties and this will post a major challenge to the education system here overall.
Thus, I urge DHS to implement new rule in time to avoid a disruption in the technology industry and on students who are currently on STEM extension, as well as on US higher education institutions.
