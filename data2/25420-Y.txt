I believe OPT is one of the greatest policy that made in U.S history. The process of OPT selects the people with high education and qualify a person has outstanding skill to stay and build this country legally. A hundred years ago, millions of young people bring their enthusiasm and American dream to come to this new country and involved the greatest industrial revolution of the world. Today, I am seeing the same thing happen again. Under OPT policy, tons of young people holding their American dream and working blooding hard in Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and every single part of this country. It is telling us the next greatest industrial revolution is going to start in this land. However, the weakness of OPT program is the less time of 12 months which provide a limited time period for people to achieve their American dream. Those brilliant people have to give up their American dream and go back to their country with their incomplete project. I also believe China, which is the country sending over 300,000 students study aboard in U.S every year, is seeing this weakness as well. The limited time of OPT sets Chinese government mind at rest, and the government continue to encourage more and more brilliant students to study aboard in U.S and come back to China with outstanding skill which is helping the country maintain average 7.2% GDP increasing. 
Time is money, time is opportunity. The expanding 24 months of OPT is not only two more years of time to work in U.S, but also the two more years of opportunity to lead the world to next greatest industrial revolution, the two enthusiastically blooming years of young people to achieve their American dream.
