I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1.Talented student who come to US to study deserve more time to practice their skills after graduation. And they deserve the eaqual chance to get the practice.

2.These talented students can work for US company, and help to improve the US economy.

3.Extend OPT can attracts more student and talented people come to US and work for US.
