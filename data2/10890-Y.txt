I personally hold the view that the extension of OPT would have a far more positive impact on the state's economy and future. Technology is the key feature for a country's prosperity, with past 200 year's history proving this point. Giving more working time for those foreign students, they could and would use their knowledge and talent to keep the state remaining as the strongest and most promising country in the world. To be honest, it's true that a little job opportunities would be taken by these foreigners, but definitely they would create a lot more than what we lost now. USA is a country built on immigrants and foreigners, let's stick to our tradition and build our own mother land.
