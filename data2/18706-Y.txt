American economy needs foreign STEM engineers! I fully support this rule.

Some claim the need for foreign-born engineers reflects an unwillingness among American students to specialize in the field. In fact, rates of U.S.-born engineers remain stable. Growing demand and increased job opportunities account for the need for international workers. 

So if you shorten the OPT length, US economy will suffer from the negative effect regarding this. So does each American worker. So be aware USA folks, international students are not coming to take the jobs from you, but helping you.

Let's make a better USA together
