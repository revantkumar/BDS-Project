Lily Jiang I STRONGLY support the extension for the following reasons:

1. International students are not replacing jobs; they are filling in the void. I can affirm that my salary, as an international student, is exactly the same as the starting salary of any college new grad at the tech company I work at. I am also involved with recruiting, and I first-handedly witness how hard it is to find qualified candidates with strong quantitative skills. The company works hard to reach the hiring goal. Our current data science team has 33% foreign employees. If we had excluded these people, it would have been impossible to meet our hiring goal without significantly lowering the hiring bar. The international STEM population make significant contribution to the tech industry, quantitative finance sector, etc., which in turn are some of the biggest pillars of the U.S. economy. 

2. Net loss in financial and educational resource: I pursued my undergraduate degree at Harvard University with close to full financial aid. From the U.S. perspective, unless it is done from a purely altruistic reason, it makes little sense to eventually send back the pool of talented people they manage to attract after generously investing in all the financial and educational resource. 

3. People like us are well-educated and lawful residents in the country. We make positive impact on our local communities.
