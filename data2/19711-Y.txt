Something is seriously wrong inside the heads of people who think that taking jobs away from American citizens is the thing to do. 

The entire government of this country was created of, for and on the behalf of the citizens of this country.

Don't you people know who you were hired to represent? One thing is for sure and that is you were not hired to represent non-citizens.

You definitely have committed a breach of the American contract between the people and the government and need to lose your job PRONTO! (That means NOW! for those of you who don't know what pronto means.)
