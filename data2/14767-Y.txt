Right now, majority of the jobs on the market will reject me right away when they see that I will require sponsorship in the future; it makes sense, that process is costly and uncertain. The only jobs that would consider me are ones that are willing to trust in my potential and try me out during OPT period. Without the OPT, I highly doubt any international talent will stand a chance in staying here after graduation.
American schools attract the best and brightest around the world to come for education (although along the way we also picked up a few other things such as college football, barbecue, and etc.). Isn't it a waste of its education resources when you push the people out after years of training them instead of letting them contribute to this country afterwards?
