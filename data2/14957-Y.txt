This rule will definitely benefit the US higher education system. As I know, many of the students from other countries will consider the real industry field training part when they are making the decision for higher education. If they could get some industry field experience, they could get a job in their own country easier. Based on this consideration, only 5 of them went to UK to pursue they Master's degree. On the other hand, about 40 come to US. Partial reason is difference of the OPT rules. If the OPT extension is revoked, a lot of students will choose other countries like Canada, Australia.

In this aspect, the US higher education system will not as prosper as today, if the there is no OPT extension. Meanwhile, the high tech companies need lots of people who have advance skills with technology. This loss of talented student will also affect those companies that bring a lot of wealth to the US people.

So, I support the OPT extension which is a considerate and necessary rule for the benefits of US higher education system and the people of US.
