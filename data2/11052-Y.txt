Definitely, F1 students make great contributions not only to US colleges but also to US employers and industry. They bring different thoughts and ideas to this great country and diversity is a key factor to make US as the strongest country in the world. All students who need OPT must be, firstly, great students because they are graduated from excellent US colleges and secondly, great employees because they get jobs from extraordinary US companies. They are treasure for US so I think this rule would attract more great students all over the world. And then US would be a better country. I agree with this rule.
