I DO support the OPT Extension plan. International students bring lots of economy benefits. They need to pay for their tuitions,lease houses, shop for food , travel around US for entertainment. These activities all contribute to US economy growth. Once the OPT extension is not passed, US will be less attractive to those students and them may go to other countries like UK ,Germany or France. If that really happens ,various industries will suffer great loss and the universities would also suffer from money shortage. So for the good of America economy and the students, we should pass the policy.
