I strongly support this OPT extension for STEM F1 students. International STEM students work very hard to get into top US universities, especially graduate schools, and again work very hard to get their degrees. They have the right skills and talents in this tech-driven era to help boost US economy and stay as the most innovative country in the world. According to the Partnership for a New American Economy, in 2011, foreign-born inventors were credited with contributing to more than 75 percent of patents issued to the top 10 patent-producing universities.
