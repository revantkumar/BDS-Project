Definitely thumb up for the proposal! Some people are blaming their low salary and failure in job hunting on international students. The better way to survive is to improve yourself and be more competitive! Given same quality of candidates, companies will choose U.S students over international students because they don't need to provide sponsorship to them. So make yourself better before complaining!
