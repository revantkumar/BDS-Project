I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. If cancel the Opt extention, the attraction of US education will decreased to international student. This will eventually affect US economy. Think about the huge amount of tuition that the international students paid to US.
2. Some people argue that international students will take jobs from the natives if extend the OPT. That's not true. It is quite hard to live in a different country, not all international student want to stay in this country, they just want to get some working experience in a more international enviroment. The globalization process make all countries in the world need more and more talents that can work in international enviroment. Most international student just want to become this kind of talent in their own country-that can gain them a better life.
3.Even if some of them choose to stay in US after graduation, international students who have obtained STEM degree are those who can contribute to the US society. With the knowledge and skills they learned here, they can contribute to the advancement of US science and technology
