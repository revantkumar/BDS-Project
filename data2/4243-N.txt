Thank You for letting us voting taxpayers give our comments. I am against the proposed rule and it is time that we are heard on our views as an American Citizen. Many of our college students are funding their own college education and this would cut back of summer jobs available to them, not only summer jobs, but weekends and after school jobs while still in college. If foreigners want to come to United States for College they should have their own funding, not come here to think they can take over the available summer or after school jobs. There should be a quota of how many are allowed from each country, but 120,000 students is just too many. Foreigners have special wants and needs and we cater to them. It is time to turn the attention to our American students and let the Foreign countries take care of their own. It is also time for our Congressmen to listen to us American Citizens, we are not happy with all the changes that have been and still tying to change written rules and laws to suit foreigners and immigrants.
