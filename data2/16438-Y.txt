I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Not having the STEM policies will impose a negative effect directly on American education system. International students pay four times more tuition than American students, and most of the tuition fees are contributed to school facilities and better education resources. If the policies will not be approved, less international students will choose to go to America to study. Rather, they would choose to go to other countries that provide them with better opportunities. How can you make sure the U.S. will be the nation with the BEST education in the future without all of the financial support and resources support from the international student? Let me restate my position. I SUPPORT the proposal, and you should think about the consequences of not having enough international students in American schools.
