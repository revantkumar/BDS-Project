I am beginning to be concerned that our federal government is running the opposite of what it means to be an American. A foreign student attending college here is NOT an American. Someone who entered our country illegally is NOT an American A foreign worker is not an American and should NOT be given a job when thousands of our American college students are unable to find jobs. 

There are so many heads of families without jobs and our government gives jobs to foreign workers who in all likelyhood will NOT pay taxes here, support social security and probably have no health insurance but will use our ER facilities when
needing medical attention. 

While visiting other countries, I found it is difficult for an American to get a job there and if medical services are required, one must pay up front. America cannot be the source of jobs just because foreign students come to college here. As a retired
educator, I bemoan the loss of jobs for our own students, those unemployed for lack of jobs because a foreign person has it.
If foreign students come here to college,our education must be better than they could obtain in their home country. Certainly then our own students in these same colleges deserve to have these jobs under fair conditions for they are citizens.
