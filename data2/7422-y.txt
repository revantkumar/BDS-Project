Else Lin I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule. Technology companies in America have strong desires for tech talents. If the OPT can be extended, those American IT companies can survive and thrive in the future by not only recruiting domestic talents, but attracting foreign smart guys. However, if the new OPT rule cannot be realized, those smart international students, students who come to American and strengthen their skills with help of the American education system, will go back to their homeland and make the competitors of American IT companies much stronger. Why not keep those international talents in America for a longer time to contribute to America's IT industry and the whole economy?
