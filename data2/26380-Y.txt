This is a welcome move by Homeland Security Department.
This will give a fair chance to F1-students to hone their skills by working for top tech firms in US. This would be a boost for startup culture also as many students after working for few years would like to work on their own ideas. Overall a win and win situation for all - US economy, US Univs/schools, students and society as a whole.
