There is no reason to refuse American citizens job opportunities in order to bring in aliens whether short or 
long time 'visit'. Millions of skilled workers are out of jobs because of Open Border policies, American citizens cannot
afford the college tuition to be doctors or engineers when they have the qualifications to enter the American colleges.
Many who take this opportunity are not keeping their skills in America, they are running back home with their free
degrees.
