I totally support the proposed new rule on OPT STEM Extension. Some objection says that it is against the purpose of F1 visa because it should not include such a long OPT period that allows students to work, but I think the new rule and the OPT itself actually meets the purpose of F1 visa. The F1 visa gives international student legal period of time to learn new knowledge in the US, and I think the learning process should not only include the academic study, but also include the process that applies the academic knowledge and skills into practical real-world projects. And OPT provides great opportunity for them to go to those high-tech companies and build up knowledge map in their specific field of study. Also, compared to other types of jobs, STEM usually requires more time to learn project-based methodologies and tools, and the life cycle of the projects and tasks is usually longer, so extending STEM could help those students to contribute themselves better and create more value to the company they are working at.
