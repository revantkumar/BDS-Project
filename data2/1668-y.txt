Luis Brown I strongly support STEM OPT policy

Therere a plethora of new STEM-related jobs posted every single day and it really depends on whether youre qualified to get hired. No company, especially those STEM big names, will ever hire an employee simply because they can provide low salaries because the salary level is actually pretty transparent nowadays, thanks to Glassdoor.com and all other professional forums. Tons of 6-digit silicon valley jobs are waiting to be filled but ONLY by qualified candidates that can get jobs done.
