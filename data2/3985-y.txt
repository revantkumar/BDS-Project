Abdullah Sayed I strongly support 24 months STEM extension proposal submitted by DHS, a part of overall development in USA. 

1. Can we think about USA without any international professional contribution for positive economic growth? The answer should be straight 'Negative'. The contribution of internationals in USA is significant enough them to get enough privilege to provide them enough opportunity like 24 month extension.

2. The brightest students from all over the world are coming to USA to have higher degree and state of the earth research in accredited educational institution. And this opportunity is not also free of cost. They need to pay tuition and living expense to stay and study in USA. If STEM extension is eliminated, there would be significant drop of students to come to USA for higher study, and therefore USA will lose the opportunity to have valuable talents from all over the world.

3. Now a days, H1B visa is provided in terms of lottery. And for providing more opportunity to get change to participate this lottery, STEM extension for 24 months would be a great move.

Lastly, as the contribution of internationals are very significant for overall development of USA, DHS should come up with this kind of extension opportunity for international students. Thus, USA can get the highest benefit from international students.
