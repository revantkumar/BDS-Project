I strongly support this proposal. My schoolmates are from different countries and they are so talented which provides us local students positive pressure to improve. I think our country is an immigration country and it has a long immigration history, which means it should open the door for the whole world to allow anyone with intelligence to make contribution to our country. OPT extension is a good way to encourage more students with smart thoughts and sharp skills to help our country to advanced. Just do it!!!
