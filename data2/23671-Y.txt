I strongly SUPPORT this rule to extend OPT extension to 24 months, it will be even better if it could be extend longer. It is not only a good thing for international students, but also important for American high-tech companies. As far as I am concerned, it should takes at least 3 years to let international students give back what they have learned in the US collage to American companies.

For a STEM student graduated from the collage, it usually takes 3 to 6 months to find a job. And after he finds a job, it takes about 3 months to be familiar with the work environment and the companies' technology. After that, he can begin to perform his skill to the companies, for example, for a math student, he could begin to build models or research tools, it should takes about 1 year to establish the tool as a product for his companies; after that, it usually takes a year to improve and maintain this product and the it can be used to make money. Last, if he cannot get his work visa at the end of the third year, it should take a few month to document his work and train another worker to take over it. 

Therefore, the time line is about: 3 to 6+3+12+12+3=36 to 39 months, 12 OPT and 24 months extension perfect fit this. Let's get international students' skills for US companies first before sending them home! If we just give the 12 months OPT, the foreign companies' will get them right at the time when they can begin to give back what they have!
