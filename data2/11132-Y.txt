I strongly support the proposal for the following two main reasons:

1. With a longer term of training opportunities, international students can have more time to utilize what they learn here to contribute to US industry and academy. 

2. Even though the diversity could somehow brings competition into job opportunity, we all know that competition drives progress in society. With competition, people have desire to improve their own skills and knowledge, which can develop technology with great value.
