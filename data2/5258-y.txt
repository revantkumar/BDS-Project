Barry Courson I support new OPT extension. The reason why US becomes the most developed country in the world is that US is always attracting most brilliant people on earth, and diversity in this country makes it still reviving after hundreds of years. Only by continuing allowing talented people work in US can make this keep to be the most developed one in the world.
