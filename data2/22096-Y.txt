Maybe a better way is to have different policies for international students with different degrees?

We surely want to keep those PhD level ones, since the US schools and the country need to spend a lot of money and time to train them. It will be a huge loss if they go back to their own country directly. We surely don't want to use our money to help other countries to train talented people.
