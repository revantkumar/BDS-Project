I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. International students are assets rather than liabilities to U.S.. Since U.S. is the cluster of the most brilliant minds, attracting talents are of significant value to the development of advanced technology and economy. Comparing to the emerging economies, the core competitiveness of US companies in the global context are the intellectual products which requires sustainable supply of talented international students.

2. Diversity is one of the core value for the U.S. spirit. Keeping students from different background will stimulate the global cultural communication as well as develop the global vision of U.S. students. Moreover, these cultural communication and interaction of interest will brings opportunities of developing global entrepreneurship. For example, there are many international students participating in the startup companies initiated by American students in the Sillicon Valley. And they grant potential for these startups to grow into global businesses.

3. Many students wish to gain working experiences before they left U.S. for contributing their mother countries. The U.S. working experiences will be a competitive remark on their resume. And they are not neccessarily competing with the local citizens since they are not targeting at perminant jobs. The emerging market in Asia has granted rewarding positions for students with US education and working experiences. Therefore the U.S. Government do not necessarily have to worry too much about the loss of local job oppotunities. Also efficient international students can contribute to higher profit of local firms which will enable more job opportunities for local residents.
