I strongly support this proposal! The voice saying that expanding OPT will occupy US citizen's job opportunity is ridiculous. I am in charge of recruiting for a high-tech start up. It is well known that it's getting harder to hire matching candidates these years. Stopping expanding the OPT for international students especially for those STEM students will bring nothing to us but make it even worse for the company like us.
