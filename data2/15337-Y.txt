I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. First, this OPT extension rule helps attract more global talents to US, who will make great contributions to this great country. Meanwhile, this will largely increase the diversity in the community.Second, this new rule will definitely lead to a more open environment in US. And 
I believe that this is always one of the drivers for a great society. As globalization is inevitably growing, the best way to keep competitive is embracing all the talents in the international market. Without any doubt, this new rule is a great tool from the perspective of a country. Third, as one of the major stakeholders, any employer in US who is hiring employees under OPT policy now will definitely face a big loss if this new rule fails to pass. Overall, I agree that this new rule should pass considering so many benefits to US.
