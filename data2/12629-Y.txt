Throughout the history of America, immigrants have made great contributions to the economy and society, as well as science and technology. In my opinion, one important reason that US is so strong now is that it is friendly to all the talented people regardless of the race. For many foreign students, if they don't have a chance to contribute to the society after years of hard work at school due to the immigration policy, it will be not only a pity for themselves, but more for the country. Thus, I strongly support the extension of OPT. Thanks!
