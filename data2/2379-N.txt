We have 92 million Americans unemployed or underemployed and we don't need to bring in more. I am hearing we have 35 to 40 % of the new immigrants are on entitlement programs housing,food stamps, medicaid, college tuition. We have enough trouble taking care of our own without bringing in more to take care of.
