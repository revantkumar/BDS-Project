Ty Cao I strongly support this new policy. 

In my opinion, a lot of objection comments are just short-sighted and un-supported by the truth. 

A lot of people claim that most international students are just cheap labors for big companies. Which I believe it simply not true at all. Most internatioanl students are highly educated and highly trained in their corresponding areas. On average, they earn good salaries and they contribute much more to this country than they make. Talents all around the world make United States the strongest country in the world. It might be true that in a short period, if you stop hiring international students, U.S citizens could get more job oppotunites. However, in a long term it would definitely a big harm to this country. In a matter of fact, without these foreign talents, a lot of great company in this country would not exist from the beginning. 

International workers pay as much taxes, medicare, ssn etc as U.S. citizen do (if not more!). They pay those even if they don't use those benefits eventually. 

The foundation of this country is immigrants. It is this kind of open mind makes this great country in the past 200 years. I believe this new policy would be another milestone to make this great country even better.
