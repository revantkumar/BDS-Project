I think OPT extension should be pretty good. International students from all over the world, who are well-educated, will contribute to this country. They can propose some new ideas and also turn their knowledge into job opportunities. Besides, these students work in the US, live in the US. They pay tax with pretty low crime rate. Why don't make them stay here longer?
