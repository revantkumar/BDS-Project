Every year students from across the world take loans to pay the heavy international fee to study and find opportunities on fair grounds. We share rooms, share food, looking for part time at the school dining and parking and labs to pay for living, parallely studying , applying for jobs, and holding our hopes for us and our families. We do this for the education and exposure and in return work hard and try to be efficient members of the workforce , learning skills on the go, as and when the market demands it. Employers hire us through the same hiring process everyone goes through. Same interviews, same questions. Except we have a loan we might be paying off for the rest of our lives, if we do not get the chance to be employed fairly. We do not have a house or a basic car, sometimes we do not even have friends to put aside the differences in culture and ask how the day has been. Sometime we communicate differently. Sometimes we don't get the reference in a movie or a joke, and sometimes we have a joke no one around will understand. Financially and emotionally, we have a hard time and All we come here for is the chance to be part of the job force to be closer to the skillsets we readily have and can put to use. We believe we only make the diversity richer. We learn and give equally. OPT is the most essential part to this equation in education.
