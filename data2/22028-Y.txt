I think this is great. It gives more opportunities to both U.S. and foreign workers. It is apparently a mutual benefit. This is why U.S. is a great country and everybody want to be living here. 
My point is that rejecting this petition can potentially harm U.S. technology industry and even homeland security. Most foreign students with an advanced degree in STEM will go back to their mother country like China without OPT extension. As we know, the cyber security in U.S. is facing a huge challenge here and the master minds trained in the University will actually handle all the technical problems that finally deliver security to the U.S. You can image when these trained students went back home, they can be potentially leveraged by their government. They will possibly never come back to work in U.S. at their own will. And this is a one-way street, only few U.S. citizens are trained oversea which means U.S. have nothing to leverage! This is an opportunity for U.S. to migrate foreign technology elites for free. They are trained in their home country for all their fundamental educations sponsored by their country and personally pay U.S. huge amount of money for their study in U.S. in order to be employed by U.S. company which helps grow U.S. economy and build cyber security infrastructures.
