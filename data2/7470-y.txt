Kongzi Wukong I strongly support the new extension rule, the reasons are as follows:

1. the foundation and raise of this nation is people, talented people in all fields. New OPT extension rules provide much better opportunities for people in technical and scientific fields to stay in US and therefore make contributions to the nation.

2. the proud of the nation is equality and freedom. all people that qualified in work are deserved to have equal opportunities to get a job. the job market is free and competitive, please do not let the OPT rule to block the way to pursue rights for all international students.
