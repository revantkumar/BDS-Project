michalle yang I strongly SUPPORT the new rule! For job opportunities, I have to say that U.S. companies will recruit native students first because native students have better communication skills unless the American student way weaker than his/her international competitor. If you cannot win over an foreigner, be aware! It is time for you to make yourself stronger in your major.
