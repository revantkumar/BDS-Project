Paula Ford Do NOT expand Optional Practical Training. In fact, you should end it.

I strongly oppose giving advantages to foreign students over American students competing for STEM jobs. It is a lie that there are not enough American STEM graduates for existing jobs. The competition for STEM jobs is intense. Many talented, smart American students are unable to find STEM jobs after graduating because of these ridiculous government programs. My son is an Electrical Engineering student about to graduate with honors, and I think it is appalling that companies are given incentives ( read tens of thousands of DOLLARS! ) to hire these foreigners over my American-white-male son. My son and I are TAXPAYERS! These foreigners, who pay no taxes, are given unfair advantage. This has to STOP!

On top of that, foreign students are GIVEN special mentoring (paid for by my tax dollars) that my son, as an AMERICAN, will not receive. 

Then there's the fact that these F1 aliens get into the USA and then fail to leave when their time is up. More illegal aliens taking advantage of our country's generosity. Lawlessness should not be rewarded.

Do NOT expand OPT. End it. 

Americans for American jobs!
