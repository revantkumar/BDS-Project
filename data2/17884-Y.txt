I really understand the hardness of international students they put in U.S. and the willingness they really want to stay in U.S. 
This could benefit for both of international students and the U.S. education system. 
The extension of OPT is a great opportunity that attract more and more intelligent and talent potentials from ALL OVER the world. In a long term, when they get high level and quality of education in U.S., it could benefit the world eventually. I am definitely supporting this extension.
