Don't blame the immigration policy if you can not find a job. It is your qualification, instead of your immigration status!

I have an American labmate. We graduated at the same time and were looking for entirely different jobs (no competition between us at all). Eventually I was able to find a job, he was not. Why? Because he is not good enough. He was not working hard at all and were unwilling to make contributions to our research group. As a result, he doesn't have much to put on his resume and the advisor doesn't write him a good letter. So, he couldn't find a job even though he already has more resources by being an American.
