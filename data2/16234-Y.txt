I support the extension. One thing discussed a lot is that whether this extension would affect the hiring of citizenship, which the answer is NO. Hiring the international students does not need to mean that the companies do not hire Americans, as both are paid same and the companies need to pay more because it needs additional costs to hire non-citizens. So extension to OPT does not affect the hiring of Americans at all.
