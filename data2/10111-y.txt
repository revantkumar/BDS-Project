Jane Janette As a United State Citizen, I support OPT extension from happening. 

Im a HR of a mid-sized company. 

Our company currently has around 10 International students that under F1 OPT status. 

I can say that those people are talented, good at their work and very professional. 

It is a very big lost for all the companies that keep these talented people just because of they lost the opportunity to use OPT Extension. 

I feel ridiculous that lots of citizens saying that those people took their job opportunities. Are you just trying to say they are better so they took your job? Actually these people has different culture background and talent can help us to have a better U.S. This is also the reason why we are getting stronger from the first place. 

Again I support this rule from happening and shame on those losers who afraid of competition.
