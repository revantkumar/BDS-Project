I support the new 24-month OPT extension. The original motivation of OPT extension for STEM international students is that the US does not have enough students studying science/engineering, and there are more and more US companies heavily relying on science and technology. Thus the extension, totally for the benefit of the US economy.

The latest unemployment rate of 5% is at a historical low. I don't see how the American jobs are stolen by those foreigners with special skills. Please do the right thing for the economy, not for some groups of political purposes.
