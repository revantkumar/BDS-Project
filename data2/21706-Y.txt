As a F-1 stem student, the practice after graduation is important for both international students and the United States.
There are several reasons for extension of the stem. First of all, the students with high technology skills could make more contributions to the United States. Secondly, the longer extension period of OPT could reliefs the pressure of the H1B application. Thirdly, many international students have advantages in multi-cultural background, which could benefit the U.S. global development.
