Seriously I have no idea what is going on with this country. To uneducated illegal immigrants who work at restaurants & bars for tips, you guys said YES. To people who claim themselves as being "prosecuted" by their own government, but which in fact highly likely they are not, you guys said YES. To those babies who were simply born here regardless of their family backgrounds, you guys said YES.

And now to some newly graduated international college students, you guys are like: take your talents and go home. I'm sorry but I cannot possibly understand the logic in it.
