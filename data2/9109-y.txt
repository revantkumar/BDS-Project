Lucas Yu In my opinion, to prolong the OPT will help improve the domestic consumption, let the GDP get higher.According to the NAFSA, there were $26.8 billion that international cost in US in 2013-2014.Also I think that prolong the OPT will not let Amercian citizens and residents' caeer chance lower than before. Because of America need many people work for STEM career, prolong OPT can relieve the labor shortage.There are not many local Amercians student STEM major, so international students will not damage them. According to American history, there were many talents from this world everywhere make the US today, prolong the OPT can help US have more talents work for their company.
