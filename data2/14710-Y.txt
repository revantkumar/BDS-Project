I strongly support this proposal for these two reasons.
1. Help company to save the cost. Company spends a lot of money and time to train a new employee, STEM OPT extension definitely maximizes the effort they put into training an international employee.
2. Help university to admit more talented people. STEM OPT extension helps the university and college in U.S. to attract more talented students from other countries. It can help the university in U.S. to keep a strong competitiveness in the world.
