Anonymous I believe the OPT extension is a necessary step to ensure the country continues to improve on retaining international talent with STEM degrees. With the current significant lack of H1-B visa application slots relative to the demand, OPT becomes one of the few ways in which promising international students can continue to stay in the US in the hopes of re-applying and acquiring said visa. Without the extension, a vast number of current employees from overseas across many US companies will be forced to leave the country. These companies, and by association the country, will be losing a significant workforce consisting of highly educated and valuable individuals.

Attracting international talent is a proven way for a country to boost innovation and the economy, and it would be only to the detriment of the US to change its immigration policy to work against this fact. Furthermore, it seems nonsensical to me to invest the time and resources of top professors and colleges around the nation to educate international students, only to force them out of the country instead of allowing them to contribute back to the society.

Thus, I am completely in favor of the proposed changes to the OPT program
