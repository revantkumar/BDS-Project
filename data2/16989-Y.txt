Strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. STEM students learn so many valuable skills from US universities. Their contributions to the US industry will empower the development of American technology. 

2. Competitions don't exist between us citizens and STEM students, many IT positions are short of people because citizens don't have related skills. STEM student with valuable skill can fit the position and raise the global impact of American Technic companies.

3. The economic case for legal immigration is overwhelming. International STEM students fill the gap in the labor force. They contribute to taxes, social security. They are far more likely to start their own companies and employ American workers.
