I strongly support the proposal of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degree because the proposal will bring the US lots of benefits.

US's economy relies largely on high-tech companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon etc. Those companies gain their edge from people with skills in math, computer science, engineer and technology. Many of the basic technical work are just done by STEM students (young tech professionals) working with their OPTs. If OPT extension cancelled, the cost for completing those basic yet demanding work would be driven much higher and thus it would lower the competitiveness of those companies and in turn affect US economy negatively. 

So I strongly support the proposal of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students!
