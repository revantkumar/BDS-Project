I support this proposed rule of "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students" by Homeland Security Department. 
This rule will benefit both the employers in the united states as well as nonimmigrant students.
