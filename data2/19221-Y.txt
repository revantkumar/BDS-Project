Obviously, this rule can help America develop faster in the field of technology. America is a country with muti-culture and freedom. Foreign students who study in the universities in America can practice their skills by working in the country and will contribute to the growth of American economy. 
In fact, most of the engineering students are from foreign countries and are interested in working in US. And luckily, more and more talented students want to study abroad in America. However, only if some of them know that they will have the chance to stay in America for more than a year to learn and practice after they graduate, can they take the big step to go to America for further education.
In addition, if the rule cannot pass in the end, these students will study in their own countries or think about finding some universities in other countries. As a result, America will lose these excellent students and workers; other countries can benefit a lot from letting these students work for them.
