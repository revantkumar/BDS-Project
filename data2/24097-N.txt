I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training period to 3
years. It is difficult for American workers t find jobs. They should be given the first chance at any available work. Also 
Americans pay taxes, which non-residents do not. It is not in America's best interest to do this and we should put 
American interests first.
