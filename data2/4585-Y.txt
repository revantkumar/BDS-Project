I support this extension.

Most high-tech companies in U.S. need international students. These diverse talents from all around the world greatly boost U.S. economy. With these talent people, native americans will have enough feelings of competition and then strive to study and work harder. In the long run, U.S will definitely benefit from these international students. As the largest economy entity in the whole world, U.S should absorb more and more talents, especially in STEM field where most americans don't bother to work in. 

Also, most international students do not want to leave in america for live. They just want to gain valuable experience from the OPT in the most developed country and go back to contribute to their own country. As a responsible country, U.S. should not only care about itself, but also lead the whole world to develop rapidly. This is why United States of America is the strongest country in the world. Our successful education system cannot run well without these talent international students who want to benefit from the attractive OPT and OPT extension.

In conclusion, OPT extension will not only benefit international students, but also benefit United States of America itself.
