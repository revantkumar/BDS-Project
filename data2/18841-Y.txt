I strongly support this. 

I'm a Chinese high school student that are considering studying in the US for my collage and maybe higher degrees. 

I think this act will actually grant me enough time to stay in the US(if i majored in STEM) to strength what I learned from school and gain industrial experience. I think if this act passes, US will be on the top of the countries that I am interested in. This act actually shows US really cares about the international students, not just making money, like some other countries.

Therefore this act will improve the US's reputation of the quality of education. I really hope this can pass.
