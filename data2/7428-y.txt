BO LIU I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1 The jobs international students take are the job posts where there is great insufficiency of US citizens. If stopping hiring international students, these job posts will NOT be filled by US citizens but left un-filled since no US citizen can be hired (due to insufficient amount). Thus there is no issue that international students competes with US citizens on job opportunities.

2 The US universities spent a lot of money and resource in teaching international students on higher education, OPT might be the most useful way to let these students pay back the US society with the knowledge and the skill the US universities have taught them.

3 Many US citizens are eager to make start-ups and start their own business. What they concerns is they are not able to hire enough people to work in their startups and enterprises. International students with OPT are great resource to help their startup hire enough people and help their business grow. It would be great loss that if the next Google, Facebook go abort due to lack of human resource, which could have been helped by students with OPT.
