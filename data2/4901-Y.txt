I strongly support the new rule of OPT.

Firstly, it is the foreign talents that keeps US in the leading position of high tech industry around the world. Forcing the talented student leave US after they have the high quality education in US is a disaster for the high tech companies. And the situation becomes worse after they come back to their home country and serve for the local companies. They will compete against the US companies and eventually make US lose the leading position.

Secondly, hiring foreign students won't hurt the job opportunities for the the US citizens. The high tech company is still growing rapidly and needs lots of outstanding engineers. Its cost much more for the company to hire a foreign student than a local citizen, but they still hires lots of the students is simply because, one, the rapid growth need more and more engineers, and two, some of the local citizens are not qualified for such position which force the company to look for foreign students. 

Finally, one of the reason that US is in the leading position of all kinds of area is because US has the best universities and research centers in the world and it attracts the best talents around the world to make further progress. If the time of STEM OPT becomes shorter, the universities in US will becomes less attractive for the foreign students and they may seek education opportunities in other countries like UK and Canada. If it happens, it will be really painful for the universities in US because of less income and more challenges to keep the leading position.
