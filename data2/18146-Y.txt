I strongly SUPPORT this OPT proposal and here are my arguments. Before that, a little bit about myself, I am a US citizen and I have been in high-tech industry for over ten years.

To those saying why not give jobs to US born Americans.
Globalization is irreversible trend and we Americans need to know that American does not come with the mighty economy. We spent generations of hard working and finally become the center of the world after WWII. Always keep in mind that we are an immigration country and that's what keeps us powerful. It's not about giving jobs to US born Americans, it's about what is your competitiveness. If you take a look at the current job market, there are lots of restrictions and barriers for a foreigner who is not citizen or permanent resident to get a job, that's how our country protect you. In the meantime, the companies are always seeking for maximizing their profits. Why they foreigners doing better than you? Ask yourself and find a reason instead of stopping just complaining about it everywhere.
