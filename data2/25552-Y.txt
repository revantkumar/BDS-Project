I strongly support the OPT Extension proposal.These are the reasons:
1. It's not about whether Americans are smarter and more creative than students from other country. All men are born equal and should be given the same opportunity. Talent is talent, it's not about nationality. That is what keeps America, an immigration country can become the most powerful country in the world. Look at what result the Seclusion policy do to China, a once powerful empire before WWI.

2. All Americans are descendants of immigrants. The reason we are where we are is because our great grand parents have the right to pursue a better life. Don't shut the door to someone in their shoes.

3. To hire an international student, a company has to provide sponsor for their visa and cannot have a salary lower than average industry salary. Who says they are the reason some American STEM students don't get a job. Good American STEM students still get job and those who are laid off and eliminated from the business blame international students for their failure.
