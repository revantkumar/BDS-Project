Jingchi Liu I definitely support STEM OPT extension. International Students into STEM disciplines, come to U.S to get into the Research and Development activities here. US has been the epicenter of many new technologies in the past and also in future. This diverse atmosphere helps nurture a strong workforce.

Also, the students learn a lot which help them broaden their horizon. The Post-graduation OPT period curtails this freedom. Extending it will provide relief to a lot of students who can have a longer time to undergo training.
