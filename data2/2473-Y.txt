1. I want to say all those americans that hate and sacred of foreigners might take their jobs. Do you forget that the very foundation of this nation, freedom? How can you have the right to work while others can't? This is just another form of racialism.

2. What makes the USA stand on the top of world, become the greatest country in world? People, people with talent and determine to hard work. If you look in the past history, America always benefit from the new blood fill in the county. Since when America turns to reject those people who are more than qualified to join this great nation and have the ability and the determine to contribute this great nation. 

3. This is a free market, if you can't compete with other job candidates , it's your own fault for not being qualified, not the hard working foreigners fault.

4. Other nations are rising now, the threat is real, China, Russia, etc. If Uncle Sam want to give up a war on fighting to keep talents people and lose the future, and lose everything this great country has achieved, then do as those immigrants hater says. 

5. High tech industry is mainstay of this country, and without "cheap" and "complainingless" international students from STEM majors, this market and industry will never bloom. Again , think rationally Uncle Sam, if you really want to lose the only advantage that keep this country remain world super power, then do as those new racialism people say.

6. And after all, this is just a OPT extension proposal, not even an action targeting on changing immigrant laws. All the worries throw by negative comments are unfounded and subjective conjectured.

For above reasons I gave, I fully support the OPT extension proposal
