I strongly vote for Improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Students!

First of all, F-1 Students and H1B visa holder consists of a huge part of workforce in IT industry. Expanding OPT time means more OPT students and opportunities to get H1B visa. 

Lack of these employees would decrease the growth of IT industry and severely affect the economy in the U.S.

Further, less opportunities for F-1 student also means less F-1 students coming to the U.S., since most of them expect to have a couple of years work experience in the U.S. And the tuition of international students account for a large part of the University income, which would also affect education in the U.S.

Give them a chance!
