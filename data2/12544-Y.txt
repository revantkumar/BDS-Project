I strongly support to extend to 24 months. Because I am a Ph.D. candidate and my major is Computational Engineering. I like to do research here and I believe the research environment in the USA is better than in my own country. Here I can almost only focus on the research topics and do not need to worry about lots of paper works and lots of social activities, which is impossible in my own country. I have fully confidence to do a good research job to benefit my researching area meanwhile to benefit the USA society and the world which including my own country. Hence here I am and in my opinion 24 months is better than 17 months. Thank you and wish you the best.
