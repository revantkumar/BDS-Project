Robert Thompson Jobs should go to OUR PEOPLE, American CITZENS, not foreign workers. I shouldn't even have to object to such stupidity. How can anyone even consider the idea of hiring foreign workers ahead of American citizens? This goes directly against what the government is supposed to do! The government is supposed to PROTECT its' citizens and that includes protecting our access to jobs. My God, this is so ridiculous I just can't get over it.
