Do improve the H1b visa program that are all but monopolized
by Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and HCL, Deloitte and Accenture.
Foreign students pay premium dollars to get an American education,
and deserve at least a little payoff, a little American dream. The US public
will also benefit from the best and brightest international talents.

Without Opt STEM extension, and with H1b being unavailable to US educated 
international students, US higher education industry will risk a 
death spiral because foreign students and parents will wake up to 
the scam. Their kids were wanted and called the best and brightest
to pay top dollars, then the moment the kids graduate, they are not
wanted any more by the US businesses.
