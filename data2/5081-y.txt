Mengchen Tang I strongly support this ruling. I came to the US rather than a different country for study because I knew that I could have training to adjust to the real world out of school for a good amount of time. My family sold our apartment and lived with our relatives because they needed to pay for my 20+ thousand tuition (US Universities would simply not provide financial aid for equally qualified International students.) I made this decision because I was told to believe that US has the best education and was fair to International students. But after I finished school the country wanted to change the rule, after eating up all the money I paid for school, food, housing, cars, travel, etc. I certainly could not earn back my tuition in one year. I feel that I was deceived by this country that at one time I thought was the origin of the "American Dream." Thanks DHS for proposing this rule. People could not be too blind to only see the jobs but not the market we have brought here. OPT is tied with the US educational market. If no OPT extension, then no foreign students, and no cash to save the country from another financial crisis.
