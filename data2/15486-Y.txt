As an international student working in USA currently, I strongly support the proposal for following reasons:

1. Through two years experience learning in USA, I acquired lots of information and computer knowledge and technologies making me more confident and feel myself a useful person for the society. So I am willing to make contribution to USA and obviously the original time of OPT is not enough.

2. Competition is everywhere all over the world, but according to my understanding, my position software engineer is a position not liked by most native USA residents which could be proved by the fact that many software engineers in USA are foreigners especially international students. Thus, we not only captured the working opportunity of native residents, but also filled in many empty position for IT field.

3. According to previous experience, many international students made big contribution on USA during the OPT working time and lots of excellent achievements were made by international students, especially in IT fields. Besides, IT position is a position that is needed by almost all kinds of company in such a information era, I think the society needs lots of people like us who can work on this position.
