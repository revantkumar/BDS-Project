Chris G I strongly support this extension due to the following reasons:

1, It benefits the US employers
This is just a short time extension in the field of STEM, where there is a shortage of qualified workers for most US companies. This would not reduce the employment rate for domestic students because it usually cost more for a company to recruit international student. Under the condition that no qualified domestic students would the companies reach out to seek for international students. So the extension would allow companies to find qualified students.

2, It benefits society and economy
As previously said, the more roles could find suitable workers, the more contribution a company can make to the overall society and economy. In addition, the diverse and liberal culture of US would benefit from having more well-educated people with diverse background.

3, It benefits the US education
Having a two year extension would increase the academic competitiveness of US schools, especially in the filed of STEM. In addition, most school rely on the huge tuition international students paid to support the campus infrastructure and service, which would in return benefit the whole student communities. 

Due to the reasons stated above, I strongly support the extension.
