John Wang The new OPT STEM extension rule is very beneficial to the U.S., so I strongly support it. First, allowing foreign students who have learned advanced techniques to continue making contributions to their specialized fields for our country will reinforce the advantageous status of our country in terms of techniques. Superior techniques produce better products, and they will be competitive in the international market. If those who master advanced techniques serve our competitors, our strengths will one day disappear. Second, STEM fields are where creativity and innovations happen. These innovations will in turn create more opportunities for domestic workers. Who could imagine that Internet changed our country and the whole world? Because of the invention of Internet, the online business like Amazon could succeed, and consequently many suppliers cooperating with Amazon also share big growths. So the impact of innovation is profound, and foreign students who could directly help innovations happen should have more time to do that, that is exactly what the new extension rule comes into play. Third, from the perspective of microeconomics mechanism design, the new rule elicits good employers who values the training of foreign students while protecting native employees. These employers are our country's mainstays that boost the economy. They truly care about our workers. The more successful these good employers are, the better conditions our workers will have. And in this process, foreign students play a role of serving these good employers while receiving their training. It is thus desirable to let students and employers enjoy this win-win situation. Hence, I cannot agree more with the new extension rule.
