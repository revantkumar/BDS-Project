I strongly agree with this proposal. This proposal embodies the progress toward immigrant policy, and meanwhile, does not harm the benefit of U.S. workers.

If U.S. colleges and universities still want to attract top students around all over the world and remain internationally competitive, the STEM OPT Extension is very helpful, especially when this has been implemented for years. No students want to achieve only limited work experience and have to go back to their own country soon after graduation, which is not ideal for their careers. If the OPT Extension stops, I highly doubt if there still will be more and more international students coming to U.S. in the future.

On the other hand, companies need fresh blood to keep innovative and expanding. International students are no doubt a boost to the recovering economy. U.S. companies employ smart and productive students, which help them to create and expand business, while not having to pay higher salaries as more experienced workers.
