I strongly stand against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau for expanding training opportunities for F-1 Non- Immigrant Students. Too many of our young US citizens and legal immigrants are having a difficult time finding a job. They do not need to compete with Non-Immigrant students. Please do you pass this this ruling.
