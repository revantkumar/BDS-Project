Jiayi Du I strongly support this new OPT extension rule because as an engineer graduate student, practical training in STEM fields should be encouraged to pursue meaningful projects that contribute to a deeper understanding of their field of study and help develop the practical skills necessary to advance their careers. 

For global companies, they definitely need researchers or engineers to build connections and share technical ideas all over the world. The new OPT extension rule will help international students who graduate from U.S. universities gain more practical skills as well as help U.S. global companies build technical and business connections with other countries, thus improve the economies. 

And one initial year for OPT will be too short for an engineering training or engineering project. 24-month OPT extension is good enough for both international students and the flow of global companies' talented people.
