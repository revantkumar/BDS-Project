Firstly, I strongly support the extension of STEM OPT for international students studying in STEM fields.

As a research staff in a public university, I have worked with at least ten international students through my years of work. Most of them are very gifted and diligent learners and young researchers in the lab.

The proposed 24-month STEM extension would have a big impact on these students, giving them more time to get professional training and to finish better scientific research, which in turn will greatly benefit the advancement of science and technology in the US.

In the end, I'd like to say, it would be a great loss to our scientific research as well as the US if we lose those talented students. Our country really need professionals to support the science and technology sectors.
