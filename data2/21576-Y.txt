I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and an Air Force veteran, now working for a big data company. Some of the brightest students I met during my time at UW were foreign, who worked harder, studied longer, and were more thankful to be at that university than myself or most of my American peers. The thought that after all that hard work they put in, all the sleepless nights in the library, the constant updates to parents who saved for decades to send their child to an American university, they would be sent back home, not because of a lack of interest from employers, but because of an American government that won't let them stay, is upsetting. 

In the long run smart and talented immigrants don't take jobs from Americans, they create jobs. My mother was an immigrant, and she co-founded a company that employs 80 people in Madison.

As an average student in a STEM major, I'm in the likely pool of people that may not have a job if we allowed all foreigners to stay. But instead of telling my government to keep the competition out, I'm asking to let them stay. Let us compete. It will ensure my company has more a talented employee. It will ensure my client has a more talented analyst. It will make me work harder and produce more. These are bright, dedicated individuals that already want to stay and contribute to the American economy. Why are we stopping them?
