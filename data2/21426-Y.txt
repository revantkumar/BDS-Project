Many people didn't check this in the text of this law: 

"Safeguarding U.S. Workers Through Measures Consistent With Labor Market Protections". 

This law is NOT AGAINST any U.S. citizen's interest, when competing for the same position, the foreigners are definitely still having more difficulty now - they are not supported specifically by any of this kind of policy. This is a fair rule in my point of view and I support it should pass.
