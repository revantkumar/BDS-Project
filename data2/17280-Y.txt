Dear DHS, 

Thank you for your time preparing and providing international student an oppurtunity to get the real life job oppurtunity via STEM extension. We get to learn a lot and i fully support the STEM extension program.

Everything proposed by DHS is benificial for STEM students, until i read about the mentorship and training program. I am a STEM student working in enginnering field. when i find about the stem extension i was happy and equally sad to know that my manager have to fill the form and take all responsibilty about training and mentorship. Altough it is benificial to have these kind of training and mentorship program, it would be burden for most of the firm to proof and take extra burden while hiring STEM graduates. So please consider the mendatoey need to provide the proof for these mentoring program.
