I am a partly retired college professor and I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over our own graduates, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With many graduates struggling to find jobs, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreigners over U.S. citizens.
