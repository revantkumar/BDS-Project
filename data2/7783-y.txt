Greg Greiner OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.
Is this why SS is going to run out of money in future years, I paid my fair share in the 38 years of working and expect others to do the same even if from another country. If they end up staying in the U.S. then that cost will be covered, if not Americans win a bonus for helping them out!
