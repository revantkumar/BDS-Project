As part of international community, I strongly support the new proposal that Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. 

It is known that international students bring a lot income of both universities and government. 

Income consists of not only tuition, but also other income related to international students. To be more specific, independents of international students may comes to USA and spend a lot of money here while not occupy any job opportunity. Also some families may migrate to USA through business migrant way mainly because of their children study in USA. The big investment could activate economy of USA. Then, international students would travel a lot during holiday such as Christmas and Thanks Giving. Traveling costs a lot of money and this is apparently another part of income. 

Generally, international students bring a lot of money to USA, which can help USA activate its economy.
