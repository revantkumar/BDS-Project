Yan Huang I strongly support the STEM OPT extension proposal for the following reasons:

1.In today's US market, high-tech companies hire lots of highly skilled graduates. This indicate that these companies in U.S. do have huge demand on STEM graduates. Canceling OPT doesn't necessarily means that American graduates will fulfill those positions easily. STEM-majored students, particularly master graduates, are mainly international students. U.S. can expects huge contributions on innovation and ground breaking research from these highly-skilled talents by giving them work permit to stay in U.S.
2.International students pay a high tuition to U.S. University. They also bring commercial opportunities to local business, such as property-rental, supermarket, and restaurants. So STEM OPT extension will attract and motivate more international students to U.S. which will benefit U.S. economy as well.
