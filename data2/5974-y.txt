Lechan Wang I strongly support this rule. Almost all companies, organizations in America needs people with STEM background. The demand is huge. Allowing international students to extend their OPT can help fulfill the need and largely benefit those companies. Technology companies are especially in urge need for students with math, engineering, computer science background. Cutting their working visa will bring tremendous harm to ongoing or future projects for ongoing projects won't be finished in time and future ones will be delayed, negative economic impacts followed. Approving an extension of 24 months, on the other hands, will help companies accomplish major projects which usually take big amount of time. 
Additionally, 24-month OPT extension only applies to students with certain majors so the approval of this rule will not impair employment opportunities for citizens. This rule is beneficial to the country by all means.
