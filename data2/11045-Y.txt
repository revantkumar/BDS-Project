I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I am from China and I am pursuing my master degree in Mechanical Engineering. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide the industry training opportunity to STEM major students. OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. It will be a disaster to the most US engineering and high-tech companies if this rule is terminated.
