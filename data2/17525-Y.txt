I strongly support this rule, and with all my hope that it will be approved. If this rule were approved, more outstanding foreign students would be encouraged to come to the US for further education, because there would be more hope that they could find a job after graduation. Also, as we all know, IT companies are thriving and need more and more young, exceptional engineers from all over the world. Please approve this rule!
