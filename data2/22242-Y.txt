I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..
2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S.. A lot of people who make outstanding contributions are international students before. Many of them start companies, and increase emloyment opportunities of kinds of fields.
