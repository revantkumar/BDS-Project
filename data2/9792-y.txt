Jian Yuan I believe this is definitely a right decision to have a 24 month STEM Opt extension. For the long term, this can only bring benefit to the US, to the economy of this country.

As we all know, the US has always been famous for its great advanced education system. This great education system attracts and absorbs talented people from all around the world, and make the US be such a prosperous country. As one crucial part of this education system, Opt has played a critical role as it provides the opportunity of applying what international students have learned in school to the industry. I believe this is a win-win, as students can gain experience as the same time generating the wealth for the country. 

Currently, the Opt is only one year, which is relatively not enough because from the view point of the industry, I am not sure which institute is willing to hire a employee who can only stay for at most one year. The 24 month Opt extension is not long but it can give international students more chances to gain experience and give this country higher possibility to benefit from these talented students. And without a fair length of Opt, the attractiveness of the US education system may degrade, which will leave a negative effect in the long term.

I noticed that some native Americans might think the involvement of international students are causing the problem the unemployment in the US. But instead of not having the Opt extension, is it a better solution that the native Americans improve their own competitiveness in the job market? I believe competition makes perfect. Besides, the international students have already encountered many constraints when seeking jobs, like the requirement for citizenship for some jobs. 

Thanks a lot for taking your time to review this comment, and I think the Opt extension brings no harm but only benefits to both the US and international students.
