I strongly SUPPORT this proposal because:

1. If the proposal is not approved, tens of thousands of F-1 students with OPT will be enforced to leave and it will immediately impact their companies and even the industries. 

3. F1 students are not competing with U.S. citizens for their jobs. OPT will be only issued for those jobs which there's no U.S. citizen candidate for.
