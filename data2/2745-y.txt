Xijia Wang I strongly support this policy.

OPT extension provide a win-win situation for both people from US and students from other countries who need it. 

For people from US, this policy can attract more elite to stay in the US and make contribution to make US more competent. And for students, they can have better research environment here in US which will in turn improve here substantially.

Some people complain that this would make them more like to lose jobs. Does it make sense? No, they lost job only because they haven't find what's suitable for them to do. There is no such contradiction between elite students and people who lost their jobs.

I hope people can think of it from long term perspective.
