Dannis Levitt I am writing to support the proposed rule that aims to extend the F-1 OPT STEM extension while imposing new/tighter regulations. The negative feelings some expressed on this site root in their bias and misconception that confining domestic competition can solve the problem or dissatisfaction they have with the job market. The job market has been globalized for a long time. It might be true that in the STEM area or particularly IT industry, citizens are feeling growing pressure from international students, but one has to acknowledge that these booming industries, e.g., IT, which has been one of the driving forces of the US economy after the recession, must give their thanks to the diligent working ethic and innovative spirit of foreign graduates/workers who work legally in the US. The stimulation they created for the economy as a whole largely outweighs the downside that citizens are facing more competition. More job opportunities are created for citizens because of the effort of the nonimmigrant students. The narrow-minded notion that by confining local job market competition will gain any benefit can only harm the US as a whole, undermining its creativity, and competitive edge over other fast-growing countries and regions. If one thinks those effects maybe indirect, then a direct effect one will see soon if the STEM extension is cancelled would be in the education sector. International students have become a major source of revenue for schools as well as local government. A degree acquired without practicing/working experience will significantly diminish the value of the education foreign students can expect, and accordingly, their willingness to come. That can only harm the economy as a whole and weaken the competitiveness of the US in the global job market.
