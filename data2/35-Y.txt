YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension.

Educational institutions are dedicated to attract more outstanding foreign students because they want to build a community with cultural diversity. In addition, international students will pay higher tuition, which is a source of funding for the school. For those international students who get a fellowship, they are very talented with strong academic background, who will actively contribute to core research and projects of their field. As an international student who pays $50,000 tuition per year, I still chose to come to the U.S. because of this training opportunity and the extension after graduation, which allows me more time to strengthen what I have learned and gain more experience before I go back to my own country. If OPT and STEM OPT extension are not allowed, I might choose to go to other countries, so do most of my friends.

Most comments state that international students take job opportunities away from Americans. This is NOT TRUE. 1) OPT and STEM OPT extension restrict foreign students to positions related to their majors ONLY. The number of positions that we could apply is a very small number compared to the big job market. 2) Despite the fact that high tech companies hired some international students in the past several years, they are still in need of more talented engineers every day, which means there are not enough local Americans who can fill these positions. Therefore, the competition most comments here talked about is still between local Americans for the positions that we cannot apply.
