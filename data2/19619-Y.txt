I hope the majority of Americans can understand that the success of the US being the No.1 superpower in the world depends heavily on its ability to constantly attract and provide irresistible opportunities for foreign elites. Therefore, it is foolish to implement restrictions on STEM to stop all these advanced ideas and intelligent brains from coming in. In addition, it is widely acknowlegded that more and more Americans are living off their government subsidies instead of working hard like they used to be. For example, the increasing pressure on the social security system indicates that the senior population of America requires more young workers to support them.
