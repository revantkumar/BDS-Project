I think this is a great idea which would benefit America's economy! I believe the reason why many people come to America for a degree rather than any other country is that America provide better training opportunity. And many research program require more than two years. If OPT time is too short, it would be a disaster for both the company and workers. Many companies, especially high-tech companies would suffer a lot without OPT extension. And it would also bring a lot of opportunities to America's economy, since foreign students contributes a significant amount of money. Without this extension, they may prefer to go to other countries with their money and skills.
