Under the guidelines of this newly proposed rule "U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary...it can be above $10,000." This undermines the effort of American youth to pay back student loans and significantly hurts their willingness to support their country (I.e. Taxes). Leave it to our government to turn its back on the needs of its youth.
