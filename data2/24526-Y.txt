If the students is forced to leave US after one year OPT, it would be a loss for the company, since the former students is an experienced associate. Therefore, it is loss for the company because of the time and money devoted to train her and the time and money to recruit a new experience ones.

As for the industry I am in, the IT auditor, it is valuable for the company to have an experienced staff and it is hard to recruit another experienced because as far as I know, my company, a big accounting firm ,spent two months to fill the experienced staff position regardless to say a senior position.

In all, it would impact a lot of students who are now at the end of one year OPT. There are a lot of positions needed to be filled soon. by comparing the insufficient number of experienced people, the work of the company would slow down and the economy would also be impacted.
