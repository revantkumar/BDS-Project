There is a difference between an H1b hired directly from any other country and an OPT stem graduate of US universities.
Most of the comments here state that the people getting employed are less skilled than Americans or they are working for lesser wages than Americans. 
While this may or may not be true in case of H1Bs, this is definetly not true for an OPT stem graduate of US universities. OPT Stem graduates are hired on merit and are paid the same salary as any American citizen. So they in no way have any advantage over American citizens. They are technically skilled, and hence companies hire them.
And this regulation is for OPT stem graduates.
So please don't confuse H1B stuff with OPT stem graduate stuff.
