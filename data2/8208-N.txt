The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program is a terrible idea for American workers. By hiring foreigners, corporations can pay them less and not pay the SS tax making them more desirable to hire. Why do foreigners continue to get advantages that Americans do not? The government is supposed to be working for US citizens NOT foreigners. Stop this madness...now!
