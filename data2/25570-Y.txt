I strongly support the new regulation! If students who are studying in the U.S. all go back to their own country after years of training, they will soon create value for their countries that will one day compete with the U.S. companies. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S instead of using its own education to nurture its competitors.
