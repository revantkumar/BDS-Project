I endorse the rule as it will truly make America stay competitive.
There are people arguing how good they are, how many experience they have and now can't find a job because company don't want to pay benefits but have to work in target for $10 per hour. Clever people will easily know this is a fraud statement. One with professional experience can at least lower the expectation on salary to get much better pay. DON'T try to fool the government in this way because it only shows how awful you are and can't even tell a better lie!
