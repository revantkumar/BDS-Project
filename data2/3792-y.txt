Katherine Young International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century. One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity.
