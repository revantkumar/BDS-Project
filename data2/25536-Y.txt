I strongly support this rule. OPT program can remain U.S. academic sector's competitive globally. It is one very important reason why international student choose United State instead of other countries to finish their undergraduate or graduate degrees. The longer of duration of OPT, the more attractive of international student to study in United State. For STEM students, 24 months OPT extension can give them enough work experience and time to finish their project and training program. It can have only good results.
