I strongly support this 24 months extension rule. It is the modern civilization makes America the strongest country in the world. People come from different country different racial united together make America stand at the peak of this age. Opt extension for STEM shows the great intelligence and the inclusiveness of America. Many American citizen contributed to the education system and help international students get the most advanced knowledge. Then what? Just forcing them out of America? Why don't we make them service for the country? Opt extension is the most important thing for the country to keeping developing. It strengthen America and weaken others. What if it is cancelled? It means American people force other people beaten Uncle Sam! Is there any American citizen can bear this suffering?!
