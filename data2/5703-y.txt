Longfei Sun As the citizen, I strongly support this new OPT regulations. 

First of all, no matter how long the new OPT would be extended, the chances of getting H1 Visa would not be changed, so someone might worry about if the OPT was extend, there must be more and more new immigration come to the USA, and that might threaten some native citizens. Actually, it's not. So citizens won't worry about that. 

Secondly, three years for a STEM student to enough to practice what they've learnt in their major. If they could get the new OPT for practice almost three years, work with the professions. I believe most of the international students would love to go back to their country, after all, three years would be done in a completely experiment, not like before, the experiment wasn't not completely done, but the deadline of the OPT, students obligate to leave to the USA, that for the students, they cannot explore, and for the school, they cannot get the result. 

Thirdly, the financial lead in. The OPT might be one of the most attractive things that most of STEM students choose come to study in the USA other than British or Europe. For one side, we Americans could absorb some excellence resources to come with us study together, for the other side, every year, the huge amount of tuition could help our more native citizens to get the debit and scholarship from school, we could get more chances to study in the school. 

In the end, I want to strive for this new OPT regulation, not for me, for all of our Americans.
