Xinyuan Ai I strongly support this new proposal as I think it would be really money-saving and talent-keeping for both IT industry and the financial services industry here in the United States.

The essential reason is just that a lot of developers, modelers and quants working in these companies hold OPT work authorization extended for STEM degree holders. It takes really long time and a lot of resources to interview other candidates (with other types of work authorization) if these people have to leave the country just because there's not enough time left on their OPT work authorization. 

It is also worth mentioning that a lot them are really smart and hard-working, therefore, it would be a huge loss, not only to the company but also to this country, if they do not have enough chance to contribute their talents to those industries.

Thank you for considering my comment.
