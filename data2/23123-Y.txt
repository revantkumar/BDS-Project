Please understand the tough situation for any foreign students, all they want were just to gain the knowledge and work experiences, this is a group of young, energetic, and hard working people who could definitely contribute to the this country. They are not asking to take any benefit from the government. If US government could have the big heart to take all the Mexican workers, why can't we give those students a chance?
