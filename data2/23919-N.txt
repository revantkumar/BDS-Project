No other country uses every tool in its arsenal, regardless of legality or ethics, to allow foreign nationals to take jobs from American students and workers. A true country puts the welfare of its own citizens first and foremost.

Every country has a spectrum of workers, from exceptional to poor, but only ours brings in foreigners to take opportunities from all but good-exceptional workers. Other countries help all of their people find opportunities for which they are suited or could become suited.

Why are we throwing 10s of millions of our people under the bus and putting them on the dole instead of helping them contribute to making us better?
