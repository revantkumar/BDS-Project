I support this OPT extension! Actaully, I myself am was using OPT period of time get trained and help the company I was interning in, which bring dual benefits. Now I'm still working in the US using H1b and I'm pride to be a tax-payer and contributing to this country. If not OPT program, I would not have this chance. So I'm a full supporter for it!
