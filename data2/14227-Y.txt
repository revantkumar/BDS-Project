I am definitely support this opt-extension policy and the opportunity provided for international studentsis both beneficial for them and the Americans prospect. 
The number of international students in the USA is increasing every year in the recent ten years. The number in 2014 has reached 880,000. One important reason for that is USA can provide the Optional Practical Training opportunity for them to utilize what they learn in American universities. On the other hand, they are great incentives for local economies. Among the foreign students, most of them are paying their own tuitions, which are much higher than US citizens, and they also could spend 30,000 dollars each year for renting apartments, travelling and other living expenses. We can see that because of the increasing foreign students, many college towns have been economically booming, for instance, Ann Arbor, College Station. 

The proposed opt extension regulation is applied to STEM graduate, which meets the demand from high-tech industry. They are important asset to companies. Some people would be worried about that the foreign students are stealing jobs from US citizens. I think that is not reasonable. The fact is that companies are more inclined to hire Americans when candidates have similar background since foreign students need H1B visa if they want to work for a longer time. As a consequence, only more qualified and promising foreign students are received job offers from companies. In regard of that, the opt-extension enable those qualified international graduate to make contributions to the American Industry.
