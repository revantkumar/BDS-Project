I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. I've got five grandchildren that have either recently entered the job market or will be entering it in the next few years after college graduation. What chance do they have to compete against foreign workers can be paid less than even the minimum wage and employers do not have to pay social security withholding; It's a no brainier. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens
