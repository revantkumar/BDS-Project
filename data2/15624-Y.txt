I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should allow international students to stay longer because of employment market demands of them. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. American people work harder to outcompete those international students if competition is present. The outcome is that the country produces more better people, more people who could contribute more to the society.
