Fauzia Deeba Yes of course, I support the OPT Program. In fact, I thought that it was there all the time...!! I was on OPT in 2004, so how come I have to sign a campaign to 'start' OPT now...?? If its not in place for any reason, then I urge that F-1 (and J-1 too) OPT Program for STEM Degrees be started ASAP. 
Thank you.
