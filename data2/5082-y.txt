chen jingling As a visiting student in Stanford University, I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule. Here are the following reasons.

1. Improve US companies' competence. 
One of the most important reasons that US high-technical companies leads the industries is because of hiring many talents from the world, not just restricted in US. Many companies will benefit this extension rule because they could search more international students to work for the USA.

2. Benefit for academic sectors
Many people chose USA instead of other countries partly because of the OPT. If OPT is extended to 36 months, there will be more international students prefer to register in USA universities, paying academic fees and spending money in USA.
