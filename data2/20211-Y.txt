My company has a lot of non-immigrant students and they are working perfectly fine. They filled the positions that are in desperate need -- we can't find suitable U.S. citizens for such positions. If they are required to leave the states, it will result in hundreds of vacancies in our company, which would be disastrous!! THEY ARE MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SOCIETY AND WORKING FOR US. I don't see the harm of keeping them for a little longer.
