Akash Joshi Studying in the United States is a costly investment for most international students. This is especially true for students from South Asian countries where income levels are far lower than salaries in USA. When I decided to study in the US for a master's degree, the rule stated that OPT was for 29 months. Me and most of my international friends calculated that working for 29 months would suffice to recover the costs for the degree. However, the judgment which removed the OPT period from 29 months to 12 months scared me as firstly, no employer would like to hire a candidate who can only work for twelve months and secondly, the student debt would crush me financially. 

I do not mind if the rule for OPT extension is canceled if it goes against the interest of American nationals. However, such a rule should be implemented in phases which would give international students a fair chance to make rational and informed decisions which might not be financially detrimental to them.

I also do not believe that companies hire international students to save payroll taxes. I believe that almost all companies hire an employee based on merit. Companies should pay their fair share of taxes irrespective of the nationality of the employee.
