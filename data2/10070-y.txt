Cuixia Li I strongly suggest the extension of OPT program to be another 24 months.
The extension of OPT will be beneficial for increasing the U.S domestic consumption, which then will add value to the growth of U.S GDP, for the good of the prosperity.
These OPT students have the daily consumption such as supermarkets, restaurants, rent or housing, tourist, education and training and so on. The increase of the consumption will enlarge the aggregate demand, which then will create more job opportunity for U.S citizens. According to NAFSA, international students have contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S economy, which create 340,000 job opportunities for the local people. If the OPT extension is granted, we can see a larger growth. However, if it is not granted, these students will tell their families and friends to choose other Countries instead of U.S, which will not be a good thing to the U.S economy.
Therefore, it will be a win-win situation if U.S can grant this new plan ASAP.
Thanks.
