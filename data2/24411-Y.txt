I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
(1) It will benefit both US economy and education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.(2) It will bring more diversities and energy into IT area of United States.
(3) It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.
