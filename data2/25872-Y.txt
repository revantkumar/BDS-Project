I support the extension of OPT. I've never thought that f-1 students will threaten the opportunities of local people finding a job. They contribute to the engineering industries of the United States. They help to solve the immediate economic and social problems of the United States in an uninjurious to other people. This is quite obvious to us since people in the United States have received the benefit from f-1 students' contribution to the whole industries.
