Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. Many of my friends will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule. 

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. Im particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. I am glad my international colleagues are able to gain practical training experience in the US because we need to ensure all successful college graduates have a chance to join the US workforce if they so desire. Many of our brightest minds are immigrants, and our current system of allocating H1B visas forces many would be immigrants back home. This issue is especially acute for STEM majors who have the technical skills to make America a better nation and community.

I am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule making process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule. 

The extension allows students additional attempts at the H1B lottery, and reduces the risk potential employers feel about hiring international students out of college.

Please help make the US a stronger and more diverse country by extending OPT.

Best regards,
