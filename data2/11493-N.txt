I am asking DHS to stop this madness concerning the expansion of the OPT program. This program is an assault on American STEM employees and Americans studying those fields.

Why is it a good idea to allow foreign students employment in our country, with a possible path to an H1B visa, while half of American STEM workers cannot find jobs in their fields? Also, wages are being suppressed by this practice, and payroll taxes are not being paid.

It is doubly offensive that DHS is more concerned with assisting tech companies and foreign students than preserving good paying jobs for American people.

What a disgrace that this program is not only in effect, but being considered for an expansion to boot!
