I strongly support the stem OPT extension for F1 students. Cancelling this policy will not bring more jobs for US citizens, but dead economy and noncompetitive technology will definitely drag the US to a sad place! I believe the day that US has no attraction to the foreign talents is the day the US lose its power and definitely more US CITIZENS will lose their high-pay jobs.
