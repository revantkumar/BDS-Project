Leah Davies International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. If this rule is not passed, foreign STEM grads will take their skills and education to their home countries, costing America the opportunity for job-creating innovation. Even with more than 13 million Americans unemployed, the manufacturing sector cannot find people with the skills to take nearly 600,000 unfilled jobs, according to a study last fall by the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte.
