Greetings,

I'm a U.S. Citizen and a registered voter. I remind all who are concerned, that Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned. I support this as it was originally written. I submit my thought that this continue to be used for all qualified foreign students to help them learn only for the intention to bring this knowledge back to their home Country. This is not to be offered to those that wish to remain in the U. S.
