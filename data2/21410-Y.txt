I fully support this regulation.
America's economy significantly relies on high-tech industry. One of the most important factors that America has world's first class high tech companies is that it has access to world's brightest elites. I work for a famous high tech company in silicon valley and I have numerous colleges who are from different countries. They are all smart, nice and hard working. Without them, I can't imagine the company being same great. Some people oppose to the regulation because they think having too many immigrants will lower the wages of employees but this is not the case. If you come to silicon valley, you will know how much a company is willing to pay for a talented people and how hard it is for them to find one. There are too few rather than too many talents to support this industry. 
Given the current H1B situation, many talented people are forced to leave the country when they lose the lottery. How can those high tech companies continue to be advanced if they can't hire the most talented people? These people are irreplaceable and they are NEEDED for high tech industry. 
Therefore I will strongly support this rule.
