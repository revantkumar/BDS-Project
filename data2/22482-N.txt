The DHS revision to the OPT program is simply another attempt at an end-run around Congress and the Judicial arms of the Federal Government by the Obama Administration. This not only is detrimental to the core of young American graduates who seek work with American industry, but also focuses greater power and control in the Executive Branch - which is counter to Constitutional principles. This attempt should be rejected.
