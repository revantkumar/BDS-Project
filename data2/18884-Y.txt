I think this OPT extension proposal for non-immigrant F-1 students is really crucial to the states and should be approved by the federal government. Nowadays the prosperity of any country is relying on science and technology much more than ever. We have already seen how the States by its incomparable science and technology power influenced and changed the world in the past 20 years. Big names like IBM, Microsoft, Google, Apple not only changed the way people live but also gained themselves great wealth. It is hard to imagine how the States would be today without these landmark companies. Scientific research is of equal importance: it serves both as the very foundation of technology growth and reaches out to find possible directions of the human society. 

But we all know that the sustainable improvement of both tech industry and scientific research, however, relies highly on students graduating from STEM majors. And one fact we cannot ignore is that a significant proportion of STEM students are non-immigrant international students. Now all international graduates have to face an annual H1B lottery draw to obtain a legal working permit in the U.S.. Had we limit their time for OPT extension, much less of them would succeed in finding a job in the U.S., which would be a great loss for the states. Given this 24-month extension they will be more comfortable to find a job, attend multiple H1B draws, and more likely to plan their career in the U.S. and make contributions to this society.

As a F-1 student in STEM, I really appreciate the chance that I can study in the States and probably enter the S&T industry in the future. Going back to my motherland for policy reasons may or may not be a catastrophe for me, but losing hundreds of thousands of talents from all over the world is definitely a great loss for the States.
