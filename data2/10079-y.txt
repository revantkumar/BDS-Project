Karen Li When I started to apply for college in 2008, STEM OPT extension was just in effect. This was a very attractive news at that time and one of many reasons I decided to study in the US instead of going to other countries with superior college education. As an international student for the past 6 years, I have not only paid my tuition in full and also spend at least $50000 dollars a year to the american economy for rent, living expenses, travel, and etc. 

I am currently in my OPT period and working at a company as data analyst. I believe the OPT extension policy with 2 more years will be very helpful to utilize my knowledge and contribute to the fast growth of my company. 1 year is too short for most students to really contribute to the growth of their company because most students will go though a training period and couple of more months to really adjust to the work environment. When they really can start to do the real job, they may have to face the cure reality that they did not get H1b and are forced to go back to their home country for work. This situation can cause US companies millions of dollars spent in training and not getting what they need afterwards. As there the students studying in STEM majors are mostly international students, the companies have to go through this process every year, which is very costly for the US economy.

All in all, I believe OPT extension is a policy that is win-win for both international students and US companies/economy. International students under OPT are mostly paid the same salary as companies' other staffs and they are very talented and hardworking. As a country welcoming talents from all over the globe, United States should work hard to welcome and help international students to live in the US and contribute to the US economy, not returning back to their home country and work for companies that compete with US companies.
