I support this rule,DHS took good decision at right time.I think OPT should be extended for 36 months as the H1B quota is Increasing gradually, which may reduce the chances for OPT students to get H1B.internatinal students bring lot of money
from home country to invest in USA to gain lot of skills onces they graduate with good profile if you ask them to go back to home country without giving them proper chance to get work experience.i am pretty sure international students will prefer some other countries.so, USA will see lot of changes in economy so i request USA gov to agree DHS decision
