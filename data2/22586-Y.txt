I strongly support the OPT extension regulations.I think this regulation not only effect the international students but also the native Americans.
Few of our university American students are on the STEM major, If someone doubt that the extension may effect the work opportunity for the Americans, is not quite true.Actually,Most of the STEM field work labor lack of the talent people, such as the computer science field, engineering field.For America, it really needs the international students to fill in the blanket, and they can make effort to each other and to be win-win.What's more,these international students are not a group of cheaper labor, they serve more, and pay equally with the American people.Moreover,most of them are very talent to provide better and beneficial ideas for the company, which can help company make much more money. Based on this fact,we can not imagine what is a great lost if the company process without these great people. Someone mentions about the bad effect probably origin from the ICC companies, which take a lot of spot of the H1b visa.I think they are not only lower the salary of the work labor, but maybe some of them do not even have a qualified American education degree.
In my opinion, we need to support the OPT extension regulation, but take some action on these ICC companies, to improve the regulations.
