More than 98 million Americans are out of work and this is what congress is doing to improve the situation? We did not elect this
this congress to be politically correct but to do the will of the people which has been ignored by all government officials. Oppose this
bill or next time around you will feel the wrath of the people next time is your time to run for office again!
