I have no idea that why people who can not get jobs vent their anger on OPT STEM extension. This rule is totally FINE. I strongly approve this program. The real reasons burn out our working opportunities are outsourcing firm. They owns a lot foreigns without high education who come from overseas. This is crazy. 
We need more appropriate job openings for people. There is no contradiction with people who work in high tech field. Why we ban the real well-education students and allow outsourcing firm expanding? This rule is innocent. American people need let talented staying in and forbid these outsourcing firm
