Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am vehemently opposed to further expansions of F-1 program or other similar programs. Before extending these programs, we must enhance development of our own young people. We have brilliant minds in many of our own young people that are being unfairly downcast into secondary opportunities as your policies have favored foreign students and lower cost foreign labor over our own citizens. You creating a subservient class out of our own young minds.

Our first responsibility is to our citizens and then to others around the world. 

Thanks you for your time.

Respectfully submitted,

Lyle Orth
