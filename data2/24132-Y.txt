I absolutely support this proposal by DHS to amend its F-1 nonimmigrant student visa regulations on OPT for certain students with degrees in STEM from U.S. accredited schools of high education.

I believe that the OPT is a really important part of higher education so that it gives the students an unique opportunity to apply the knowledge they learn from class on solving problems in the real world. The 24 months extension will definitely enhance the expertise of these students as mentioned above and offer them a much better chance for them to serve both united states and their own countries. Moreover, these students are young, talent, and well-educated, and they have passions to change and world and improve our life. What they need is practice, experience, and opportunities, and no doubt that this proposal will open a new door for these pioneers to realize their dreams.
