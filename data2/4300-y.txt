Ritu Sirkanungo I am in strong support for the 24 months OPT extension proposal. The United States has always been providing outstanding higher education to students all across the world. OPT extension raises chance for the US employers to benefit from these US educated well trained international STEM students. It would allow employers to get to know the market and market strategies of their home countries. It would also help international students to prove themselves to be a great asset for the company. Students will work hard and acquire and share more knowledge, and thus would employ huge benefits to the companies all across the US.
