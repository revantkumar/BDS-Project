I think the new rule is both important and necessary to both STEM students and US. For me, extended OPT could help me gain more practice on the subjects I leaned. And this practice is hard to gain either in university or short-time due to the complexity of engineering. For United States, engineering is the nature of the most of industries, which highly impact the economy. The extended OPT will enable STEM students use the knowledge they leant to help the growth of the economy.
