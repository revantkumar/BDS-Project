I think the opt extension for STEM are very necessary. 
1,U.S.A is one of the most advanced and open country, and attracting more and more excellent students to stay in America and devote their talents to this country is very important. 
2,We know that there exist large number of international students majoring in STEM in U.S.A. Most those students are come from countries like China, India and other developing country. They study hard to be admitted by America's university to pursue a STEM degree. And they deserve a more sufficient time to practice what they learn in U.S.A. Obviously, the OPT extension attributes this purpose. Also, if U.S.A adopts a more strict rule for international STEM students, then more and more excellent genius will have to come back to their country for the limited time to let them show their talents. We know if one country spends lots of resource nourishing large number of talents but could not grab their hearts, then the country will also lost its big advantage and chance to keep the best station.
3,Besides, I am sure U.S.A has enough space and resource to support those potential STEM students, after all, what they consume is just some cups of milk and chicken, but they contribute to a more advanced country.
4, At fast, do not forget those STEM students will not steal more jobs from American. On the contrast, many STEM students chose to start up their own companies in U.S.A, which obviously offer more positions to public that including many domestic guys.

Therefore , I strongly recommend we could give that extension to all STEM students!!!
