I strongly support this rule. First, it benefit the country by using more foreign "talents". Someone may say that this is a threat to native STEM students, but I don't think so. See the job fairs across the country, we have many many companies starving for engineers!! From my point of view, I have received lots of emails from my friends asking for recommend talents to work in their companies. Second, it may benefit the students, they can get the chance to learn more. And this policy will encourage them to work harder and make more contributions!!
