I am opposed to this rule(s). OPT will harm American citizen's who are STEM graduates themselves. It provides financial benefits for companies to hire foreign students, which will undoubtedly give those students an unfair advantage in the hiring process. The idea of our government aiding foreigners over their own citizens is frankly UNAMERICAN. If preferences are to be dolled out, then please provide them to our own citizens. I urge you to backtrack on this proposed rule(s).
