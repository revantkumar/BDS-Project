I am an international student and am strongly for this bill. I paid a higher tuition and did a good job during the two year graduate program. I feel unfair if the extension is getting cut since it's one of the reasons for me to decide to come here to do the program. If it's getting cut, I have only one chance to get the working visa. And the potential employer would take into consideration of the uncertainty and actually as I know, some firms have decided to stop hiring international students. I hope the courts would have some sympathy on us. America is an immigration country. It is the immigrants who made up this country and continue to contribute to this country.
