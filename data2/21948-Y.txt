I am diligently in favor of the proposed new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe the proposed increased duration of optional practical training (OPT) is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. The reason students come to this wonderful country, to get the pioneering education that US is known for. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness. As my current experiences outlay the fact the the recruiting firms are a bit hesitant with hiring due to the short time period. This will allow smaller firms to hire more international student which could eventually lead to growth of the smaller firms and lead to a greater uniformity in capital gains.
