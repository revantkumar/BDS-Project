I Support the Extension of STEM OPT for 24 months. It is a gateway of students who came to USA with many hopes . This extension will not only give chances to students as well as all the immigrants who come here with some scope .
We need this for this country's future as well. We want to work LEGALLY ! 

Who ever is opposing this , I don't know even why are they opposing , please make sure your reasons need to be Practical and well thought ! This in no way affects your future . Imagine the country with out international students and you will get a clear Picture of STEM EXTENSION is needed for 24 months .
Students are the country's Pride , who use their talent to let the company's develop financially and develop word technically . 

DONT LET THEM GO !! FIGHT FOR STEM EXTENSION FOR 24 MONTHS.
