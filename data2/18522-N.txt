The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. With millions of Americans unable to find work it is unconscionable that your department would contemplate extending a program that gives incentives to companies to hire these F-1 students. Since these worker pay no FICA taxes, these much needed revenues, which would be paid by American workers, result in a loss to Social Security and Medicare. 

We live in southern California and have personally observed the heart wrenching replacement of American workers by Southern California Edison and Disney, many who had to train their replacements. Since these companies already had competent workers in these jobs, the only reason they were replaced is because the incoming workers were CHEAPER! So, please, no excuses that there is a worker shortage in this country because that is a lie. Which further begs the question, why can't these same training programs be offered to our American citizens to be able to find employment.

All things considered, this is just a shadow program of the H-1B program which is already too expansive. Since 2000 virtually all new jobs have gone to immigrants which is why our labor participation rate is at 1977 levels. You need to first assure all American citizens who want work can find it. In other words, look at the BIG PICTURE before you start increasing the flow of foreign workers who end up displacing American workers. Like we said in the beginning, your first duty is to Americans!!!
