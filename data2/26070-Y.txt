Strongly support OPT extension. The international students contributes a lot to economy development. Think about Uber. The high-tech create so many jobs for US people. Think about the excellent search engines provided by google! Think about iphone by Apple! Thousands of international students stand behind all of these. When you drive these people out, you will only see the US is losing to other countries and that is the real time people are losing their job. 
Some people say the international students get the low pay and try to replace US worker. This is not true. Most international students got highly paid job. They are good and companies need their talent, so the companies hire them. 
Some people said international students take advantage of us resources, This not true either. They pay tax, insurance, they pay everything they need. They are legal !!!! Why should they be driven out of the country even if they have job here?
Some people said OPT program is not fair to local students, This not true either. Look at the job fair post: http://issuu.com/upitt/docs/career_fair_2015. Less than 40% companies will sponsor international students. Besides, the local students have more connections and they can easily find job. It is non-sense to claim the international students take the job away from local students. 
Please take effect OPT extension for the good of US.
