I strongly support the proposal. One thing that attracts so many tech talents around world to study in the U.S. is that U.S. has a good policy for these foreign students to work and practice after graduation. Now many countries are trying to adopt similar policies to attract STEM students to work and contribute to them. The extension of OPT for STEM students could help the U.S. to compete with those countries for the top talents.
