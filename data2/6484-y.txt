Mengshan Jin I strongly support this proposed rule because, first it gives more opportunity for talented foreigners to work in IT and other Engineering areas, which will have positive effects on US economy. Second, America's spirits are freedom and democracy. That's one of the reasons why there are so many students who want to study in US every year. US should treat these students equally. Lastly, this rule will also be good to US education as more students will be attracted to get higher education in US. It will be a win win outcome for US and foreign students!
