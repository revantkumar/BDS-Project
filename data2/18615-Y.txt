I definitely support this proposal. International STEM students have made big contributions to our economy, they paid for the tuition, they spend money when they are living here, and most importantly, they can contribute after graduation. 

Without the extension program, how can we attract STEM students come here any more? How can we keep this huge market any more? 

Some of us said STEM students have taken away jobs from us, it's not true. This proposal directly pointed out that it requires "Safeguard for US workers in relative fields". Companies are required to put Americans first when hiring, and we hire people based on the fitness to position and the person's skill. STEM students are needed when there is fewer Americans in typical field, and in many areas, it happens!
