I strongly support this proposed rule and believe this will continue to keep the US on the forefront on science and engineering related disciplines. Just to give a simple example, the most powerful supercomputer in the world every year is most of the time from China and Japan, while it is also sometimes from the US. Such things in science and engineering are very important to keep a country powerful in different aspects (military, economy, etc); and the US needs these skilled individuals from other countries to keep the country strong.
