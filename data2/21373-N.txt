How do you tell your children what the definition of " ILLEGAL" is when our politicians have no clue? My wife & myself have no problem with legal aliens, but absolutely despise those clueless politicians who skirt the law or just plain ignore it. We are no longer represented by them. Another example is our hard earned dollars we put into Social Security ( SS ). LBJ stole millions if not billions of it & put the private fund SS dollars into the general fund. Replaced by worthless IOU's.Now the Government tells us that SS is going broke! Give me a break! Yet, going broke is never discussed about our hard earned tax dollars paying for welfare, food stamps, free education, free health care/medicine, free legal, free schooling, free pay increases on having children, free this, free that???? We're paying for that, not the Government! Much of this is going to ILLEGALS! All we can ask you is to see reality, look into the future & our survival. 
We absolutely MUST vote this clueless thieves of our honestly hard earned dollars out of office. They get their paychecks every month. What about the 100's of thousands LEGAL American citizens who are out of work? The mostly liberal Politicans are only thinking about themselves, not us--the ones they are supposed to represent. Again, vote for Americans who want to save our beloved Country, not the me only greedy corrupt, lying incompetent traitors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
