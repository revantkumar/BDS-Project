Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. 
Please do not expand this rule, it is crowding Americans out of these jobs. Why are we training foreign students? We should be putting this money to work training American students. Thus looks like another Obama scheme to flood the zone with foreign students that will always vote as Democrats in the future. Please stop this partisan nonsense! Thank you.
