Rubin Xu As a current employee in construction industry, I strongly support for 24-months extension. 
First of all, my current project ends at 2018 and if my OPT is terminated because of extension, that definitely will cause more money and time for next employee taking all my knowledge from previous part of this project. Same thing for other foreign employees. Less extension impact the project, especially in STEM field.
On the other side, longer extension does not hurt local people. It is more competitive between international students since H1B is a lottery system and the number is not growing up. Meanwhile, international students cannot stay if being unemployed over 90 days. 
Anyway, I would prefer if OPT extension can be 24 months period.
