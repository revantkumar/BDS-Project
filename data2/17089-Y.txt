I am a graduate student at University of Texas at Austin. I strongly support this proposal to expand the training opportunities for F-1 international students with STEM degrees. Here are my reasons.

1. This proposal will attract more international students to come to US for studying, which at least directly will stimulate the economy in US. The training opportunities are really important to international students. Lots of students choose to come to US instead of other countries for this training opportunity.

2. US needs to select more excellent people through this training process to help its economy.Diverse high-quality talents have helped US tremendously for decades. Giving more opportunities to international students is a good tradition in the history of US. Moreover, it really works very well. So we should stick with this policy and enhance it.

3. International students won't affect domestic students very much. Despite the competition, the number of international students is still very small compared with domestic students. International students just take some positions for which the company cannot find qualified domestic students. So international students help US business.

There are other future benefits of this proposal which cannot be specified here since it is just a comment. Based on the above reasons, I think the proposal is indeed beneficial to US economy. So I support this proposal.
