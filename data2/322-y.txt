Wesley Nicholson United States is a united country, and the most open country in the world. I do not understand why some part of people disagree for STEM OPT extension, they all struggle their best to get a job and work hard to keep the job. Furthermore, they contribute a lot to the whole community. For example, engineerings in google are improving the world every second and most of them are STEM students. Afterwards, they did not use a piece of resource from government before coming to USA and come to states after finishing study in university. What a benefit to keep them working in states! I strongly agree to extend the OPT for STEM degrees.
