Weijia Jia I definitely thumb up for the proposed rule. 

In the future, talented foreign people from all over the world are especially important for US economy. 

The best way to attract talents from the other countries to work for the US, or to have more talented and creative foreign students to come to study in the US, is to give them time and opportunities to practice here. The proposed rule will definitely do this job! 

I strongly support this rule. I am sure US will benefit a lot from this rule.
