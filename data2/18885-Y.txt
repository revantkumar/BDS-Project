I have a STEM PhD degree and, now working for a big pharmaceutical company with my OPT Extension. The OPT extension proposal would allow me to continue contributing my intelligence to develop medicines for the people of US and around the world. Our company is actually desperately looking for appropriate STEM major students due to the expansion. 

As far as I know, the pay for foreign STEM students is the same as US STEM students in the pharmaceutical industry. I believe that the new proposal can retain many smart STEM students working for the US and boost the US economy. The proposal will also help US to retain the most educated students in the world.
