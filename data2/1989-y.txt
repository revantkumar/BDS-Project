Xingpeng Li It would be good to limit OPT extension to the students with advanced degrees or only to PhDs (who graduated from accredit US universities). It would then have less pull backs and those PhDs are the top brains that US want to attract. Maybe should give 3 or more years extension so PhDs that industry and academia really want could have the chance get them H1B and stay here work for the US. 

And it has a very limited conflicts to the interests of US workers because it is such a small pool. PhD title from US universities is good enough to filter the no-so-smart brains, then what was left are the true elites that US want to keep.
