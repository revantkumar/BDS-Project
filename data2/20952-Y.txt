Every country needs highly educated people, for both of its academia and economy. But not every country is able to keep the talents. The United States has been such an open land for people from different countries. Most importantly,the United States really takes actions to help foreign educated students and scholars stay here making their contributions. 

Each year, there are hundreds of thousands of talented foreign students injected into United States. They have been making tremendous accomplishments in many different fields. As well as receiving substantial training after they finish the graduate work, F-1 students could continue making high-impact progress in science, engineering and technology. 

An F-1 OPT is an optimal strategy that provides graduated students much time and flexibility for their continuous contribution to US. For F-1 holders in academic institutes, 36 months of OPT period is no more than the average time period required for accumulation in production before they go back home countries. Educated by US institutes, some F-1 holders seek to utilizing their skills in industry. A 36 months OPT could just make their transitions a lot of easier. This new policy could also avoid some huge cost for industrial corporations to support H-1 visa because a portion of F-1 holders would like to go back their own countries eventually.

So why not make the OPT longer?
