Adesh Khandelwal America has been one of the most developed nations based on the companies that has supported its economy.
Intel, HP, Google, Facebook, IBM, Accenture, Cognizant, Yahoo, Linkedin: These are just some examples of companies that support the economy of US. One thing that is common to the all of them is technical expertise and ability to create revolutionary things. These things cannot be created by average people. You need people of specific technical expertise to achieve this. If USA does not encourage such people in their economy, other countries will prosper. USA will hit the nail on its head by giving away such talented people to other nations. Its a point to ponder. Dont you think.
Conclusion: USA needs stem workers and they should give them all the facilities to win them over.
