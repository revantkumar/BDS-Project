Bailong Kongzi As a PHD graduate in Mechanical Engineering from one of the top universitied. i strongly support this new regulation rule. I am currently on OPT and am a postdoc research fellow .I conducted two reseach projects which are supported by NASA and army research lab.These projects last many years and require more years to complete,to be honest, i think for PHD and postdocs of stem degree,they need more OPT extention even up to 3 years .
