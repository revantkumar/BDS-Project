Michael Lin I firmly support the proposal cause it really do help to U.S.

First of all, as what our government have done in the past hundreds of years, a lot of international students were allowed to studied and worked in America, which made a contribution to our economy and innovation. It's those smart and diligent people's efforts that makes U.S.A the strongest country in this world. So there is no reason to prohibit more and more excellent students from working in America.

Second, the reason that American's opportunity for getting a job will be reduced by competition with international student should be reputed. Actually, the unemployment rate has decreased to 5%, which means our economy is good enough to provide more jobs for new workers. What's more, American should be confident that we have the ability to compete with international students.

Thirdly, the more diverse students the more easy for society to raise activity. When all the best students study and work in one circumstance, a magical power will appear for the development of a country.
