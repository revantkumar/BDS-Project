I strongly support the 24-month STEM OPT extension for the reasons as follows:

* Those students who've finished at least a 4-year undergraduate STEM degree are typically highly skilled hardworking technical guys, a great potential high-quality workforce strongly demanded by US market. 
* The primary reason US citizens are against this proposal is because they are afraid of losing job opportunities due to the competition from international students. Instead of improving their own qualifications and skill sets, they rely on the government to externally impose a barrier preventing international students from obtaining job opportunities so that they could feel a sense of security. What a coward. Free and fair competition among employees is like that among goods. Any externally imposed barrier only benefits a certain group of people by sacrificing the interest of the society as a whole.
* The US's attractiveness to skilled young people from all around the world contributes a lot to it's continuous growth. US government should therefore give a green light to those policies further facilitating it.
