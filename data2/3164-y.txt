Yang Zhou Dear Administrator: 

This commment will focus on the US's competition problems.

I am really glad that the DHS propose a 24 month extention for STEM students. This will help us to stay here and contribute our intellegence.

Here, I will give several reasons to explain why the good OPT program can benifit US and the common people here. 

1.This point might be not very polite, but it is true. I am working with American students in the same lab every day, we are good friends. Although they are the best student in this university, from my pointview they don't work hard at all and also not work smart. Obvisouly, how local students can complain us taking their jobs because their laziness and narcissism.

2. Why the US can keep as the greatest country, because they don't spoil the young generation like European. They let the smart international students goes into US to add competition, and to remind the local students to keep alert. I have worked with several European students, I can not fell ambition and fast response at all. They will lose tomorrow.

3.I am dedicated in Power Electronis which is a branch of Electrical Enginerring. I like the engineering atmosphere in US's big companies. I hope to become an excellent engineer, and even write the professional book in the future. A lot of international students receive very good math and physics education. Every time when I discuss questions with American students, they said you have so good understanding on the basic problems. Yes, because we put into a lot of efforts into study, not bars ot partyies. 

It is wise for US goverment to keep us as fresh water here, to remind everyone here the water is still flowing, and US manufucture and technology's advantages can be replaced by other competitor.
