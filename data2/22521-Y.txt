I really think this proposal should be supported for the following reasons:

1) With longer opt extension, the foreigners with higher education background and top-level talents that is an innegligible portion in the contribution of US industrial, educational and economical aspects, can have long time to serve in various companies, which will strengthen the power of US science and technology and boost US economy in the long run

2) This would help both US universities and US employers to remain competitive in the global market.

3) The OPT extension exists since 2008, and the US economic keeps improving during this time. Whatever is has every reason for being.
