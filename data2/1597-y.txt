Yuanlong Yang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Government should give every international student who attended U.S university an equal opportunity, and let them keep making contributions to U.S.
2. If this proposal fail, U.S gonna lose thousands of high quality guest workers.
