The changes being recommended to the Optional Practical Training program definitely benefit foreign STEM participants and American economy.It's a win-win situation.
Allowing foreign exchange student study programs can benefit us all. We have to admit that we don't generate enough qualified STEM graduates and we need more OPT students to work for our tech companies.
We provide foreign students with high-class education and now it is time for them to feed back to America before they go bac k to their country.
The economy benefit a lot when trying to hold these talents in american as long as possible.
I strongly support the new changes to the OPT program
