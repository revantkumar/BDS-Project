The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.

This fucking insanity must stop and it must stop now. Why the hell does our government help provide jobs to foreigners while screwing the US citizens out of those opportunities. Our government now is worse than the worst mafia that has ever existed on this planet. No more jobs for the foreigners until every single US Citizen is fully and gainfully employed and we are a hell of a long way from that right now. The proof is in the number of people on food assistance in this country today. It is almost as bad now as it was at the worst of the last recession.
