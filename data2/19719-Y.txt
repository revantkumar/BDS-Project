I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
First, High-tech companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. hire so many foreign students to work for them, and these students were once F-1 students. If this proposal were denied, then so many students would be forced to leave america, then who would fill so many positions for these high-tech companies? Moreover, nowadays American economy greatly depends on high-tech companies.
Second, we all know and support the diversity in US. Foreign students receive education here in US and then they behave well, and they know how to respect and celebrate diversity. Thus allowing this proposal will greatly enhance the diversity of US, and bring great benefit to the society of USA.
Third, we have to admit that competition of foreign students and local american citizens does exist. However, we know that without competition, the society will lack of innovative, thus how can USA still have the latest technology?
In a word, I strongly support this proposal because it will bring so much benefit to USA!
