I got my PhD last year in the US and now working as a scientist in R&D of a mid-size biology company, with my OPT. In my group, more than half of the employees are not US citizens. These talented young people all hold advanced degrees and are all hard workers, who come to this country to make contributions using their knowledge and skills. My group is not an uncommon case in today's US high-tech industry. In the most famous and competitive companies in the US, foreign engineers/scientists are playing important roles. To some extent at least, it is them who are keeping the leading position of the US in the world by solving the most challenging problems, creating the most cutting edge innovations and fighting for their dreams. The US needs these highly educated and skillful people and OPT STEM extension is critical to keep them in this country. 

The opponents need to keep in mind about the facts that 1) America's high-tech industries need these people more than ever. The demands are high. Today's world is all about the competition top human resource. 2) It is not these people who are taking jobs aways. The problem is the way larger number of illegal immigrants, who have limited education background and skills. 

After all, the OPT STEM extension provides the opportunity for people like me to stay in this country, work hard and prove ourselves. It would be a disaster if the America even refuses to give us the opportunity.
