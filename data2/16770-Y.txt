I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, many famous man was an international student in the U.S..

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many international students have a high salary and their jobs does not fit the residents. Competition can help the U.S. find more talents and increase the average salary of all the people, including the local students and the international students.
