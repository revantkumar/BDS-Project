Hi There, 

Thanks a ton for such great changes and great work in the OPT extension Improvisation.

I am a STEM student on 17 month OPT extension.
As per the heading under 48, I see that, students who are in 17 month OPT can apply for 7 month extension period. But it also says that, one must apply 120 days prior his 17 month OPT expires. My opt will expire on Feb 2nd, I wouldn't be eligible for another extension(Because I don't have 120 days period). It would be really a big help if we are also given an opportunity to apply for 7 more months which gives us an edge to test our luck for H1 again in Apri 2016. There are many people who arent luck enough like me where H1 is not picked in the lottery, and are working so hard to be in the legal status. 

In this case, we have to choose a college, which offers day 1 CPT, which might not be near my work place, have to travel at least twice a month, do assignments, projects and also work in the office every day. 

If we are given an opportunity, it would really, really make OUR LIVES happier, we will apply for H1 again in 2016 April.. It would really be of great help to a few hundreds over here who are thousands of miles away from their homes.. 

Writing this on behalf of many of my friends who wish the same thing to happen.
