Michael Sgarioto To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Michael P. Sgarioto. I am a recent graduate from the Milwaukee School of Engineering with one of the first
degrees in BioMolecular Engineering struggling to get the experience I need for the career I have chosen myself. 

This legislation will only further hurt my chances of obtaining the necessary experience to develop a successful and bright
career. You are effectively shrinking the pool of American STEM graduates by letting foreign STEM graduates to take these
opportunities. This legislation will hurt a generation of scientists, engineers, and technologists and will leave a lasting scar
that will haunt future STEM graduates with regret for their pursuit in a STEM career.

The effects of this legislation will not only be felt by current and future STEM graduates, but will only add to our growing 
problems as a country. By employing foreign STEM graduates, the unemployment rate will only continue to rise and 
participating companies will benefit for their actions. This legislation will only be another road block in the way of our progress
as a nation. 

This also corners foreign workers by forcing them to work with one employer, and not giving them the ability to unionize. 
Essentially, you are limiting their ability to be workers and forcing them to be slaves. This is cruel and disgusting actions.
These STEM graduates should be given the opportunity to work wherever they want, with whomever they choose, and should
not be criticized for having a voice.

Since graduating, I have learn many truths while working in the STEM field, but I would never think that my own country would
stand in the way of my career and dreams. I do not know this America. Please do not allow this legislation to pass. Give us
back the America where our dreams can be made a reality and freedom for all is a God given inalienable right. 

Thank you.
