I DO SUPPORT the OPT-extention.

1. International students are outstanding. Those who are admitted by the universities in america are among the best student in the world. Their abilities have been proved by the admission, and become even better with study here. I do not see the point to let them return but not work for america. They are precious resourse, they are fortune, not someone that should be drive away from this country. That is Silly!

2. Saying international students have responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry is rediculous. Do you know how much it cost to persue a BCs degree for an international student? More than 100,000 dollars! Do you think a cheap labor will spend such amount of money ahead, then earn a small salary? To the contrary, they are diligent, smart, and ambitions, which is the main power to drive a company develop.

3. As an international student, I can tell you actually most of us want to go back to hometown at last, but we also do not want to leave without working experience. With the 24-month extension, ok, we will probably work in a desired position without asking h1b for 2 years, then just go back. But if without the extension, under the pressure of leaving, we may accept the jobs that gives low salary. THAT's how the salary level may be reduced.

For those reasons, I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extention.
