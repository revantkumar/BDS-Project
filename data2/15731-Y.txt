I support OPT extension program. I actually am working with several international students in the team. They are talent and hard working. I also served as hiring manager several times. I think international students, especially from STEM majors, did show a lot of potential to contribute to the company. And with a longer period, it also gives the company time to turn them from a new graduate to someone with experience which can better serve the company.
