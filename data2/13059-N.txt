We have to many highly educated Americans, college degrees, that cannot find employment, due to too many HB1 VISAs. They are doing entry level at fast food, instead of using their degree in their field. They cannot pay back their student loans and many are still living in their parents homes. Do not expand the program, to allow more foreign workers into our Country, until ALL Citizens who can work are.
