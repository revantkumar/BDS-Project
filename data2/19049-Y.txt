I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Under the globalization environment, the United State as the most opening country in the world need more and more international students for developing. They can come up with the new developmental points from different direction due to the different culture. 
3. We should focus on if the individual can help develop the United States but refusing all international students.We need the person who own ability!
