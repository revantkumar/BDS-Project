I strongly Support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. We should take the benefits from those international students who were educated from the United States. We used at least 4 to 5 years to train them, we must use them to make contribution to our country. 1 years opt is too short. It is reasonable for a person to use one year to get used to his/her new job, and gradually make contributions. The latter years are those years who could make more contributions.

2.It will help US to keep the No.1 position in the economics and science. International students who trained in US are usually the best ones in their own country, and they can help US solve a lot of problems and improve science and economics. Yes, competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. In this case, our people will work hard and also create more properties. If there is no competition, maybe our people will just stay at home and choose not to got to work. Moreover, this regulation is also beneficial to diversity and collaboration, therefore resulting in surprising successes. With those international students, our country will move much much faster in the field of economics and science.
