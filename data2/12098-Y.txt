All these rules changes are great but why would you let these desi consultancies to operate in the US. They basically fake resumes and push fresh graduates into experienced roles and ruin the entire systems. Most of these companies make big money and it's all done illegally!! I'm appalled that the US government is showing a blind eye towards this. It's not hard to identify these companies either. Just Google desi consultancy and you will get over 4000 fake companies that operate on this fake resume basis. Kindly put a stop to this first then talk about immigration policies.
Thank you
