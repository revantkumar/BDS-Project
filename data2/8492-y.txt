Kunal Jain Please improve and expand the F1 Training Opportunities for International students as the students who work in the STEM fields are skillful, hardworking and intelligent from which US companies will be benefited. 

In addition, International students pay a lot more tuition fee than the regular students. Giving opportunity to them for working will encourage them and make their US experience beneficial.
