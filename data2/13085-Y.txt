PLEASE RESCEND the "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students" Proposed Rule. As a former Information Technology professional, I can attest that finding suitable employment in the IT industry is extremely difficult at best. There are millions of IT professionals who still can't find full time jobs and adding to the competition pool the potentially millions of immigrants will only compound the problem and lower the income potential of those professionals. No immigrant, legal or illegal should have job preference over hard-working tax-paying citizens.
