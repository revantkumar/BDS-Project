I support this rule for several reasons below:

First of all, most of the international students in majors of STEM are in the high IQ club. They have showed their talent and stood out on a worldwide platform after they came to the United States for further study. After the strenuously study and numerous competition, these students with outstanding ability were chosen by the companies. In my view, they are elites who are one in a million.

Secondly, it is a globalized age now, more and more scientific and technical corporations are looking for multilingual and multicultural skilled staff from all over the world. There are many opportunities for both native Americans and international students. For international students, they need a fair competitive environment to get jobs.

Last but not least, international student in majors of STEM accounted for a very small part of the total population here in the United States, it will not lead to a rapid population growth. These talented and skilled students are seeking to contribute their experience, skills and passion to get a start in the United States, they need the chance.
