Jin Liu I am in favor of this proposal since it not only give more opportunities to international students but also to American economy.

As for international students, they have payed a lot of tuition to pursue a better education. What they want more is also the opportunity to put their knowledge into practice, in order to gain more practical experiences. Extension of OPT will surely give more hope to not only current but also prospective international students.

As for American, the OPT extension will not reduce the job opportunities for US citizens, instead, it will promote the economy of American. Because the students with OPT are actually high-level employees, which can hardly been replaced by local citizens. Without this group of high-level talents, many companies will face big development challenge, which will ultimately effect the economy negatively and cause more unemployment for US citizens.
