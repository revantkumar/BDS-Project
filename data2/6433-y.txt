Andrew Toussaint I strongly support this new rule. International students not only brought tuition into US but also improved the development of high tech. Most of STEM students work for high-tech companies and to maintain their status they work harder than domestic residents. To be honest, international students are much harder to find jobs in US compared to US citizens. People who stayed in US and worked in US are highly qualified and motivated. US need those outstanding people to maintain its development.
