The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned, but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. 

This DHS proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.

As Senator Grassley stated in a letter to President Obama; "By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent." 

This DHS proposed rule is simply another attempt to use a regulation to circumvent the immigration laws enacted by Congress. The citizens of the U.S. deserve better. Our economy does not need yet another source of cheap labor for the left to exploit as a means of expanding immigration numbers.

This proposed rule needs to sent to the dumpster. It runs counter to sound fiscal policy and it is a slap in the face of the American worker.
