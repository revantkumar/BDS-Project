Tim Huang I am working in an Agricultural company as a statistical consultant. Most of the statisticians in my group are international employees. This phenomenon is shown in the whole statistical field, as well as the entire STEM fields. America needs foreign talents in STEM subject as horsepowers of the industry. Extensions on OPT period will doubtlessly attract more intelligence to US.
