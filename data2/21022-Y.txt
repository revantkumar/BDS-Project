I strongly support the new expansion of OPT. I am applying for graduate school in the united states right now and I can imagine how this expansion will greatly encourage my motivation to contribute my effort to this amazing country because of greater possibility of earning a job according to my skills. In addition, I know the story of my brother who is already at his fifth year of Ph.D. degree in Economy, University of Chicago. He has already married a wonderful lady in United States and was planning to work and stay longer here thanks to the previous 17-month expansion. Now he is much more optimistic and feels more motivated thanks to the potential 24-month expansion. The approval of this proposal will definitely encourage the international students studying in United States, thus directly increase the income of local American residents who owns stores or restaurants. High-tech company will be easier and more convenient to enroll in talented international stem students to make contributions to the well-being of the United States.
