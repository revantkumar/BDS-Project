I am totally disgusted and in disbelief that there could even be such a proposal when hundreds of thousands of U S citizens are unemployed and underemployed. Rule making changes should work laboriously to find ways to get our citizens employed rather than making new rules to keep them unemployed and underemployed.

Please publish the detailed cost/benefit analyses that show why the people of the United States benefit from the proposed rule which benefits a companies and their shareholders rather than benefiting the people as a whole.
