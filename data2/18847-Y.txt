I support OPT new extension rules. 

My little son working as an engineer in an American companies. He's working very diligently and contributing much time to his work every day, and even has less time communicating with family online. I know a group of his friends, like him graduate from top universities in USA, received high GPA and all great honors from school and professors. They do work hard. They have to be much harder than local students to compete with them. And they are strong. Employers prefer hard working people for sure. 

Although he spent more time on work than family, I highly support him to do what he likes.
