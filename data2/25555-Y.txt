I strongly support the proposed changes in the OPT for the following reasons:

1. They give equal opportunities for talented and skilled F1-students to get practice in US companies and to apply what they learned in US universities. F1-students do not take the jobs from US-citizens since they all compete on equal terms.

2. F1-students and postdocs contribute a significant part to US Science and Technology. Denying this OPT extension would mean that the potential job positions will be occupied by less skilled employees, both citizens and non-citizens. This is eventually resulting to a negative impact on US Economy.

3. I also welcome improvements in regulations over OPT extensions in order to ensure that students gain valuable practical STEM experience.
