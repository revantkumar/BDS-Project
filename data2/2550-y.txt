Anonymous I strongly support this move from the fact that it supports US economy by getting top 10% students globally. Bright minds yet enthusiastic and motivated come to US, get high-end training and work hard and contribute towards US economy. Therefore, students who come to US for study, workers at companies & international entrepreneurs contribute towards US economy at every step since entry to US from fees, tourism,taxes to creating jobs. We have many examples,many new start-ups launched by these international students that in turn hire American, international workers and pay high end taxes, thereby, contributing towards US economy. So in the end , its not just foreign workers/students benefit, it do benefits Americans. 

US as a country had always remained fair towards competition. That's why, its called land of opportunities.

I respect and support this move.
