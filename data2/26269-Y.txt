I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I am a computational finance master student from China. Prior to coming to the US, I had several options to pursue my master degree but eventually chose to come to the US because of this STEM rule. I think the STEM rule offers students like me a great opportunity not only to get several years market exposure before returning to their countries but also to actually learn from the most developed financial system in the world after the graduation. Also, to the industry practitioners of the US, doing business or co-working with international elites give an opportunity to collaborate ideas and make friends. In my opinion, what I just mentioned above made the US the most attractive country for study abroad.
