Tom Hamilton What gives the federal government the right promote discrimination against its citizens and steal their labor "for the good of the nation"?

Back in 2007 I was forced, through workplace harassment, to resign a position I had for over 10 years so a recent foreign graduate could remain in the U.S. The work was not STEM at all. It was web development for an insurance company's marketing division.

I'm called a myth by politicians like Schumer who doesn't represent me and denigrates me as a "privileged elite" not deserving of any rights.

I'd like an explanation why I shouldn't view the federal government as a terrorist group pursuing their own throat-cutting agenda. It certainly took more from me than any ISIS member I'm supposed to view as the enemy ever did.
