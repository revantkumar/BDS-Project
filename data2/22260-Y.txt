I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. They are well educated and can make more contributions to the U.S.
2. Diversity is important for the U.S as many international students who stay in the U.S obtain huge achievement.
3 Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. This can increase the whole level of the U.S and some positions are hard for the local but are fit for the international students.
