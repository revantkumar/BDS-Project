Good opportunity for all citizens actually. More communication and cooperation create opportunity for technology exchange and improvement. High quality of education and high-tech industry are the core soul of United States. We cannot lose it. Consider how important Silicon Valley affects the economy of US. This policy is nothing to do with the immigration, it attracts excellent F-1 Nonimmigrant students to join US education system and communicate with local students. I don't think it has negative influence on local engineers. It helps them to improve the skill and open their eyes in a diverse environment, becoming more professional together with international students. Cooperation is the key to success.
