Dennis Foltz I have serious concerns about Homeland Security's plans to expand the training opportunities rules for foriegn students. It is one thing to allow them to take part time work to help cover expenses while they learn here. It is blatantly wrong to allow them to stay here and compete with American citizens for jobs in their field of training. Every job available should first be offered to a legal U.S. Citizen. Only if no U.S. Citizen can be found to fill the job should a non-citizen be able to apply. We can not continue to throw Americans under the bus for the sake of corporate profits.
