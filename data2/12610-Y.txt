I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons.
The student who graduates from this country should have opportunity to contribute this country. There are huge amount of shortage of STEM background workers, that is why the salary of the positions related to STEM is raising so quickly in these few years. Furthermore, This proposal will not hurt the job of US citizen, since STEM students will not allow to be employed by a related position, combining with the shortage of STEM workers in US, normal US citizen will not loss they job.
