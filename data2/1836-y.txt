John Thomas, Intel Strongly agree.
I have several strong international opt employers in my group. Without this rule, they may be forced to leave. My team even has problem to survive. I believe this is also the case in many other engineering companies, especially in information technology industry.
The worry of taking away citizens' positions make zero senses since we have very insufficient engineering colleges graduates who are citizens very year. Our local born students are more interested in being lawyers, doctors or merchants.
Considering the prosperity of us and the survival of many companies, do approve it ASAP !
