I strongly support the proposed rule. After doing some research, I find that there are approximately 100k F-1 students are in 12-month OPT programs, and 30k in 29-month OPT programs. Rejecting the rule would have really bad influence to American STEM industry!

First, 12-month are not enough to complete an project for most of time. If there is no extension, those companies would lose 30k talents, and need to spend money and human resources to hire new people. I believe that would be a really expensive costs for a company.

Second, with 17-month extension for previous year, STEM industry has a balance of number of workers. Without the extension, companies would suddenly break the balance of employees, which might cause chaos and badly influence the development of industry.

Third, U.S. is famous for its diversity, and I think that is the key why U.S. become such advanced in STEM area. With the extension, American universities could attract foreign students by OPT, and meanwhile American companies could benefit from hiring highly-educated students from the world.

In short, I have reasons to believe that OPT extension would bring more benefits to U.S. than without it.
