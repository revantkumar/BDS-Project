Paul Jost I support this rule. My wife and I own over 100 units of apartments next to a university. Over half of my tenants are foreign students. Almost all of those students are perfect tenants. They pay rent in time, never make troubles around. Since the previous OPT extension rules came out, the university expand their science and engineering department to attract additional foreign students to boost up their reputation in those areas. As a result, my apartments has been becoming hotter every year. The average rent increases by over 100% over the past several years and I never worry about finding tenants. I also believe a lot of local business besides mine got better thanks to our general policy to attract those talents all over the world. Please let this rule pass!
