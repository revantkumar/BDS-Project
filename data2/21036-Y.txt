I totally support this rule for following reasons:
1 Everyone create equal. American spirit gives everyone equal chance to study and work. Talented students deserve more time to practice skills after graduation.
2 Good for US since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US. Not only for education, also for local economy.
