I am happy for this rule. F-1 students will get a chance at OPT and showcasing their abilities. They will get multiple chances to get through the H1B lottery system. American Corporations can benefit by employing the US college educated students directly. If employed directly by the American Corporations, the students will be starting out their lives and will be investing in the US. It is a win-win platform for the students (livelihood in the US), American Corporations (current and diverse skills brought in by students, experienced workers choosing the best from the diverse skill set brought in, business modernization and growth, economic growth) and the US government (skilled labor, economic growth) .
