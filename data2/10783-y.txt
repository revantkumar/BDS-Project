Elliot Moss Please remember who you work for - the American people. Not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. This is just wrong. Why does the American tax payer have to foot the bill for foreigners to utilize our infrastructure. A 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors. Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.

Stand up for Americans not foreigners.
