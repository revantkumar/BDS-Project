A D I strongly support the extension. Here are my reasons for the support:

- Unites Stated is currently facing STEM workforce shortage. 

- Unemployment among the STEM graduates (undergraduate level) is lower in the US, however, most US-students take up jobs in marketing, sales etc. This represents inclination of American workers towards non-engineering/ non-science jobs. Meanwhile, most F-1 students come for Science and Engineering degrees. Note that these are advanced degrees MS, Ph.D. International students have shown more inclination towards pursuing these degrees in Science and Engineering.
This shows that they are more interested in getting jobs in the STEM Areas. Therefore, it is not the cheap labor that allows international students to get STEM jobs, but genuine interest and eligibility (due to advanced degrees).

- If at all American-STEM-job problem exists, it will not be solved by blocking the international students from getting those jobs. It will simply hurt the companies that rely on eligible candidates. Eventually, they may end up outsourcing those jobs across the world.

- US economy is built on fair competition. This extension gives a fair chance to students to work hard, compete, find a job, and better their lives. They have proven to be not only good employees but also have helped in establishing many tech companies which have only led to the creation of more jobs. The US needs to allow this to continue.
