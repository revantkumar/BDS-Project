I strongly support OPT and extension for STEM F-1 students.

Being a an international PhD students studying at a public US institution for 5 years and with 1 year US industry experience, I conduct academic research and publish my findings. OPT and its extension has enabled qualified (backed by US employer) international students continuing their cutting-edge research and deliver products of great impact.

Truths:

- STEM foreign students cannot "steal" jobs: the extension has be to supported by the US employer clearly stating that such employment cannot be filled by domestic candidates. The F-1 applicants for OPT extension are strong candidates who went through some of the most selective technical hiring process.

- Foreign students "simply contribute", and such extension will allow them to continue. They contribute in research labs, university, technical institutions, not even mentioning the technology industry. Of 20 PhD students adopted the same year with me, 12 are international. Many of them have great publication record, and many continued teaching and researching in prestigious institutions.

- FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) syndrome: all I've see through the comments are "illegals", "you fools", "disgusting", "not foreigners!!!", "Obama out of his mind". What are you trying to sell? Let's put everything under reason, and these are not reasoning to me.
