I greatly favor extending the STEM OPT to 24 months. I have a PhD in applied physics from a large US university, and currently conduct research at that university in the fields of genomics. In my experience, foreign individuals with training in the US in STEM fields provide valuable service and expertise to our communities, while contributing to growth and innovation. Our immigration system should encourage these individuals to make valuable contributions to the US, by making it easier for them to work in our country after they graduate.
