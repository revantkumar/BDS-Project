I don't know how to make an exaggerated comment. My classmates from Asian countries, such as India, Iran, China, Korea, etc, all expect the 24-Month OPT will be continued and even extended in the future. These F1 students believe that US not only provides a fair and effective working environment but also a free and safe political environment. They leave their family with education loans on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, holding the American Dream. Let this dream part of their life and bring prosperity to US.

Thanks.
