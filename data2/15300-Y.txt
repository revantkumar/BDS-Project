I don't think those high tech companies hire foreign students because they are low labor. Those people who argue for foreign students make them lose job should think about themselves and find a way to improve their skills and education. Before a U.S. company hire foreign labor, they already public a document to prove that there is no appropriate local worker for this position. That is enough
