Simon Liu I support the extension of training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students for following reasons:
1) Most prestigious universities and research institutions in United States attract students all over the world by their outstanding academic curriculums and unique opportunities to work with most advanced techniques and talented workmates. If international students do not have the chance to work in US after finishing their studies, they will be less interested in attending schools in United States and may pursue their academic degrees in other countries such as United Kingdom and Canada which also have great academic programs. If America can no longer attract most talented students, it will be hard to maintain its position as leader in technology revolution.
2) The absolute majority of international students will go back to their countries eventually as statistics shown from the past. It will be a great opportunity if international students can get chances to work in US for a while before they go back home, since it will help them to gain more experience. 
3) Across universities in the country, we all learn that having equal opportunities for everyone is a core part of American culture, and hence international students should also have equal opportunities to work in United States when they are qualified for a job.
