An eviction of American educated foreign scientists, engineers, and mathematicians would create a brain drain that seems counter-intuitive in the pursuit of maintaining American global leadership in technology and sciences. Industry professionals and graduate students who have honed in on their areas of expertise would be forced to take their knowledge that they have developed during their time here back to their respective country of origins. It would be highly advantageous to retain qualified and productive members of society that contribute to a healthy economy and work in fields that create new job opportunities for our American counterparts.
