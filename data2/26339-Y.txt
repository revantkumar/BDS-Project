I'm a senior student who studying at PennState with Information Science and Technology major. When I learned about the government is going to cancel STEM extension, I became really curious about if the governor do understand the real situation of the U.S?

1 Top5% of my classmate was hired by Google, Facebook as a programmer. They are well-educated, energetic, sharp international students. If they can't get STEM extension but go back to their home countries. That's going to be a lost of talent for US.

2 A lot of companies right now emphasis on global acumen. That's the main reason to sponsor international student and invest a lot on the sharp young just graduated college kids. To allow them bring fresh blood and global sense to organization. Why would U.S cut off the pipe of energy builded by young ppl but to let rigid and narrow mind be full of the large corp's working environment.???
