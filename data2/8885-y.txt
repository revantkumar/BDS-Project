Han Gen I largely support this new rule as a future international student at US university. The 24 months(36 in the new rule) opt is the most attractive fact for me to apply for the US colleges and universities over other international educational programs. And I think many of the STEM students just want to gain professional or research experience after graduation and then go back to their home countries. This will definitely not take up most of the job opportunities for US citizens.
