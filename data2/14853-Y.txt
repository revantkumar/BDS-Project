I abdolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. 
Everybody understands how important STEM is for our country, we need to encourage more brilliant international students, as well as future generations of students all over the world, to work and contribute in science and technology of U.S.. This new proposal definitely will bring more benefits than threats to the future of America.
