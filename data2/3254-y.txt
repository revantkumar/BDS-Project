Will Samueal I strongly support the extension of OPT. Because what I think matter the most is whether a rule can benefit the country in a long way. First of all, America is a immigration country from the beginning, so, those who are worrying about more immigrants should think about where they came from. Second of all, this rule can help keeping the smart ones in the states, and they are those who build thing and create value, and they are educated by our university. They isn't any asset more valueable than them.
