John Smith It seems like there are already enough reasons to support the extension of STEM OPT programs, so I am writing mainly to address those who oppose the extension.The biggest misconception that they have is the extension of STEM OPT causes unemployment of US citizens. However, it simply does not. 886,052 international students studied in the US in 2013/2014 (966,333 in July 2014), and only 12% of them are opt (include STEM and regular opt). In the meantime, according to US. Department of Labor, 48848000 citizens who are over age of 25 and own a Bachelor's degree and higher are in employment in 2014. In other words, STEM opt students are only taking less than 0.2% of job opportunities for people who have a Bachelor's degree and higher. If those 1600000 unemployed college students in the year of 2014 are placing the blame on those 0.2% rather than their own incompetence and illegal immigration, the logic behind their blame is clearly absurd.
