Shiqi Gan Canceling the OPT extension would be unfair.
I am from a family that is not rich, so pursuing my master degree in the US was not an easy decision to make. I was offered another opportunity to study in Waseda University, Japan, but I finally came here. One of the reason is because of your more friendly post graduation training opportunity.
Now I have started my job as a structural engineer in NYC for 3 month. As a beginner, most of the work assigned to me was doing calculation and modeling under seniors and associates' supervise. So strictly speaking, I am not a real engineer yet, for in general concept, the main job of an engineer should designing instead of just doing calculation and running software. The OPT is an extension of the education, so I am expecting it to give me experience beyond the things I kept doing in school (doing calculation and running software), and this cannot happen until the moment I grow to a senior engineer, which usually does not happen after one year or two years, but three years. It usually take about three years for a structural engineer to have enough experience, knowledge and confidence to be promoted to a senior. That is why I think the OPT should be able to be extended for two years.
