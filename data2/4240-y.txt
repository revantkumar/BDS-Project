Yi Ye I support Improving and Expanding STEM program because it benefits the States' economy and technology growth. Years after years international students under STEM curriculum have been studying and training in United States and contributing their knowledge and skills to the nation's leading position of science and technology over other country's. The training period is critical for STEM students to make use of what they learned in school. However, the short time period limits their options and many of them are forced to leave the States to seek opportunity in other countries, which contradicts United States' interest in educating and absorbing talented professional globally.

The giant economic benefits from international students, especially from STEM, shouldn't be ignored either. NAFSA report stated that from 2013 to 2014 alone, international students contributed $26.8 billion and 340K jobs for the States. It will be giant step backward if USA doesn't improve or expand the opportunities for this large number of people who believe in the US education and technology advantage. Considering this turmoil of time of the world, the States should acquire this big pool of talents to gain more edge in global affair.
