As an American parent of college students, I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would incentivize employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. Having seen recent college graduates struggling to find work and local tech companies laying off thousands of employees this summer, I believe that immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against them.
