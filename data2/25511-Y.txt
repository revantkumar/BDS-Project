As a international student, I support this proposal to help myself and many students like me. As a future scientist, I work hard to make a better career and to expand human knowledge in the medical research field, which would benefit patients who suffer from diseases. However, relatively short OPT period makes it difficult for many excellent student to stay in US and perform outstanding work without worrying about their legal status. This new OPT extension proposal would benefit lots of students and keep United State stay on the top of STEM area in the world.
