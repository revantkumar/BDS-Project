In my opinion, this will be a great news for both America employer and their international employees. 

International students will be able to get more training opportunities after they are done with school. And their knowledge and skills gained from the training can definitely benefit their employer. Meanwhile, international employees will be more confident to contribute to their own country after educated and trained in US. Also, this extension will be a great attraction to international students and they will be more willing to come to US compared with other countries. Therefore, US can attract more excellent people all over the world to contribute to it.
