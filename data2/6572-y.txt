Kania Kristy I am working in a small start-up based in Chicago. We were founded in 2005, and is about to reach its tenth year. The device provided platform service to train the surgeons for performing complex procedures based on computer simulation that could replace and save traditional training instrumentation,Among the group of ten, only two are Americans, and others are from Argentina, India and China, who have been constantly contributed the entire intellectural property. The projects are previously funded by NIH, but with all the efforts we achieve, our petition finally draws attention from external investor seeking for collaboration, which means it could spread the influence in a massive scale, and the outstanding research outcome can be put into practical use. Without the efforts of the international employees relying on OPT extension, we could never possibly fulfill the goal in submitted proposal in the promised deadline. I am not sure how many small businesses are out there sailing the same boat like us, but our fate is your call!
