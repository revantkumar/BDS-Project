I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. US government have investigated huge amounts of money for supporting researches in universities EVERY single year.
Most of graduate students who use those fundings are from other countries, especially Ph.Ds. They have learnt a lot through their studies and researches which are based on funding from US gov. 
It is important to give these students chances to stay in this country and contribute to this country instead of kicking them out which is an EXTREMELY shortsighted thought.

2. Without talent immigrants, these tech giants such as Google, Facebook would not grow so fast and become the most influent companies in the world. In addition, those companies rely on the skills and knowledge of these immigrants to keep growing. 
For those people who are against this proposal and believe immigrants toke the job opportunities, go home and ask yourself a question "Do you qualify those job positions?".
