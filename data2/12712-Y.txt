Good approach by DHS to expand the OPT extension for STEM students which will allow students to work for 3 years in their field even if they dont get selected in H1 B lottery. Otherwise it would have been unfair to the international STEM students who invest so much in tuition fees at US universities only to return back home with huge debt and without work experience.
I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also important to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness.
The Next step I feel DHS should take is increasing the H1B cap for advanced degrees (masters) in USA which is currently 20000.
