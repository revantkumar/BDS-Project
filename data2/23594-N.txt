I strongly oppose the ICEB Proposed Rule. Read your American history. When the country had high unemployment of our
citizens we stopped immigration so Americans could get employment. I do not understand the thinking of our government 
officials from top to bottom. This is the reason candidates running for a chance to be our President in the next election are 
not former government pros. Wake up America before it is too late!!
