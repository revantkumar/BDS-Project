Weiyi Peng I strongly SUPPORT this rule for the following reasons:
America is one of the greatest, strongest country in the world, the world sees America a country like that is not only because our economic power and military power, but also the spirit of American. In this country, people has equal chance, people has the maximum rights to live their life and follow their life path. What makes this country the greatest country in the world is because the America spirit effects the people who born in this country, the people who come to this country and even the people who knows about this country. The students who come to study in this country deserves more time and a chance to contribute their knowledge and power for this country.
If you really know well about OPT STEM and the current job market, you should understand OPT doesnt give the same amount of opportunities to these students compare to the CITIZEN or GREEN CARD HOLDER. These students only can find job which is related to their major and because they only can work in US with certain amount of time or other reasons, many companies are not willing to hire them. So most part of these students have to or chose to go back their country after they graduate. But after all, it is a good thing for US economy to have skilled, talented foreign people working in IT area.
