Alexandra Peake By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 50% - from US$4.4 trillion in 2012 to US$6.2 trillion. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity. This suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
