Linjie Han, AbbVie I strongly support the United States to extend the OPT period by 24 months (STEM OPT extension). My reasons are as follows.

Firstly, employees with STEM majors can make great contributions to US economy, in the fields of IT, energy, medicine, and so on. Like my colleagues and I, we are working in pharmaceutical company as the senior scientist to develop better methods to provide consistently high-quality drugs to US patients. I believe the longer the time we are allowed to work in US, the more benefit we can bring to USA.

Secondly, I don't think the high unemployment rate is closely related to the existence of international people with STEM majors. Most of them are holding PhD degrees which need very high demand of professional knowledge and capabilities. They are doing the work which has very high barrier for others to be involved in. 

Thirdly, the 24 months extension will be a highly appealing selling-point for people who want to study abroad. Knowing that US may provide them with a chance to work for 3 years after graduation, they will pick USA as their first option for pursuing their PhD. This will bring more intelligent and smart people to USA, and also booster up the economy.

Overall, I would be very happy to see 24 months STEM OPT extension get approval. This will be beneficial not only to the OPT students, but also to the US economy in the long run.
