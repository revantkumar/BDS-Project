Chenfei Lin I believe STEM OPT extension is a good thing to US. High tech is one of US's core advantages. Among the people who contributes to the development of High tech, STEM OPT students are definitely important ones. The booming of High tech helps the economy of US and contributes to the reduction of unemployment rate. From what I see, Austin, TX is expanding because of High tech industry. All the restaurants and shops are hiring. Those jobs are created because of High tech and STEM OPT while at the same time those jobs are not for STEM OPT students. On the other side, most of the high tech jobs are not suitable for unemployed US citizens. In other word, STEM OPT is not taking away jobs but creating more for americans. Why oppose it?
