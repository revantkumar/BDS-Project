Shenyao Ke I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. OPT and STEM extension has become an important reason for excellent international student to choose US university rather than European schools. A lot of students in STEM disciplines have been working in research, engineering, medical and other areas for the country, which benefits every US citizen in different ways. It is not obvious to most people. But think about what if some international students working on a medical research for years but cannot keep working on it all of a sudden. It will not only be a huge loss for the company, the research organization, and the government, but also affect every American citizen.

2. OPT STEM extension will not lower the wage for full-time job for American citizens. OPT is for internship! It is normal to pay lower for internship than full-time job all over the world. However, once it turns into full-time job, it makes no difference between international students and American citizens.

3. A lot of companies have nothing to do with OPT extension since they are not e-verified. I noticed that many people mentioned they get lower paid in companies like Disney because of students with opt extension. However, neither Disney animation studio nor disneyland is e-verified! To get the extension, a student has to be in STEM degree and the company he/she works for has to be e-verified at the same time. I'm pretty sure not many US citizens realize it.

I am international student but I have lots of American friends. They are nice and we help each other in study and in daily life. I'm sure most US citizens are willing to accept excellent international student to study and work in US. And in return, we will benefit the US and its citizens with our knowledge and hard work. I strongly believe this proposal should pass.
