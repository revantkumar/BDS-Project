Having international students working for US employers is absolutely good. Be sure that we are saying STEM students who are smart and talented to contributes technology and improve people's daily life.
International students shares different culture backgrounds, which are extremely important for technology development. We design products or technology for people in a specific culture, having them work at us, can help us understand more about different types of products and make more profits. 
Education is a industry, we of course should offer competitive policy to attract international students to come to our country to further their study. Again, we are not talking about all students, we are talk about STEM students. 
I would say, welcome!
