Nitish Dixit I fully support the rule of extending the OPT extension from 17 to 24 months for the following reasons:
> This'll allow the foreign students who have been studying so much away from their home, to get more hands on experience in their respective field and learn more.
> It'll also help the US economy a lot too as all those students will be paying taxes.
> It'll help the companies to develop/innovate more as they'll have more workers specializing in the field that they are looking for, and they'll be able to find them quickly.
> It'll boost the morale of the students who are currently doing their masters etc, as they'll have some peace of mind knowing that they'll be able to apply what they've learnt, in the real world where projects might take 2-3 years to complete sometimes. 
> It'll attract more international students in US and contribute to their and US' growth.

That being said there is a part in the rule that I don't like that much, and that's mentor and training program. I would agree that the main goal of someone on an OPT extension is to learn but keeping a check in such a way that it puts more pressure on the employer and the DSO is not correct. In the M & training program the employer and employee will have to report as to what the employee is upto(learning) and then DSO would have to approve of it, this'll put unnecessary paperwork and workload on both of them. I think if a person is working at any company he/she will definitely be learning, else why would he/she be there or more importantly why will the company keep him/her. 
So, I think T&M program is kind of overdoing it.

Other than that I think it is a great rule which is going to benefit everyone and I absolutely approve of it.
