Abhinav Singhal For the betterment and growth of a country the key ingredient is the willingness of it people to work hard and smart. This requires broad exposure and understanding of people from various walks of life and background.

To keep a healthy growth curve we require people to come and support this great nation in its endeavor towards success.

For this, what is required is a motivating factor and surety that we can look forward to a prosperous and friendly life, free from any mental stress about limited time visas and indefinite and elaborate paper work.

I thus request for the Extension for STEM students to stay in effect so that we can attract more talented mind to the US.
