The American Worker -- the next Endangered Species! Jobs are being exported to third world countries. Those that can't are now being filled by imported foreign workers. I'm grateful that I will never have a grandchild to grow up as an "Underclass Citizen of the World". Disgraceful! Our founding fathers, who gave all to establish this country, must be rolling in their graves. Thanks Congress!
