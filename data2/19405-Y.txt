Dear DHS,

I strongly support the proposal and I think it benefits United States in the following aspects:

1) United States as a great country needs highly skilled / well educated people to keep the edge in Technology, in Science in Mathematics. OPT STEM program not only attracts excellent students from all over the world to come to study in USA but also keeps outstanding scholars to stay and contribute to this country. It is without a question that without STEM, many those talent will flow to other countries and one day, USA may loose its advantages.

2) STEM does bring some competition in the Job market. However, the competition exists most in the highly skilled research fields such as computer science, data analysis, biological technology and astronomy. Many international scholars who made break through in different research fields have more or less benefited from or being encouraged from STEM program, which shows that USA values such talents. The arguments that STEM program increases competition in Job market does not stand the spirit that USA people have and an end of such program would bring very bad influence to such a great nation.

In sum, I believed such proposal could strongly benefit United States. The advanced technology could bring us a better economy in a near future.
