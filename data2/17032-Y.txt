I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. It is fair for university students to work in the U.S. industry to practice their working skills. Therefore, what they have learn`t in the universities seems more reliable.
2. International students are making great contributions in the U.S. industry. 
3. Competition is not so bad, It will make people going further. 
4. What`s more, fields of industry international students take part in are just U.S. lacks. Therefore, companies wish to hire international students.
