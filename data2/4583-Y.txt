I support the Proposed Rule "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students".
The proposed new regulation will effectively attract the worlds best students, which is one of the most important factors of retaining the position of USA as the global leader in technology and innovation. The applicable scope of this regulation has been defined for student who are majoring in STEM of accredited schools. This clear presetting was proposed based on the heavy demand of talents for professional positions. From the companies perspective, the STEM OPT extension will allow companies to have a more comprehensive validation of their international employees, making sure that the money will only be spent on qualified employees. The STEM OPT extension will not only be harmless to the general US citizen job market, but also promote the economic growth long-termly.
