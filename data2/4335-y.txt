Feng Wang I Strongly support 24 months OPT extension for foreign STEM students.

Foreign STEM students help create a competitive environment to make American students work harder. Foreign STEM students have lots of disadvantages, like visa, culture, and langues, than local students. But they still get the job. Do those who oppose OPT extension really think about the reason? That's because they are creative, smart, efficient and hard working. Don't say it's because they accept lower rate. Geod companies don't care about small money. Also I myself for example, have a salary of $ 90,000. American can't just lie in the soft bed their ancestor build and hope the government to protect them from any competition. They need to work hard and dare compete with foreigners. At least one generation should bear the pain from foreign STEM students' competition, either you or your son. If all young people want to live a relaxing life, fishing today and watching movies tomorrow, instead of working on something meaningful, this country won't have a long development.

Foreign STEM students help to create jobs and wealth for large popularity. Please don't only think for yourself, there must be people around you who benefit from the STEM students. They may lend their house to STEM students to collect rent. The restaurant in your neighborhood may have lots of STEM students customers. The key person in your friends' company is foreign STEM student. Your cousin get a job in college because the college recruit lots of foreign STEM student so they want to hire another teaching assistant. I admit that some people may lose their job because of foreign STEM students. But those people who oppose the proposal also need to know that more local American benefit from foreign STEM student. Don't be too selfish.
