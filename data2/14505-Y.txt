I think it is about time you (the Government) began to think about the US Citizen. We have rights and you continue to find ways to trample all over them. Why do you want to spend taxpayer dollars to incentivize employers to hire NON-US employees? We are graduating enough STEM students, it's just employers don't want to pay a competitive salary.

This is a BAD IDEA!!

I should rather you spend my dollars to stem the phony importation of "refugees"!!!
