Steve Williams It is important to implement this new rule ASAP. 
Even the U.S government has provided international students with the opt program after their graduation, only a small number of students will be lucky to find a job in the U.S because most companies do not want to hire international students because they fear that they will be forced to leave and it is not worth the money to hire these group of people. However, there are a large number of companies who are willing to hire international students from STEM program because these students are skilled and when interviewing U.S local students who finish their degree from STEM program and with a good gpa, they are easier to find a decent job in this country.
One thing we need to pay attention to is that we need to implement this new plan ASAP and let it be finished before Feb 12th, 2016. We should not influence the students who are currently under the STEM OPT period. It would be unfair to them and it would be hard for their companies to find the right person at the right time. If there is no policy that can save these group of people, it would be a disaster to the companies, to the local business and to the faith that people believe about U.S.
International students who are under the OPT STEM are very talented. They will bring the benefit instead of problems to the U.S. Therefore, I hope our government should help them and help ourselves to implement the new rule quickly. Thanks.
