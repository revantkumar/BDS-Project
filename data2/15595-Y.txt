Our American need the intelligent population to enhance our economic structure and eventually strengthen our country and our life. 

We have put a lot of resources and Tax money to educate those students abroad, now it is time for us to strategically to give them more opportunities to join our efforts to enhance our economy and to build our american dream. 

That will be a failure to let those intelligence go and be part of power engines irrelevant to US.
