The new STEM extension rules are necessary and helpful to the companies and employers in US. It will allow companies to hire a newly graduate student longer time and in that way contribute more to the company. For those companies are hiring the students work in the extension period, cancelling the rule will hurt the company and they will face immediately staff loss. It will harm the economy in the long run. 

It won't affect other american's opportunities to get a job since students in STEM majors are only small parts of all international students. Sure it will make the job market more competitive for candidates, but it's not a bad thing at all. International students still need to work much harder than domestic students to get a job here. If they want to work longer, they should apply for H1 or other working visa. By doing that, employer should approve that no other american is fit for the job. So that won't affect american's opportunity. Most cases here is, employers are not willing to hire an international student even though they are qualified because their working permission is not stable since the OPT is only one year and chances of getting working visa is getting lower. By extending OPT, it gives employer more choices to hire people.
