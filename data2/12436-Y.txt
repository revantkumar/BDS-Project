I SUPPORT the OPT STEM Extension rule. The international student who applies for the OPT STEM extension is one who already worked for a year and proved that he/she is worth the E-verified company to continually training. So OPT STEM Extension is of great help of keeping talented international student and keeping US Economy healthy.
