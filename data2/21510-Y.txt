Firstly, Extension on OPT for F-1 students who's majors are STEM is vital for development of American's science, technology, engineering and mathematics. In order to obtain the most powerful and most advanced role in the whole world, USA should welcome more and more intelligent and hardworking international students with STEM major to contribute to USA, to accelerate the development of USA.

Besides, USA is an immigrate country with a long history of absorbing different cultures from all corners around the world. Extension of STEM F-1 international students will these students stay longer in USA. The longer they stay in USA, the richer and more colorful American culture will be. 

Last but not the least, international students' costs plays a significant part of American economy. If American government cutting off the extension of STEM international students' OPT, side effects will weaken newer international students' hope and determination to study in USA, like these international students will think USA do not really welcome them so that less and less international students will come. The less international students, the less incoming for US government and less vigorous American economy will be. 

In conclusion, extension of STEM F-1 students benefits a lot for US government, US economy and American people.
