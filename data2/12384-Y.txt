I strongly support this STEM extension rule. As an international student of STEM from an American University, the purpose of receiving an education and degree from US is worthless if there will be no time given to prove my mettle in the technological industry for which I have paid my international currency to gain education. Yes I have spent money to increase and contribute to your economy and hence fail to understand why I should not be given a chance to work here? I too pay my taxes here so I'm not an unlawful resident here as most may comment. I also feel that by giving us a chance to work here you are not harming the chances of hiring nationals as with growing intakes the technological demand and growth will be proportional. And isn't the purpose of education and sharing ideas and knowledge the whole idea behind getting a growing economy? You should be privileged and proud that so many talented individuals choose your country as the place to work and invest their resources in. By not supporting this rule you are just shunning away hundreds and thousands of potential great minds. I strongly believe this rule should stay in place.
