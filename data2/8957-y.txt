Alicia James As a citizen of US, I am so proud our country can push forward this courteous rule to help attract technical experts. Besides, this new regulation is brilliant news for US economy. After considerable reading of this rule, I find out International STEM student are potential entrepreneur and innovator. Also, take my Chinese neighbor for example, when he graduated from his school I knew his plan is to volunteer working in US without any financial income, which means his behavior is focused on creating value rather than steal money from we citizens. I know this might not be a very suitable example, but at least the stereotype rooted in our mind is that we citizens are always the managing level of our system which means those newcomers will serve as our employee to help achieving our goal and needs. It would be really great if someone can work hard for me to help make my dream come true. Therefore, please help those STEM students, help those dream chaser, help those people that can make our life better and make contribution to our nation! The STEM regulation will never be in vain.
