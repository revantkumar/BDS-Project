International students may it be from Japan, China, India or any other country, are working here in the USA for the growth of USA. Students pay taxes same as all the US citizens, even when we don't get any SSN benefit. USA's Bay Area, the Silicon Valley is a Death Valley without International students. There is a common say that International students take away American jobs, but the case is there are no Americans who are capable of doing skilled jobs and don't have a match for international students. There are jobs for Americans, where International students are not eligible, these jobs still remain vacant, why so? All big companies have International CEO's, why? The simple answer, there are no Americans to take the jobs. 
The H1B visa CAP GAP is also a significant rule that needs to be passed, as US companies are putting a lot of money training students to learn new stuff for 3 to 4 months, if that person doesn't get H1B, the company goes in loss as has to hire a new guy and train him all over again. Giving H1B visa to F1 students before opening it up for the general public is important, as the F1 students pay for their school which is about 30000 to 50000 dollars, which is going towards research and salaries for the schools, in turn benefiting the USA.
