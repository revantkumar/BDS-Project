President Obama has done very little to increse jobs here in the USA. It does not make good sense to pay extra to give those jobs to foreign workers until something is done to creat these jobs for American citizens. Something could be done in an immigration rehaul bill that wwould also help to straighten out the mess that our immigration laws are now.
