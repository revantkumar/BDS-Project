I support this rule. Both workers and technology industry will benefit from this rule for following reasons:

(i) Technology industry, especially IT industry is fast growing. It is the new power for the economy of USA. Government should propose more rules to support these industries. 

(ii) The real threat for US workers is not OPT students, but illegal workers. STEM students usually have master or phd degrees. Such people is needed in every country. It is definitely a loss of USA if government lets them go.

Thanks
