We do not need to import any more foreign STEM workers. All it does is take jobs away from hard working Americans who have worked hard to get their degrees in these difficult areas. In addition, this is greatly depressing the salaries in these areas. I am a science and math teacher and am out of work. My sister is in the IT field and has repeatedly trained immigrants with these Visas to replace her at job after job. She has gone from a salary of $100,000/year with a $10,000 yearly bonus to just $20,000/yr. with no bonus and is once again training foreigners to take her place. My 2 older sons with degrees in Aerospace Engineering degrees have had trouble finding jobs and have depressed salaries due to foreign workers being willing to work for much less money. It is time our government started looking out for American citizens rather than foreign workers and large corporations that do not want to pay what jobs are worth.
