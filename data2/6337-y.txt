Luke Lee The new STEM extension policy definately benefit U.S. in the long run. I support the 24 months OPT extension policy for international STEM students based on the following two reasons:

First, the 24 month OPT period is essential for international students to seek internship or full-time position in USA. We have to admit the fact that, OPT is now behaving like a bridge for international students to transfer their status from F-1 to H1-B. While all the U.S. companies are struggling to offer every one of their employee with equal opportunities, the 12 month OPT policy does prevent many of them, espcially start-up companies, from hiring non-US students. The reason is simple, it might not be worthwhile to develop employees ability when knowing they would probably leave in one year. 

Second, the 24 month OPT extension policy does help to boost both U.S. technology and economy in the long run. When I was studying at the University of Michigan, there were very few American students interested in engineering. My major is eletrical engineering and less than of the students are Americans. If the STEM OPT extension is cancelled, most of the international students will probably make preparations for seeking jobs in their home country instead of U.S, in which case, it will be difficult for the technology companies to find enough qualified employees to keep the company running healthy.
