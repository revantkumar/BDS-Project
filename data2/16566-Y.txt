I think it's a wise policy to improve and expand Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students. Based on what I observed, nowadays there is a huge need for high-tech talents. Personally, I have some friends working in tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon etc.). I would say what they did really changed our lives. Without their effort, we would have had no way to enjoy our lives as we do right now. If we allow nonimmigrant students to work in United States, I'm sure they will bring more jobs and also benefit the whole society. Thus, I strongly support this proposal.
