Yan Lee I DO NOT support this proposal. OPT extension for 24 month is against the benefits of US labors. I hold my opinion for the following reasons: 
1. Including the 24-month OPT extension, its total of 36 months for international students to work in the United States. After 3 years, there is no guarantee that the employee will stay with the same company once they get H1B visa. Please check the statistics of students who changes their jobs immediately after they get H1B visa. The actual number will support my point.
2.There are too many international students crowded in the job market trying to compete with US labors who will trying to get the job by lowering their salaries. In the meantime, the non-employment rate is still rocket high. I don not against talented young professions to join the US labor force. I just do not agree too many international labors into the market for too long. An 12 month extension, a total of 24 months, would be more than sufficient for the best of the international students to work and live in the US eventually.
