Liang Yang I am totally voting for the OPT extension. As one of international students, I came all the way to United States to not just receive higher and better education but also to love this multi-cultural country. After graduation, want to contribute to this country and at the mean time get practical working experience. If the 24-month OPT extension doesn't get approved, it will be our loss for not having enough time to work in somewhere we love. However, it will also be a loss for U.S. companies. A very large portion of talents will be lost due to termination of legal working authorization. Think smart. Think for this country.
