1) The OPT extension attracts foreign students to the United States, who pay expensive out-of-state graduate school tuition and taxes to the US government. Students, who spend tens of thousands dollars for tuition and living expense per year, come to US in the hope that the OPT experience after graduation could be a better leverage for their future career at their home countries. If this advantage is gone, there are plenty of other choices like universities with good engineering and science program in Europe, which quite often are tuition-free.

2) If any corporate is going to hire any foreign student, they only hire the BEST, who advance the entire American high-tech industry. There are plenty of foreign STEM students (even with OPT extension) who are not able to obtain any full-time job after graduation because they are not good enough. And those who are able to be employed, they can produce valuable patented technologies and research findings, from which America can benefit for years even after their period of employment. The foreign student doesn't necessarily take the job from American student. If there were two students (an international and an American) with the same GPA, same project experience and the same type of degree, the American student would definitely have way more job opportunities than the international student.
