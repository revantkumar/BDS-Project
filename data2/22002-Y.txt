The proposed new immigration regulations are not needed. Thirty percent of the working-age citizens of this country are without jobs - more if you count those who have been forced into part-time jobs. This will do NOTHING to help the unemployed of this country and will, in fact, make it much worse. 

I have as big a heart as anyone when it comes to helping people from other countries who are looking for a better life ---- but not if doing so destroys the better life for citizens in this country. In order to help others, you must be in a position to do so - and at this rate, we're not even in a position to help ourselves. I thought the purpose of our government was to HELP THEIR OWN first. What happened to that concept of helping those who pay taxes and vote for you?

This is most disturbing.
