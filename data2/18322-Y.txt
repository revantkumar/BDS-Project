As an engineering PhD student, I am really appreciate the opportunity that U.S. gave to me for pursuing my degree here. So far, as far as I know, this country has the best graduate school education (and why we came). Many PhD candidates, like me, received more than $ 100k funding from the school (4 to 5 years), plus around $ 40k from internship. The experience and knowledge is much more valuable than the money. I believe many foreign students, like me, love to stay in the U.S. and contribute a little bit after we graduate. I dont think the majority of U.S. people like the idea that investigating us and let us serve for other countries. Every time I went to conferences, there are industrial leaders asked if I would like to stay. If I said yes, they are happy because U.S. economic needs hard working, well-trained employee.
If all STEM graduate students leave U.S. and work for other countries, it is not reasonable. Why U.S. spends so much money and time help training his competing countries?
