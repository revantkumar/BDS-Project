I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. As a STEM student, the reason that I chose coming to America rather than Canada or Europe was because I could get at least 2 years time to learn how the real industry is doing. I could gain working experience to build up myself rather than just a diploma. Actually, the most useful knowledge I learned for the last 2 years was not what the professors taught at class. The one year's internship in a pharmaceutical company is my invaluable treasure. Without this OPT advantage, I would not get abroad being alone for 2 years to get a stupid diploma. And now, I was told even the OPT extension would be cancelled. I feel cheated. And if doing so, you are losing your faith in international students.
