I am in biostatistics major. And more than half of the population in this major are international people. They learned excellent skills and knowledge in America and kept contributing to making improvement in public health. Go to read the top article in this major, you will find a bunch of international persons as the author. They are all benefited by the STEM program and tried their best to give back to America. 

On another hand, if STEM is shorten, lost half of excellent person in biostatistics area is a huge damage to American public health.
