Johnson Cogil I support this STEM opt rule proposal. US economy is built on fair competition. This competition will benefit US citizen student, give them more motivation to perform better in education and job. This extension gives a fair chance to international students to compete and find a job. International students work hard and retain the jobs because they have too much at stake. They have proven to be great workers and an asset to many companies all across the US.
