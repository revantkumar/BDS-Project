I am a Mechanical Engineering Student who was fortunate enough to have off-campus internships every summer during my college career. That leaves me with 3 months left from the initial 12 mo. period. after my graduation in June. A 17 mo. extension will give me 20 months = one chance at the H1B lottery. I'm a good student with desirable abilities. I've received multiple offers already prior to my graduation. It is no fair to both me and the company of my choice to have to train me for one year, gamble a <30% chance of being elected and risk of my leaving my workplace 20 months later. Engineers are rare, and good ones like me are rarer. We can really contribute to the US economy and are truly looking to become a US citizen in the future. We work hard, loves America and I believe we deserve the right to stay here, where the USA is built by immigrants like me in the first place.
