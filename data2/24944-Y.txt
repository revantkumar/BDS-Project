I really support this move.The extention of OPT seems only to benefit the F-1 students but actually it benefits the US economy in the long run. We have all known in recent years, US studnets' ability in math, physics and some other science-related subjects are declining. For the continued development of relevant industries and to maintain their competitiveness, it is necessary to attract foreign students to work in US. Some US citizens may argue that it poses threats to the opportunities of local people. However, it is not true. with more competition brought by F-1 students, it is more likely the local students will strength their capability in STEM subjects in the long-term. But if those F-1 students are forced back to their home countries, it is highly possible that more American jobs are outsourced to other countries and there are just fewer jobs offered to local people.
