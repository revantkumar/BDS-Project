I think the extension of OPT would be highly beneficial to the US in several aspects. First, it helps the academic level of colleges and universities remain leading position around the world. If the STEM is cancelled ,many student might have chosen Britain or Canada as their first choice of studying aboard. Second, foreign students have contributed a lot to the renting market, restaurants entertainment industry of almost all major cities within the states. This great potential of consuming would definitely do good to the economy especially when the US economy is in the essential phase of recovery. Last but not least ,many key scientific projects of the country need foreign students to make their contributions. With the math, programming ,physics and chemistry knowledge offered by foreign students, these projects and researches would then accelerate and finally yield new medication and new technology application which at last would benefit all citizens to improve their living quality and living environment. Therefore, in general , I think the extension of OPT would be a great help for the whole country itself
