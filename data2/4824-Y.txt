I cannot imagine the day when OPT extension for STEM disappears, it must be like a disaster, not only for new graduates like us who just got a degree through significant days and nights of effort and then got a job with god blessing luck, but also for thousands of US companies who hired so much outstanding and dedicated international employees taking care of important jobs that cannot be taken over in a short time. I am from the field of Electrical Engineering, I have to say that people working in the engineering field is by no means someone who makes money by easy work that can be leaned through days of training, the skills they master are all on the basis of years of leaning extremely boring and difficult stuff from books that most people have little interest in even cast a glance at. Undoubtedly, it take so much educational resources to lay the foundation of an engineer, not even to say the cost spent by a company to get a senior engineer with rich experience in working. And the essential period for an engineer to make progress and grow up as a senior is the first several years during his or her career. Needless to say how terrible loss in resources and how many talented people that human technology is going to rely on will get wasted and lost. It is the most common belief that people living on this planet could do whatever they want and they can to make it a better place, now this is exactly what we engineers doing, why not give us the chance to change the world?
