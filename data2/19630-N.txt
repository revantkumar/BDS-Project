Not only am I against expanding the EAD program I believe it should be eliminated for a number of years to deal with the 
problem of unemployed Americans who have gave up looking for jobs. It is way past time for the government to put the 
interests of Americans first and not those of foreigners. In addition, there is an increasing use of automation for the production
of goods and services that will rule out the employment of humans. In short, the US does not need anymore immigration, H-1B
visa holders or more people brought in under the EAD.
