Jay Wong I fully support this new OPT extension. 

24 month OPT is really important for STEM student, so does the tech company. For example, in our team, some of the large/important project will last up to a year. And before an international students can take such big project, we usually need to train them half a year or so. Under the old OPT extension, the student can barely finish that kind of project. With 24 month OPT extension, it will greatly benefit my company and my international student employee. And I don't think this will reduce job opportunities for citizens, since we are always in short of skilled engineers.
