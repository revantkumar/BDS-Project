The DHS proposed Optional Training Program is an absurdity on several levels.
There is NO ROLE for the DHS to be involved in education, foreign or domestic.
The program is just another foreign country SUBSIDY to many who have no support for the USA.
The OPT denies Americans jobs.
The OPT ROBS Social Security and Medicare which already are in trouble.
The intent of training foreign students to return home and help their country is NOT being met.
The problem of SECURITY which is the DHS role is obviously being jeopardized- unbelievable!
If the need exists for certain categories of workers to be trained, WHY IN GODS NAME does the 
DHS want to train foreigners instead of American students who already can not find jobs?
This entire program needs to be eliminated and the savings can hep reduce the 18 trillion debt!
