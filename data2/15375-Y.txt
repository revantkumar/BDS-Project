Why is the immigration system broke? because people in power choose to ignore what is already there. I believe people in power who flaunt the law should be held accountable and and be prosecuted! All those who vote to pass "amnesty" should be held accountable also. common sense should tell you if youre going to give amnesty to 12 million people...you better come up with 11-12 million new jobs...QUICK. oh...make that about 20-25 million new jobs to cover the AMERICANS who need to work and support their families. please...someone help me find the american dream.
