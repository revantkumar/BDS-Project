Expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students is a good idea. 

Thousands of nonimmigrant students are working or will work for American technology companies which means thousands of high educated people provide their experience and knowledge to American companies. One obvious thing is that there are a lot more international students than American students in those STEM Degrees programs. At the same time, the job market is huge when lots of companies are growing and need more high educated employees. Also, I did not see nonimmigrant students are competing with American employees. Companies more care about the performance and experience of the candidates. And there are lots of jobs are only for American citizenships. 

Lets think of what will happen if this policy is not proved. Thousands of international students need to go back to their countries immediately. Lots of companies loose human resource in a short time, which will effect their production or research. The students who want to study in the US reconsider their decision. They highly possible change their plan and apply European Universities with lower tuition fee and same education quality because American university and society is no longer attractive. After that, fewer students means less money come to the US and it's pretty obvious there are not enough American students major in STEM degrees. And companies cannot hire enough high educated people. What a disaster!

Because I really cannot see any negative effect happening to the US because of the expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students. I can see American can get huge benefit from it. So I surely support this policy!
