I highly support that the this STEM extend to 24 months. I currently work in an USA tech 
company, almost 80% of our colleges are Nonimmigrant student or do not have US citizen- ship or green card yet. What's more, as far as I know, 80% of the tech companies are in the same situation. Let's say if we don't have more time working in a legal way, these companies will lose a big amount of elites.
Just look and see how many Chinese and Indian tech elites are working in Silicon valley right now and how much fortune and contribution they have made for the USA and whole world.

Without the STEM 24months extension, it will certainly affect the US's both economy and technology market. 

Also if we don't have the STEM extension, it will also influence USA to attract international students to apply for USA's university in the future.

As far as I can see, the 24 month STEM extension will bring all good things to America and the improvements of technology and economy among whole world.

In a summary, I strongly support the 24 months STEM extension!!
