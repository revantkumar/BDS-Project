The scenario of workforce requirements in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math have changed in the past few years. These fields now require workforce with more advanced skill set to research, innovate and sustain the technological advancements.

The progress of any nation depends on the solutions provided by these technological advancements in STEM fields.

Therefore, it becomes more important to provide opportunity for individuals with advanced degrees to contribute in these fields by extending the OPT period up to 24 months.

It is a very insightful and prudent move by DHS and I applaud them for the same.
