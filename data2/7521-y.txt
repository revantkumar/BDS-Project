Maude Lefebvre Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.
