I am a student who wants to pursue a mater degree in United States. I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. I admit that the level of education in USA is high, but honestly speaking, having a chance to gain work experience in Top IT companies after graduation is the most appealing to excellent students. We spend much money on education hoping to have a great future career. It's obvious that foreigners have made great contributions on the development of USA economy and technology. I think it's a win-win for both USA and international students. If OPT extension were cancelled, I do believe many students will make a different decision.
