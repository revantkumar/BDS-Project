I strongly support the proposal. Spending less money to hire a qualified candidate is always a company's principle. It exists not only between an American and a foreigner, but also two Americans. Anyone can contribute more, anyone makes the company believe he/she worth the pay will get hired. Think from a company's standpoint, it's not charity.
