Chonghui Zhang I strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant student with STEM degrees. 
From my personal experience, I think 24-month STEM OPT extension is less disruptive for employers by lengthen the devoting time of F-1 employee and reduce repeat training cost of the employer. I am a beneficiary from the 17-month STEM OPT extension. Last year I was hired by a local construction company as a construction professional who can also help them to communicate with their potential Chinese client. The amount of the money this Chinese company has invested is one of largest that Chinese companies ever did in the US. It has been a year and half since our team worked on the construction projects for this Chinese company and there are more construction work coming soon. This Chinese company will create 2,000-3,000 jobs and they already have more than 400 employees now when their facility is still under construction. It takes time to learn work related skill as well as adapt to the company culture, but it takes more time to know your client when they come from a completely different country. Therefore I think longer OPT extension can help international student to finish larger scale projects or researches they are currently working on without disruptive their employers.
