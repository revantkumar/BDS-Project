Strongly agree to extend the OPT.
America needs bright young minds to boost its economy and make her a leading country in important aspects around the world. Students need opportunities to enhance their future careers, whether they will or will not eventually stay in this country.
This is definitely mutually beneficial and win-win. 
Don't forget, everyone in this country, except the native Americans were once immigrants. America gave job opportunities to non-native Americans, why can't America give opportunities to students?
