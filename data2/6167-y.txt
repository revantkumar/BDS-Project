Jessica Jiang I can't get any reason do deny this proposal. Training opportunities come with studying opportunities and fairness. Since we offer the International students studying in the United States, we should provide enough time and fair opportunities for them to practice. In the same time, this proposal will insure and test our education system and quality.If working well, it also attracts more talents and students coming into the USA to study and contribute.
Especially, the STEM degrees need longer term to practice. In addition, so many companies need this kind talents and employees.
