Cindy Cheng I strongly support the idea of the extension of OPT.
First of all, STEM students are working at the academic fields and is still the most important driving force of the nation's economy. 
Secondly, people have been arguing about this is not good for the next generation of US. However, the best way for the next generation of America is to provide better education not to get rid of immigrants. The extension of OPT is going to attract more foreign students come to study in the US and all colleges will benefit from this. 
Last but not least, it is the spirit of US that we have to treat everybody equally.God Bless!
