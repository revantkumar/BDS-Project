US is an opening country and you should give the most brilliant people the chance to work here! If the expanding is cancelled, it is unfair to both the employers and the international students! If an international student is good enough, he or she deserves a job here and the employers deserve a good employee like that!

Also, I have to say that this expansion does not have much impact on most American. International students are just allow to work in the aspect they major in. For STEM students, most of them are in engineering which only a small portion of American choose to learn!
