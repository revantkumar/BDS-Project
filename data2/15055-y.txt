Jia Wu I totally support the new rule. 
Most of the foreign workers are well educated. They work for big companies and research institutions. Those companies know how difficult to hire someone that qualifies for the positions. I never heard they have any different salary standards set for the foreign workers. Those people's good performances are treasured and they are well paid. 
For those native Americans majored in STEM, I don't think this rule will create any unfair competition for them. It's generally pretty difficult for a foreign student to find a job in the United States. They need to overcome the language barrier, and they still need to have outstanding academic performances. So only the best of the best among the foreign students could find a good job which doesn't care about the trouble in hiring a foreign talent.
The current situation is pretty tough already. This new rule will help fix the broken immigration a little bit. We are going in the right direction. This rule should be embraced and fully supported by all people.
