Xiangxing Cao I totally agree with the strategy for expanding and improving the F-1 student OPT with STEMdegrees and Cap-Gap relief for all F-1 student;

Foe myself, I'm working in one third vehicle OEM (original equipment manufacturer) - FORD for one year, the situation in my department is like one third of employees are foreign people, and most senior engineers were F-1 non-immigrant students before. as one of the biggest vehicle manufacturer, the F-1 students are absolutely required for fulfilling lots of engineer positions, the reasons are because of lacking of specific American engineer students. Since I was studying my master degree in Detroit beofre, I know that 95% people who studied the master degree of Mechanical Engineering's class are established by Chinese and Indian, and only one or two native people in the class. Under this situation, The three biggest vehicle company can't find enough suitable American to fulfill the engineering position, if OPT extension has been cancelled, the OEMs will lose tons of F-1 students which are the core power in company, and as you may know, if the hired Americans aren't suitable people, the American vehicles will definitely lose the competitive abilities in the world. If you think further, once the OEMs can't sell their products to world, the native people will lose jobs, and unemployment rate will rise, that's a very bad circle for American society.

The information above is about what I've seen, I also collect some data which can indicate the values, the F-1 students have made in the past, in the Association of International Educators website, we can see that 886,052 F-1 students have made about 26.8 billion profit in the past 2013 to 2014 year, and also support around 340,000 American people's jobs! The data is telling the truth about the F-1 students' value! I also attach these information for USCIS to see.

Above all, for myself I definitely agree with the F-1 OPT extension, for America, there are also tons of benefits for native people, so that I really hope the improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students can be agreed sucessfully.
