Dear officer,

As an international student, I strongly support this bill not only because I can gain some industry experience after graduation but also speak of normal American people who do their business with international students. 

Of course, if we do not have OPT and OPT extension, there are fewer students willing come to USA for study. You know the tuition is very expensive and I can say most of the students come to USA are very good students in their original countries. They have very strong academical background and very good person. And you can see from school, USA native students are much less than international students in engineering school, so people complain that we took their jobs are not correct, the fact is few native students want to learn engineering, but the demand for good engineers are still keep growing and become higher and higher. So, the best solution for this issue is hire good, talented international students, which is important for big companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.

What's more, some people opposed this bill and believe companies pay less to hire an international student than a native student, which is not true neither!!! Do a simple research, in silicon valley, engineer for entry level has pretty similar salaries no matter native students or native students. They earn their money based on their ability, not their nationalities. If they have better technical skill, of course they will earn more. 

Last but not least, USA should be a super country and welcome the diversities. I can see some extreme racist comments here and feel sick about it. I hope everyone can stay with each other happily because we are all human being not some animals want to protect your own nest keep others away.
