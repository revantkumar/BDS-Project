David Crippen The ICEB expansion of the rule to allow more foreign students to come to the US to work during training makes no sense. 
We have lots of American students that need these jobs and the training associated with them to preclude bringing in more
foreign workers. Until the American labor force is full of Americans, don't bring in more foreign people. 
Instead, support local schools to improve the education and especially STEM programs to grow our own technical workers.

We have too many Americans out of work already, do not make it worse. Use the money to provide opportunities for our students.
