I support this rule for the following reasons :

First, it should be fair to everyone to seek for chance of working. It is reasonable that people should practice skills in real work situation after graduation.

Second, it is attractive for those talented people to come to the US if this rule realized.

Last but not the least, it is good for those companies in the US which deal with lots of international issues if they have more international employees and show the multi-culture to the world.
