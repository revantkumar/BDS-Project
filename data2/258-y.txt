FNU Dapinder Singh Hello,
I am Dapinder Singh an international student and a STEM graduate student in Electrical engineering.The STEM proposed extension is a welcome rule from a students perspective and from US economy extension.My reasons are as follows.
1) America is the great country due to the fact hard working immigrants from all over the world keeping their lives at stake to work hard here to live their dreams which at the same time makes this place a land of opportunities.
2)I believe the extension should be 36 months because this gives ample work experience to students and employer the opportunity to receive the best services.
3) Besides a lot of US universities receives millions of dollars in revenue due to large number of students from countries like India and China .
4) If the extension is removed ,the number of students coming to US will fall dramatically most definitely which will be heart breaking for students and at the same time detrimental to US economy as this will no longer be a land of opportunities.
5)History is evident that hard working immigrants at later stages in life create jobs and entrepreneurship in US which makes the whole world envious of US.
6)There is no reason for US citizens to be skeptical of it because no data supports the fact that immigrants are taking their jobs .Besides this is called STEM extension for a reason .Any hard working citizen finds a job with much more ease as compared to F-1 students if they have even 70% the same skills.
6) Besides supporting extension I will like to add that going through the rule, amount of extra paper work for the employer is overwhelming and can prevent small companies from hiring which is unfair for the small employers.Please consider making the paper work easier and extension worth 36 months.
