Baback Izadi I support the proposed rule extending STEM optional practical training (OPT) to 24 months and applaud the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for acting to finalize the rule before the court-ordered deadline imposed in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which vacated the current OPT rule on procedural grounds. I also support Immigration and Customs Enforcement's efforts to mitigate court-created uncertainty while at the same time implementing the President's Executive Action calling for the extension and expansion of STEM OPT. To keep United States competitive it is imperative to have the talented workforce. United States graduates a fraction of number of students that countries like China and India graduate in STEM fields. It is senseless to force graduate of these fields to leave the United States.
