We definitely need more international students to build our country's economy. Look at what Rome do when they were trying to conquer the world. They give people chance to become a Roman to help them manage the country. Let alone we are not giving them a formal citizenship just to give them a longer time to stay here. They actually are cheap workforce. Only the ignorant people who doesn't care about this country's future and only care about their own interests will oppose this Regulation.
