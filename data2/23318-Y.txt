I strongly advice that the federal government should expand the OPT program for STEM students for the following reasons:

1. It is the right thing to do. The U.S. is an immigration country. It becomes one of the biggest powers in the world not because it has the highest number of nuclear warhead but because it attracts the best with open-mind. This spirit, however, is not what it's supposed to be anymore, mostly due to opposition from those who are offsprings of immigrants who came here many decades ago, which is conflicted with the idea of american dream, the very foundation of the country. In addition, although member from both parties have a lot of disagreements, most of the lawmakers from both party came to a mutual understanding that legal immigration is good for the interest of the country and the people. Therefore, enhancing the program is not only beneficial but also the right thing to do.

2. It makes sense statistically. There are talented people all over the world, both in the country and outside of the country. Yet, a strong economy requires every talents it can get to come up with new ideas, create new industries, and therefore to create more jobs. Thus, it is mistaken to say that immigrants take over job opportunities created for citizens because the truth is the opposite.

I appreciate your time and effort to go through my comment. And I really hope a decision can be made based on numbers, logic and moral value instead of judgements clouded by emotions.
