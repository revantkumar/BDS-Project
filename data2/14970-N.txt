I think this program is bad for American workers and bad for our country.

OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.

The proposed rule effectively requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination and requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.

We must take care of our own before we offer programs such as this to foreigners.
