I strongly support this rule for below reasons
1 high techlonogy company need more time on training their employee because the background knowledge is much more complicated. 
2 short opt time will force the highly educated international students choose to not work in America. Which is not a good news. Since High tech company is playing a important role in economy and people's daily life. Highly educated employee is necessary in today and future. 
3 reduce the opt time will definitely reduce the number of people who want to study and work in USA. This result will affect the economy.
