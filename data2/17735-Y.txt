We have become amazed at the fool hearty plans of this Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau. Why would anyone who values this country and the people in this country develop incentives that favor citizens from other countries? The answer is clear. This agency clearly declares to all that they DO NOT value the country of America or the people of this country. As a parent of one of the students that finished his Phd. and found it difficult to get a job, I cannot recommend these individuals who thought up this con for any job position in the United States. This plan is not an improvement. It is an intentional, additional step in the deterioration of our economy and job opportunity for the citizens of America under the disguise of altruism.The results are clearly detrimental to citizens seeking employment and clearly experienced by our 97 million citizens who are no longer in the job force but not recorded in the phony unemployment numbers.

It is my understanding that in the immigration laws that seem to be ignored with this plan, that bringing citizens from other countries infringes on the employment of American citizens, entrance for employment is to be denied. This administration is flooding the U.S. with foreign job seekers and providing tax incentives to businesses to hire non citizens. Non citizens are encouraged and envied to come here and informed as to how to benefit from our welfare and other social programs to the point of invasion status. 

Any one who supports this favoritism of non citizens over the citizens of this country who also have worked for the training to be equipped for employment is not working for America.
