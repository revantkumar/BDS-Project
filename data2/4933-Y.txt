I being an American Citizen support this rule. I know that Indians are taking away most of the STEM Jobs but on the flip side I also see that most of the Americans are finding jobs in Managerial Positions. I see a trend, let them take care of the technical side while we tell them what and how we want it to me done. Trust me it a good thing.
