I am an international student. I am very lucky to find a job after my graduation this year. So the opt extension really affect my life and career. In my opinion, the first thing I want to work in America is to accumulate my working experience. I work very hard to make benefit for my company. And my boss and colleagues really like me and support me to stay here. It is them to give the inspiration to work in US, now I love here. I really want to get more opportunities to get my H1B1 visa. Yes, I am an foreigner student in US, but I got a great passion to work and I make benefit to my company and US. So, please pass the proposed rule to extend F1 student period. This means so much for me. Thank you.
