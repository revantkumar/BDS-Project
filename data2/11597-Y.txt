As seen from the previous years, highly skilled immigrants have made huge contributions in innovation and research. With this comes more jobs and opportunities. It is my firm belief that immigrants need to be given the time and benefit of the superior technology in America to help build the foundation for a culturally diverse, fundamentally strong economy that will help everyone live better lives. The 24 month extension on the OPT , will help immigrants create an environment of chance and opportunity and show their worth in making this country great.
