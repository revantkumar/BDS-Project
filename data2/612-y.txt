Niao Xiao I totally agree with new rule to improve and expand the training opportunities for foreign students. The reasons for this are simple:

1. What DHL posted is already showing all the advantages that what OPT will bring, it benefits not only US high tech companies but also US society and then all US citizen accordingly. 

2. As the lead country in the world, USA attracts a lot of excellent people from other countries, most of them went to school in USA. With the approve of this new rule, there will be more foreign students willing to come here for degrees. So all US universities and colleges don't need to worry about their income and even research budget.

3. Let's take a look that we USA needs OPT, it's because there are many employment demands that US citizens only couldn't fulfill. If this rule is abandoned, many IT companies will be running out of enough qualified employee and may even go bankrupt.

I hope this rule will be approved, and look forward to see the benefits it brings. Thank you!
