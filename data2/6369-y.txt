Carol Longmuir The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.
The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers.
Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.
OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.
Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.
OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.
OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.
Isn't it about time that you put the American people before foreigners. We have qualified people that need jobs! There are just too many Americans that need jobs to provide the jobs to foreigners just because it is cheaper for the companies to hire them and not pay payroll taxes on top of it!!
