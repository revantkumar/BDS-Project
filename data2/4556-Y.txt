You may not believe how many of my international friends offered their support when I was in my hardest time. Today I am fighting for them. If you have a friend, or someone you really care is international, you should probably fight for them with me.

Maybe most of us do not know OPT. It lets international students with a U.S. student visa work for 12 months at jobs or paid internships that relate to what they studied without needing to apply for a work visa. Some of them got good job opportunities but cannot stay just because they used their OPT up. They did;t even did anything wrong.

I believe if a student is qualify for STEM positions in America, he/she deserves to stay, no matter where he/she comes from. I support OPT extension and hope it will help my friends stay longer with me, and got great career development opportunity.
