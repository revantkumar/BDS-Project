I believe this is a beneficial action to take for the whole country. STEM students have proved that they did contribute much more than normal students in the long run. Without their contribution, there will be a huge impact in a lot of areas, such as IT, GT, Research, Quantitative analysis, etc. Our country invests a good amount of resource in these students, and it will be a good idea to keep them here longer to see their contributions to our country.
