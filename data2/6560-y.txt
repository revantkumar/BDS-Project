sarah wimer Since the beginning of history, humans have immigrated. The large recent increase in the immigrant population (both legal and illegal) has greatly benefited our country. Immigrants are known as hard workers. They take many undesirable jobs--such as nursing homes, janitorial, dangerous construction, dishwashing, meat packing--essential to keeping our economy functioning. At the same time, many leave places of extreme violence and insufficient food , water, and shelter. We need to recognize that the latest wave of immigrants without documentation are making significant contributions, just like all the previous waves of immigrants to our shores. They deserve to have their hard work recognized and to be given a path to legality.
