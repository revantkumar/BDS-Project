I strongly support the proposal. This proposal is very good fro the following reasons:

1. A lot of important breakthroughs are achieved by international students and fellows. And this proposal is very important for these students to put their talent on real jobs to make contribution to the U.S society. 

2. U.S government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S universities to stay in this country to make contributions to this society, rather than push them back to their own countries. Or this will be a very large waste of education resource.

3. Somebody concern about the competition. There does exist competition, but it's not that bad. Moreover, with these student exist in our country, our students will be stimulated and become more and more competitive. 

Thus, I STRONGLY support the proposal.
