Meng Zhang I am an international student from China. I came to America to read master degree until next year. So OPT policy is really helpful to give me authority to work in United States. As we all know, United States aggregate the most intelligent people all over the world, in different aspects of society, politics, economics, finance, technology ann so on. Many young people try their best to study hard in order to have the best education in United States, while only a small percentage of them can get scholarship, the rest have to spend high tuition, so they are more desired to earn a job after graduation. Studying abroad is difficult for international students, no matter on life or study, so they need more time to get accommodated with American society, if only one year, time is too urgent to achieve their dream and find out what their interests are. United States propose to provide equal rights to every person, while for international students, they suffer more difficulties in looking for a job because of the sponsorship, so OPT policy is the best method for them to achieve the first step for success. Considering all the benefits of all the international students, United States government should give opportunity to let more young people realize their dream, not restrict their growth because of talent competition. International students should hold same stage as Americans at long as they have ability to make contributions to the society. So I strongly support the extension of OPT policy.
