Eddy Hector I strongly agree the OPT ext program not only helps new graduated students to obtain necessary training but also stimulates the economy of the United States. And I object to the statements that US Citizens are out of work because of the OPT program. The facts are just the opposite. The States can grow stronger and the economy will continuously expands with the contribution of the high-tech professionals, who are partially consists of the students benefits from the OPT ext program, especially when this program is for STEM majors. The value contributed by these professionals actually enhances the economy, hence provides more job openings for U.S citizens. 

It is a fairly good program.
