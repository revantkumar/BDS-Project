At a time when nearly 40% of the American citizen workforce is unemployed and dependent on the government for support, this Optional Practical Training proposal to offer incentives for employers to hire foreign STEM workers is absolute lunacy. It would just make it harder for citizens to find jobs and become productive workers. If you want to do something it should be to put a priority on jobs for citizens. This proposal just makes our jobs and employment problems worse and I OPPOSE IT.
