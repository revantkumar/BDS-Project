Thomas Wnek To whom it may concern:

I strongly agree that OPT STEM Extension should be extended to 3 years. The reasons are as follows.

1. It will benefit the economy of the whole country. Within the 3 years in United States, those STEM students will make considerable contribution to the industries as well as the economy. The improved economy will create more job openings in the country.

2. It will benefit the local economy. Within the 3 years in United States, those students will have a significant amount of consumption, which will benefit the local economy.

3. It will dramatically benefit the companies where the STEM students work. Most of the projects in the company need 3 or more years to finish. It will be a disaster if the company loses the students before the project is completed.

4. Three years of OPT will attract more talented students to come to Unite States for education. The colleges will benefit. 

In summary, the three years OPT policy will boost the economy which will create more job openings. People living in the country will directly or indirectly benefit from this policy.

Thank you,
