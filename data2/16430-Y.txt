I totally support the opt-extension rule. Diversity is very important in US. In fact, many contributions are made by the foreign talents in US. And rather than taking the local people's working opportunities, OPT extension may help bring more opportunities to the companies since they can get access to a larger range of candidates and get better workers. The competition will help promote the abilities of the workers and improve the competitive ability of American economy. Besides, since there are a large number of students coming to USA to study, a large amount of money are invested to the research and innovative programs for these part of students. It's a good chance to get more profits back by hiring the foreign talents and also to some aspects get more tax incomes. Finally, many programs need length of years to finish such as some research programs in the engineering company. And the extension of opt can help prevent the program to be abruptly stopped because foreign participants in the program don't have authorized visa to stay in the country. 
All in all, I strongly support the opt-extension rule.
