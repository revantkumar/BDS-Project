shelley sha If revoke extension, once 12 month OPT student doesn't get H1B, he has to stop his running programm in any US company. This would bring a lot of bad influence to the companies who has OPT students doing the basic job. And this can bring a lose situation.

Foreign students feel harder to gain more time in USA to practice the learning skills, then less foreign students will come to study in USA. Eventually, many US universities, local renting, etc etc will take the big big loss.
