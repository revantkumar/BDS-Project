Olga Woolley International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. If this rule is not passed, foreign STEM grads will take their skills and education to their home countries, costing America the opportunity for job-creating innovation. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM.
