The OPT program should have as a priority Americans who want to be able to enter into STEM careers. There two important points to consider. 1. OPT has resulted in the denial of more than 430,000 jobs to American workers during the time period of 2009-2013. 2. OPT has resulted in the removal of $4 billion
from the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. The purpose of OPT is being
defeated in that foreign students are taking advantage of the program as a bridge to stay in the United States whereas the purpose of OPT was to give them
the tools to help their home countries upon their return. The worst part of how the OPT program is financed is the drain on the Social Security and Medicare Trust funds. I for one rely on my Social Security to pay bills and the help pay the mortgage on the house I live in. Medicare is needed for people to who otherwise don't have health insurance. The rule that DHS is proposing defeats the purpose of OPT. The way the program is being handled now
is wrong and the proposed rule will make the situation worst.
