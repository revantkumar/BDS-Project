Ziyu Ji America shouldn't abuse it's education and research resources to aggregate world talents in any form, including this STEM OPT extension rule. I'm always concerned about having one super country leading the science & technology advancement of human race. It breaks the balance between countries even more by granting America unfair advantage over science and tech, which can lead to catastrophic result, including abusive of power (e.g. Iraq wars), and ultimately destroying the variety of human cultures. An ecosystem without variety is fragile. A world without culture variety is without hope. Imagine if America is infected with Nazism, who can stop it? 
So instead, America should create an easy passage to allow STEM talents to reflow back to the world. This way, not only native workers in tech sectors are happy with less competition and potentially increasing employment rate, but more importantly, allowing competing countries like China to thrive, ensuring world balance with culture varieties.
