To make my position clear. I am an F1 student on OPT right now, and work fulltime.
(I might need to apply for the extension at the end of next year, if I don't have the luck in the H1B lottery).

I strongly support this proposal.
Due to the limited time, I am not going to polish my words too much, but want to make some points on the reason why this proposal should be passed.

1. The demand of qualified STEM employees with advanced degree is higher than the provision. There is no threat to the job security of most native americans.
2. Diversity, and attracting talents over the world is always the cornerstone of keeping U.S. at the pioneer position in the world. 
3. Having more STEM background workforces actually stimulate the development of economy, and help create more working opportunities in a long term.
4. The U.S. education system has dedicated a significant efforts and resource to international students, driving them away without getting any returns sounds a very unwise approach.
5. Other immigration regulations like the H1B quota have already limited the number of total international students to work in U.S. This is also not a wise way.
6. Big company (Google, Facebook, Bloomberg, Amazon ...) support F1 based employees to work in other countries. The major reason is they cannot find enough qualified people here. More and more companies have to resort to this uneconomical option. 

The above are my instant thoughts in 10 mins.
Thanks for reading this.
