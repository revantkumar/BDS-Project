I am definately in favor of this proposal, it is useful for the U.S. in many aspects. 
1. Expanding the training opportunities means more chances for international students to work, that must contributes much to America's economy.
2. This will not have impact on local American's work opportunities because the proportion of international worker to native work remains in a low level.
3. America should embrace more international students and workers to meet the trend of gloablization.
