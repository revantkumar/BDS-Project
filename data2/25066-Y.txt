I would like to SUPPORT OPT extension to 24 months for the following reasons:

1. International students with skills learnt from US university should not leave the country because of this, they should serve the country for the benefits of our country.

2. They PAY taxes in OPT extension, Actually I know a lot of OPT students are in high tech companies and they contribute a lot to the country's tax.

3. A lot of Americans do not choose the OPT supported majors like computer science, electric engineering. But with a big demand for those engineers, if OPT did not extended to 24 months, lots of high tech companies will lose a lot of potential good employees and reduce the compatibility with the other high tech companies from other countries.

4. The international students with more than 2 years working experience in US will be more likely to do business with US after they go back to their motherland. This is defiantly good for the economy. 

5. One of the good attraction for US universities is that students can have opportunities to work in US for several years before they come back. If OPT extension is too short or even canceled, then the US universities will lose their attraction compared with the universities from the other countries. It would be a huge lose for US universities.
