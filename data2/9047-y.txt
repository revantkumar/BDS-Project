Augustino Watson Varikkatt STEM graduates aimed to study at the United States in prospect of good jobs after which they could support themselves along with helping the economy grow. US has always put forward globally the value that is it is a fair global platform with opportunities for everyone who is capable, and so far has justified this. As a result, we have thousands of international students coming to the country because they believed they would given the opportunity they deserved in the STEM fields. 

Taking off the OPT extension rule fails the values that US is built all these years. No student will ever consider it the land of opportunity and the student bringing in International revenue would be reduced manifolds.

Taking off International students from the local job market is no way going to be of any benefit for US firms, lack of skilled expertise is eventually going to bring in the need of outsourcing, which means giving money out to the rest of the world.

Taking off the rule because it was enforced incorrectly should be done in a way that does not impact International students, this rule of a 24 months extension should certainly be enforced in order to be fair.
