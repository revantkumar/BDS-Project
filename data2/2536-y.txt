Xinyi Chen I think extending the OPT training Opportunities is reasonable for the following reason:

1. Company generally incur an operational/internal costs for training of each new hires. After around 1 to 2 years, the employee (with F-1) just become experienced and started to generate value for the company. It would be good for the company if the employee could stay with the company longer.

2. If the hired employee needs to leave country because they used up their training time on OPT, the company has to find replacements and train them all over again.

2. As companies know the cost of 'sponsoring' an international students, the hire of a F-1 student usually means he/she is smart and outstanding. 

3. Extending the training opportunities will help retain the talented person in US.
