I support expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. The reason is simple. They bring more value to this country and make this country more competitive. If we opposite such a simple thing and lose them to make more contribution to this country, I simply can't understand how this country can progress!!!
