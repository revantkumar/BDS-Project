1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.., many people who have given great contribution to the USA history are foreigners.

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. International students don't use low salary to get the jobs which should be done by Americans. They just fill the positions Americans who cannot do.

Last month I got an interview in a it company filled with americans. And I was surprised by the low level they are. They can barely write code. I write some code and none of them know what the code means. So we can see that if there is not enough foreigners working for the it companies, the it industry of USA will face a disaster.
