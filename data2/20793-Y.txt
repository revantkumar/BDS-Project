I firmly support Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

From past decades of years, nonimmigrant students with STEM Degree have made amazing great contributions to United States of America, in Science, Engineering, High-Tech Industries, Bio Industries. All these fields are closely bound up with people's daily life and futures. We know that today America is the leader in such fields among hundreds of countries in the world. I have to say, these nonimmigrant students of F-1 have made all that they could do to help and contributes to the country's prosperity. And I believe such improving and expanding of F-1 opt will benefit more to US !
