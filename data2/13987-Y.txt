Under the current trend of globalization, it seems not to be a proper strategy to shut the door from the outside world. Many local people argue that nonimmigrant aliens take their jobs and competitions are fierce these days. But these facts are good incentives to the innovation of the industry and also U.S. economy. Thanks for the OPT, U.S. gathered well educated and experienced people from other countries to come to U.S. to study and experience the American culture. In this case, more and more people are trying to receive higher education in U.S. which contributes a lot to the economy. Besides, these people, with various culture background, provide valuable opinions to companies they worked for due to different mode of thinking. And because of these opinions, the company may gain a brand-new view on its global strategy which creates more job vacancies in return. Therefore, OPT is actually a good policy. Competition is inevitable nowadays and everybody is going to face that. Instead of complaining at the outside world, for these people who are intimidated by competition, probably it is the time for them to rethink about their own unique values and prepare well for the competition!
