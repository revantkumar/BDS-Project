First I would say I highly support the OPT extension rule. Those people who think that STEM international students grab native jobs may have not considered the real reason of unemployment rate behind. There should be tons of analysis of unemployment cases and you will find this is nothing to STEM international students. I would not waste too many words here explaining this but I want to mention that high-tech companies need STEM international students to work for them and the ultimate goal is to expand the business, in the mean time, creating more jobs in this nation and bringing up prosperity. In other word, this is a win-win strategy which can provide more jobs for people in the US. 

Please be open and from the long term all people will get benefits. Support the new rule and it would be even better to extend the entire OPT thus those skilled professionals will be less stressed while working.
