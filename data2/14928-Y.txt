I strong agree with improving and expanding OPT for F-1 students because:

(1) I believe it is the U.S's spirit to give everyone, including the students from other countries an equal chance to change their lives. Note many of current U.S. citizens are immigrants. That's why we think the U.S. is an equal and free country.

(2) International students cancontribute a lot to the U.S.'s industry. They are working to make the U.S.'s economic better do that we can create more jobs and everyone wins in this situation.
