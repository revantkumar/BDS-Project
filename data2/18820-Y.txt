I support STEM OPT extension. As long as foreign students with STEM majors can find a job, we do not have a reason to let them leave. In my industry, it is very hard to find qualified engineers with a specialized skill set and salaries for STEM fresh graduates are not low at all. The innovations that STEM fresh graduates bring in will actually create more jobs for us, e.g., in university towns and innovative startups.
