Norman Li OPT is really important to keep America the leading position in the world to attract talented people. America is known as multi-race furnace to combine all the gifted people together to create awesome things, if OPT is banned, I can't see any good side for economy or local employment as those who reluctant to work will keep finding excuses instead of actually work and companies might need more resources to find right working force. To conclude, American Dreams should be kept for all the people and I support OPT.
