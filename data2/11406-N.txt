I have a BS degree in electrical engineering and over thirty years of experience. I once again find myself unemployed. I have spent much of my career surrounded by unremarkable foreigners. I have watched my pay being suppressed by these unneeded workers all these years. Student visas should not be used to supplement the gross fraud of the H-1b visa program. Students should come for education, not to displace American workers. F-1 visa holders should come with sufficient funds to self support. The H-1b program should be eliminated.
