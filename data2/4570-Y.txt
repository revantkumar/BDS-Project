Dear DHS,

I support the decision of extending the STEM OPT duration to 36 months from 29. However, the new 'Mentoring and Training Plan' might NOT be a good idea. The paper work will be a burden to the employers and most probably they will be reluctant to hire STEM OPT graduates because of this paperwork which is a great deal. If this happens, there is no point in extending the OPT to either 36 months or more than that. 

Thanks,
Ven
