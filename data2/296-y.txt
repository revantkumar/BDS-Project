Brijesh Meravat, J&J Snack Foods I am one of among thousands non immigrant who is working for US employer being on Stem OPT. Many US employer do not willing to file H1-B petition for their employee immediately upon hiring. This reduces our possibility to attempts to apply for H1-B when the possibility of being selected in lottery (random selection) is reducing as number of petitions are increasing rapidly in recent years.

24 months stem extension would definitely help us in getting one more chance to apply for H1-B. Employer would have assurance that they will not loose their employees if they don't get selected in previous lottery.

I also urge DHS and USCIS to increase H1-1B visas from 85,000 to may be 150,000 that would help foreign worker as well as US employers to retain special skilled employees to help improve US economy on global level.
