Joel Yanovich I support much of the new rule, but the rules regarding the proposed 'Training Plan' needs to be modified. This will create an unnecessary burden on both employers and the university officials charged with reviewing and approving the plans. 

As for how this would impact universities, consider the following hypothetical: Student graduates from University A in a STEM field and then attends University B to get an MBA. After completing an initial period of OPT, the student must receive a recommendation from University B's designated school official (DSO) to work in a position related to the STEM degree received from University A. The DSO may have no familiarity with that student's degree or field of study. This added layer of bureaucracy is an unnecessary hardship.

For employers, this requirement seems excessive. Rather than some type of nebulous training plan, a better option would be a simple form to complete. The form should require various attestations (e.g., "Employer has a system in place to evaluate the OPT worker's performance.") 

In any case, the ability to extend to 24 months is certainly an improvement. So, overall, this is a good start to modernizing the U.S. immigration system.
