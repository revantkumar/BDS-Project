I totally SUPPORT this OPT-EXTENTION program.
I have a lot of coworkers who are international students from all over the world, and they work really hard and we get along with each other very well, but some of them has to leave their position and leave United States just because their OPT issue, I feel so sorry to hear that every time it happens because i think they contribute a lot to this country, and they should have the opportunity to continue work legally. 
I think as a multi-culture country, this program show the world that United States welcome every well-educated and talented people no matter where they are from.
Furthermore, this program will attract more international student to study in our university especially those who major in STEM. It's a good thing for the economy development of US.
