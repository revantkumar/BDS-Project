Three Presidents from two Parties have gone around Congress to take good jobs out of reach of American college graduates. Isn't it time to tell both political establishments to stop?
The Optional Practical Training Program causes a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
I have left out many details, but all are bad for American employment.
Please eliminate this travesty.
