David Jones we need to start taking care of people who are actually citizens of this country and not worrying so much about taking care of folks from other countries. Why don't we start programs to help our kids with school and training since the price of college just keeps sky rocketing and it is almost impossible for a lot of working middle class kids to afford it. I also think it's wrong to use social security and medicare funds (which we pay for in our salary deductions) to be misdirected to programs like this. It's not hard to figure out why these programs struggle when we have people in the federal government that feel like these are slush funds they can use when ever they need money. This isn't why I paid into these funds and I find it disgusting that they are being used this way and to put it simply, give an advantage to immigrant students over our own kids.
