Freida Pan I strongly support the STEM program. Some opposing voices neglect the impact of aborting OPT and stem on the healthcare industry. Without stem, 1.) international students might not even choose healthcare professionals as their career goal because of the fact that they might have zero experience before returning to their home countries and it's undeniable that how important that experiences means to healthcare professionals to find a job. Also, tuitions for stem programs especially life sciences and professional training are experience, thus the U.S would lose those tuitions for certain. 2.) People often neglect the fact that the healthcare industry do need short-term working force. Nowadays, the U.S. healthcare system is short-staffed as it was expanding, for example, International nursing students need to gain experiences before they return to their home country thus they work as PRN ( as needed) status during OPT and stem. In this case, having stem really helps to relief the short-staffed labor market in the healthcare industry. 

Thank you for reviewing my opinion and I hope my concern and voice will be taken into consideration.
