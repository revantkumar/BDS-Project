OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers. It is already
very difficult for American STEM workers to find employment in their field after completing a difficult
challenging college major, and now the jobs will go to lower paid foreign workers! Many US Citizen
STEM workers have to accept lower level jobs not related to their studies. This is unfair and another
reason to hate our government.
