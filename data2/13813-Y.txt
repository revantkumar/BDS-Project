I write this comment to support the extension of OPT by 24 months.
Undoubtedly, the triumph of this country lies on its open and encouraging immigration policies. It is the immigrants who came to this state over the past 300 years that built this country and made this the top country in this world. Only with continuous support for immigrants for high talented foreigners will this country prosper and succeed for the future. 
A closed society where no immigrants are welcomed will lose the opportunity to meet the highly changing world, economically, or technologically. 
So, I fully support the extension of OPT to make this country a better place.
