Xiaochen Lin I strongly approve the proposal to extend the OPT for F-1 students with STEM degrees. 

Reasons why I support the proposal:

1. It does not hurt the interest of the US citizens to allow F-1 students to work during the OPT extension. Those students receive the education in the US and become educated and skilled workers who, themselves, are valuable resource to any country including the US. Having them work in the US on their OPT extension can greatly help the economy of US recover and advance, also strengthen US's leading role in the related markets, such as technology and engineering.

2. F-1 students with OPT extension does not make US citizens lose their jobs. The US job market is always short of qualified workers with STEM degrees. The ideaology that, without F-1 students competing with US workers in related positions, it for sure can increase the salary of the US workers is simply not true. As witnessed many times in the history, the only thing could happen by excluding beneficial competations is a shrinking industry in those areas and to force the business to be moved to overseas.

3. Revoking the OPT extension does not simply imply that F-1 STEM students lose the extension but also means the 12-month OPT is much less useful or meaningful for them. By making them impossible to work in the US legally, it is simply asking them to leave the country right after their graudation.
