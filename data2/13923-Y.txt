I am supportive for OPT Extension policy:

1. It wouldn't do any harm to the employment of local people, but instead that competition would benefit the local economy and individuals' development.

2. Diversity is a value and part of culture in U.S., I believe diversity will continuously drive the prosperity of U.S. economy.

3. It offers fairer opportunity for international students to make self-realization after graduation, they have the chance to make most use of what they learnt in class, therefore they could make sustainable contributions to U.S.
