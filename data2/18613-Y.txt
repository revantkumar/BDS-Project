Although the description in this proposal presents the regulation as being a "good thing" for the nation and our workers, it is in fact, counter to the interest of our students of all ethnicities, backgrounds and creeds who are United States citizens. The simple economic concept that the supply of a good or service ( in this case STEM workers) dictates the cost of said good or service still holds true. Surely, this act will profoundly increase the supply of potential STEM workers which of course... will then result in more competition and less opportunities for American students. As we all know, there are hundreds of thousands of US graduates who cannot land a job in the STEM or other fields... Global competition is a lofty idealistic goal in this case as we must put that aside and address the present employment picture for US students first... not later.. or not at all. Therefore, one must conclude ..based on the above, that it makes absolute zero sense to enact this legislation that if adopted will once again hurt our US students and workers. I strongly you to reject this rule for the benefits of all Americans including the newly arrived naturalized citizens and their families.. Thank you.
