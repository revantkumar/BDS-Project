Totally support this proposal. It is beneficial to both U.S. and talented international students. High Technology industry is driving the economic and it is lack of talented employees. International students are not taking away jobs from American; instead they are meeting the growing demand for talents in high tech and other industries. Many companies cannot have enough people to fill their open positions. Then why do not hire qualified international students? Those companies can get enough qualified workers to keep making progress and those foreign students can get the opportunity to make contribution with their skills and get practical experience. Attracting and retaining talents is the key factor to make progress on economic and social. 

Also, the reason of international students getting jobs is not because of the low salary. In fact, employers need to pay more to hire international students due to the expense to get work authorization. I did not see a foreigner can get a job very easily in America as some comments. A lot of companies do not hire international students or they will prefer to hire employees with U.S. citizen. So it is not unfair to American students. They still have so much advantage to get jobs over international students. 

America is one of the most culturally diverse countries which attract many multinational corporations and talented people from all over the world. They contribute to the development of economic; also those corporations provide a lot of job opportunities. Diversity powers creativity and innovation which drive the America leading the World's economic. Therefore I strongly support this proposal. We can see a lot of benefits for both America and international students.
