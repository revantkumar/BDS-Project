I strongly SUPPORT the extension of OPT and Cap-Gap relief for F1 students. As a STEM major myself, I would like to gain more working experience after college. However, not all opportunities are open to international students. I cannot apply to some great rotational programs because their minimum year requirement exceeds the duration of OPT. Especially in recent years when it is so hard to get H1-B, these companies are even more reluctant to recruit international students, even when we are equally or more qualified for the positions. As there are more and more international students coming in, I believe we should definitely do something to keep the talent pool and therefore contribute to the future growth of the society.
