I might be over thinking this as a lot of it is not clear but we have students here that could use those opportunities here already and should be given consideration first,there are so many other problems facing this Nation now and we need to fix them from the inside. There is plenty of talent here that should not be ignored.Cities full of unemployed under employed and homelessness that needs our attention and our borders are not as secure as they should be.I don't no what kind of wall it would take but one thing that should be done is enforcing the laws we already have; removing illegals in a way that is not overly energetic but smoothly & decisive manner that will get the message across that there is a right way and a wrong way: any other way is an invasion of Our Nation.Our Border watchers should be watched time to time to make sure they are not being threatened or bribed. Make those openings available to some of our kids of age to work.Let them understand that every job is important and the dirt washes off and even the highest & lowest skill level takes the ability to learn how to do a job properly in an efficient manner,keeping in mind that attention is required.One job well done is part of taking a step up.Not everybody starts out rich learning how to budget money also comes into play to start taking care of what is needed 1st then pursuing the luxuries as your abilities progress.In reality not everyone is going to get rich monetarily but character along with good manners opens more doors than a sledge hammer.America needs to take care of itself and it's needs before we give away what we really do not have.Over half of our infrastructure needs replaced or repaired,when our deficits get fixed and we prosper we can afford to be more generous.Don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say is there is nothing wrong with having immigration but their are a great many that have been waiting a long time inline for their turn to come into the USA and should not be bumped o
