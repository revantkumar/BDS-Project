Charles Reynolds After I reviewed so many comments, I STRONGLY support this proposal!

I met with a lot of international students on my work position. They are very hard-working and intelligent. They make a lot of profits for our company. However some local Americans are comparably lazy, since they are Americans and they are protected well by government. I should say that job market is fair for every person. I am not silly to hire people if they are not hard-working or smart. If Americans think international students will grab their jobs, and because of this reason, they want to restrict their work chances, they will never make progress for industry, for our country. We are Americans, great Americans, we should prove ourselves to be better than internationals, to brings unfair treatment for internationals!
