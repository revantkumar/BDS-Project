For those who are able to secure a job right after graduation, and also able to keep being employed during the first year, I do think they are making contribution to whatever area they are working in. So extending that period would definitely be a good thing. Besides, the number of H1B visa issued can always be limited, like right now. So it wouldn't make sense to stop people from making contributions as they have been doing for a year.
