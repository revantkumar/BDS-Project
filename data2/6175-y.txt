Morris Callen I SUPPORT this proposal. International STEM students actually do NOT take American students' jobs.

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. As you know, the students who have the ability to go to the U.S. to study and get their degree are creative and eligible apparently, so it is no hard to understand why the government should let them stay in the country to make a more advanced and diversified society, not only for the current, but also for the future.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Not like most of the other countries in the world, the U.S. is a country containing many races, and all of the people in the country should have the equality right to study, work and develop.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. The majority of international student are good for the development of many fields, so the government shouldnt let them leave the country just in order to offer work opportunity to native people. Letting good academic elites to work for the U.S. is good for the country to maintain its status over the world.
