I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of 
payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these
companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when
they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to
find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

Why our political leaders in both parties fail to make the interests of US citizens (and resident aliens for that matter) a priority
over the interests of big business and foreign nationals, is a question I cannot answer. Supply and demand market forces
apply to as much to labor as they do to other production factors. Our our lax immigration policies have certainly contributed to
stagnate US wages, a declining standard of living and "income inequality" we have experienced over the years.

This proposed rule is but another example of the political class in the US selling out their fellow citizens .
