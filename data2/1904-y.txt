Kanmani Madhavan Here is the thing. 

1. Every individual graduating from a university has gone through the same level of knowledge training. Why should one be given priority over the other? IF that is the case, the American Universities shouldn't be opened up to the global crowd. When one wants to make revenue out of tuition and fees, they should also give us the opportunity to atleast implement what we have learnt in the real world environment. and 2 years is an apt period for us to gain that experience. 

2. America is anyways deficit on the number of Software Professionals. So why not use the immigrants for the country's own benefit? (Its not like we take away anyones job. Infact, we have to work twice as hard as the localities to even stand a chance. ). This country has always appreciated knowledge and wiser people. So why not give the immigrants a chance to show their skill? Maybe we will all grow(as individuals and as a country). 

3. Also, OPT rule is itself applicable only for deserving individuals. If a candidate doesn't land himself a job within 3 months, he is anyways not eligible to stay in the country. So after all the filters applied, it is only the deserving lot that comes under this circle. So why not encourage them?
