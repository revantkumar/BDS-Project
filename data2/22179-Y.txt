I generally support the implementation of the new 24-month STEM OPT extension. It's such a boon for STEM OPT students, especially when the chance of winning H1b lottery is getting tremendously lower over the years. Moreover, it helps to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the US tech industries.

However, I believe the E-verify requirement associated with the new rules should be removed. It unfairly limits job options for STEM OPT students, as there are still plenty of major companies not willing to participate in the E-verify program. And with the new rules such as the New Mentoring and Training Plan, wage and compliance requirements that serve to more closely oversee the OPT extension program, the E-verify requirement is also becoming less and less important.

It seems to me the E-verify requirement in OPT regulations is more of an incentive USCIS offers to tempt more employers to enroll in it, while it turns out to be a burden for both STEM OPT students and employers. Personally, I've been suffering from that as a student on OPT extension.
