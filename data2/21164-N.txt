I think it would be a wonderful thing, if the U.S. Government, were to actually represent the American people for a change. The American people consist of citizens of this country. I thought I should put that in this letter, because it seems that the U.S. Government seems to believe it represents the people of the entire world. Is there any common sense left in Washington DC? Do any of the bureaucrats every spend any time outside of the Capital? The country is hurting for jobs that can actually afford to have you work for a full 40 hours, and pay a living wage again. There are many skilled people being put out of work by faceless people catering to special interest. How about the interest of American citizens?
