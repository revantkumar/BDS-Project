I am a STEM student in University. Frankly, I did not have any data to support my argument. However, one common difference between STEM major and other major is that students in STEM major need to have a long time for training before they can actually working in the company. In order to be fair with all students in the United Stated, STEM students are deserved to extend their OPT so that they can have the same opportunity as other students in different majors.
It is not related to the propensity of immigration, but the pursuit to have equal opportunity as students in other majors.
