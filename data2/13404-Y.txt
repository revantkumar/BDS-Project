OPT is a very important process for fresh graduates or graduate students to get experience before they get into the field
they are studying. OPT is also a important process for the employers to "test" out the graduates before they are hired for 
a permanent position. Right now due to the short time (12 month), a lot of intelligent people have to leave after they are 
proven due to the limited time. I strongly recommend to extend the OPT to 24month or longer
