I think STEM OPT extension is both good to the students with STEM majors and to the economic development of the United States, but the flip side is that this may exclude more H1B applicants whose major is not fell into STEM scale. For example, I am working for a state government as a performance auditor, and I am going to apply for H1B next April with my MPA degree. My employer spent lots of time on training me, and I believe my job involves lots of critical skills, but I only have less than 50% possibility (may be even less by counting in the number of applicants with STEM majors who were not selected in the previous couple of years)to stay and keep working for my employer. I don't want to individualize this situation, but there are some people working on things that directly benefit the national interests and involving research but not in a technically "governmental research institution" who will be squeezed out by a bunch of engineers. Don't get me wrong, I agree that people with STEM majors may contribute more to the country in general, but I would prefer to take some other people who can contribute to the national interest into the consideration of OPT extension, too.
