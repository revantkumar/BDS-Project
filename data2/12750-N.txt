This is completely maddening in the latest cynical, selfish move by a hostel Washington establishment hell bent on ruining the opportunities and job prospects of your average American. This has all the features of American dispossession and we've seen this for years and years a glaring and most recent example being Marco Rubio's recent h1b visa bill, which was to triple the number of h1b visas that would have put a stranglehold on your average STEM American workers increasing the total pool of stem labor in a limited labor pool in this country which was fortunately axed by "American's senator" Jeff Sessions whon injected some sanity into this ( Rubio's entire career involves shamelessly pandering to what appears to be primarily the whims and rewards of the Republican Jewish Coalition in people like Norman Braman, Sheldon Adelson, and Larry Ellison). The f1 non immigrant student visa increase and its concomitant exploitation by unscrupulous employers is yet another way for the cheap labor Lobby to continue to dispossess American workers and Americans have got to become angry about this and understand what this means, that there is no democracy it is been left in ashes and in its place can best be understood and has best been articulated by Sam Francis in his explanation of the classical model of elitism, plus hostile ethnic interests who don't represent the majority. This is dangerous and if we don't want America to repeat the final stage of the Roman Empire and implode we need to identify, protect, and honor the interest of the people who are already here legally. One nation, under God, indivisible.
