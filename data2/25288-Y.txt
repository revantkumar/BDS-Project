I'm not trying to give a strong comment, just a simple story happened around me. 
I work in a national lab, a year ago there was a fellow postdoc working in our group. She graduated in a top 3 university in China and got her Ph.D in Chemistry later in MIT. According to her, back when she just graduated, she did not think through whether to go industry or academia. During her late OPT time, she managed to find an company which would support H1B with requirement of her doing an internship for 6 months. Sadly, there wasn't enough time for her to finish the internship. She then joined our group and worked as a fellow postdoc researcher instead. After she finished her contract with the lab, she was hired by a top 5 university in China through the One Thousand Young Talents Program. She told me that working in China or U.S does not make much difference to her, she was sure that she would fit in well either way. 
She is one of the most driven, talented female researchers I've met. She has one paper published in the journal Science during the graduate school and many others in top journals. I was really happy for her because she found a job that she likes, meanwhile, this seems to be a loss to this country. This might just be an extreme case, but if the OPT time was longer, she could've stayed. Therefore, I do think this is necessary to extend the OPT time. Maybe just to increase the chance by a little bit for these smart, educated people to work for this country.
