To whom it may concern; 

By allowing foreign students to extend their visas from 12 to 36 months puts American students at a disadvantage when it comes to on the job experience. These students have received the best education available and have had 12 months to get on the job training. That should be enough to take home with them to further their prospects. We should be protecting our own students when it comes to on the job training and fostering an America first attitude where hiring is concerned. All too often these foreign students fail to return to their respective countries and end up as unlawful workers, stealing jobs that otherwise American students might have.
