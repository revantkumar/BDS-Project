There is a huge number of STEM students working at tech companies, who are contributing so much to the economy of the United States. If the OPT extension is canceled, there will be a tremendous loss to the America economy, every high-tech company in the States will be crying for more qualified and talented employees, and a major source is throttled by current visa policies. 

While, The expand of OPT extension will not only benefit the America economy, and all the high-tech companies, and STEM students ourselves, it will also contribute a lot to the development of the whole world. 

Please approve the new rule!
