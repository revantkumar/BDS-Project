The Optional Practical Training hiring of foreign nationals by the Department of Homeland Security is, of itself, a misnomer.
How can the Department of HOMELAND Security hire foreign nationals to defend the United States against foreign threats?
Not only does this make no sense, but it also takes jobs away from United States Citizens that are qualified to hold these positions, thus further damaging an already struggling economy.
We, the Citizens, are seeing far too much hiring of questionable individuals (foreign nationals whose nationality includes those countries that have declared the United States to be an enemy)simply because they will work for a lower wage. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!
Please consider the security of OUR country above the wishes of the current administration and their clear preferential treatment of Muslims over both United States citizens and Christians, keeping in mind that every American employed is one less on social services.
