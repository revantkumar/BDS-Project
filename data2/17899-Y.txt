This is such an great propose that benefit so much to both Native American and international students. I totally agree with it!

However, some people are trying to misleading citizens, they said this is unfair for Native American. But they didn't realized that those STEM students typically have a higher education level and useful skills, and you know who will they work for? The USA! The American Citizens! They studied for 20 years and hope to work for the country, why don't we approve them???
