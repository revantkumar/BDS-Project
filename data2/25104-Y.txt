I strongly agree that F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees should have an extended OPT period. Since applying for H1B is more competitive nowadays, people may not be able to get H1B visa at the first time. If these people are forced back to their home country because of this, it will have a negative effects on US scientific companies and thus US economy as a whole.
