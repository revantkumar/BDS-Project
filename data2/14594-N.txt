There is no reason to increase the amount of time that foreign workers can stay and work in this country. We are suppressing wages and importing competition for our own citizens in the technical fields. The only ones to benefit from this are the foreign workers who enjoy the improved employment opportunities and living conditions in the US and the companies that underpay foreign workers, leaving Americans to accept lower pay or work outside of their career fields. 

When American workers in these fields are fully employed we could talk about this. Until then we are hurting our citizens by doing so.
