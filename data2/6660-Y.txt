I am a Geophysics PhD student from Yale University, and an international student from China. I am writing this comment to support the decision of extending the STEM OPT period to 24 months, not only because it's in my own interest to do so, but more importantly it's also in American's interest. What makes America a great country? You might think democracy and freedom. Undeniably so. But is Europe less democratic or less free? I don't think so. IMHO, it's INNOVATION that really makes America great, and innovation is about people.

Yet as an international student, I've seen many smart people, truly smart people, who graduated from top universities in China and IVY leagues in the US, and wanted to start up their career here in the US, but was forced back to China due to visa limitations. It's such a pity to see them having to leave the US for visa problems, for myself personally and for the Americans, since they were such young and bright minds.

OPT extension is a critical step to help more smart people from all over the world and contribute their intelligence to the US, particularly in the STEM area. I hope this executive order will pass.
