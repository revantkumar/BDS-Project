Hongqi Zhu I really like and support this rule. 

The reason why people don't want to support this rule is because they don't understand the key point about this rule. 

This rule help USA to attract more and more talent students whom USA need. Will not the top 1 country, in the world, like the talent people. I don't think so. And also the population of a country is an important issue. If the USA want more population, the talent and international students are amazing option.
