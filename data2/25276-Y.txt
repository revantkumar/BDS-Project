1) I support the F1 OPT extension for STEM graduates. Increasing the OPT extension to 24 months from the current 17 months is mutually beneficial for the technology industry and the individual. International STEM Graduates have been the backbone of the technology industry in USA. 

2) I have never witnessed an American STEM graduate loosing job to an International STEM graduate. In fact American STEM students have more options to apply to jobs in government laboratories or industries which require only citizens or green card holders for the positions. 

3) The total visa slots are 20K + 65K but number of International STEM graduates has swelled up. People who do not get H1B will eventually have to return, but the OPT extension gives them a chance to be able to gain the crucial industry experience.

4) I work in a reputed electronics research company and I work in the field of computer engineering for mobile devices. My research helps in reducing power consumption in mobile devices such as tablets and phones which directly impacts the millions of consumers.
