I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates and many other American unemployed workers struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. These companies are un-American crony capitalists and should be dealt with accordingly. They certainly SHOULD NOT get any tax breaks at taxpayer expense to help them get FAT off American taxpayers.
