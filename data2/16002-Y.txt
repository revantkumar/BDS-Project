I personally have made use of this OPT facility. Now I work for a reputed US based MNC on work permit (H-1B). I am a staunch supporter of this OPT facility. I have a Masters degree from University of Wisconsin, Madison in engineering. This facility helps educated people work in US while their employment gets galvanized.I cannot think of a better way to attract and retain educated, talented and skilled workforce in US.
