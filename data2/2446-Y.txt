I agree with this extension rule. I am a engineering mgr in Bay area. I hire two new grad this year. Both are in OPT period, First of all I want to say, There are a lot of entry level engineer are in OPT period. They work hard and solve a lot of hard problems. They help senior engineer to implement product. So mgr and senior engineers can really focus on the product design and big pictures. I hope they can work a little long time for our company. Hiring and training new people really cost money and human resource.
