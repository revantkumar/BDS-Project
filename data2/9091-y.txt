Anne Berry International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. International students have become integral to the financial health of many US higher education institutions, but the impact goes beyond money spent on tuition fees and living expenses. International students also help promote a global learning environment. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow them to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting.
