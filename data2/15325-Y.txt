It is necessary for this extension to get approved for those talented foreign students who wants to use what they have learnt to contribute to the American society. International students are not illegal immigrants, and providing them chance to work will not kill America: I think this country is tougher and better than that. International students work very hard to finish their degrees and programs in American universities, and it is unjust to impose restrictions on them when they try to compete with local students to find a job. For a graduated foreign student, trying to obtaining a H1B working visa is like to win a monetary lottery. Without the extension, they only have one single chance to get an H1B visa, otherwise, they have to leave this country. I know many excellent graduates who already did a good job in their daily work and have to be forced out the country after one year's OPT. He/she lost a possible chance to fulfill his/her American dream, and the employer also lost an experienced employee: a lose-lose scenario. I recall that President Obama and many other wise Americans once said that an important part of this county's strength comes from its talented immigrants. If this country even shuts its door to those hard-working and well-educated people, how long before the idea of "all men are created equal" will tremble? That, my friend, is truly killing America.
