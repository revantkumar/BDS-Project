I think the rule will bring a win-win outcome for both US citizens and non-immigrants themselves.After the financial crisis in 2008, US is lack of economic momentum for many industries, especially for the high-tech industries, which require more and more high-tech labor resources to maintain its dominant role in the world in the face of the fierce competition from other rising countries. As most non-immigrant students are well-educated and elites of their own countries, with most of them focusing on the high-tech degrees. I believe the extension will bring high-quality IT human resources for the US and facilitate to boost US economy significantly.Therefore, I totally support the rule.
