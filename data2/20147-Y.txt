I obviously support the proposal.the proposal can play vital role for those students and also the American.
because of this, those students who accpeted the knowledge of US can make more contributions to US
Plus, it will promote the local economical development, like the IT industry. And the hight speed development of economy can provide more jobs for the local citizens and studnets. It is a good cycle and all of people can get benefit from it. 
Therefore I absolutely insist to support this proposal
