Alvaro Mendez USA is the only developed contry which does not offer working visa to foreign students. Let's put it this way, USA prepares them to be the best from the best and let them go to other developed contries to work and contribute for economic growth in contries like Canada, Australia, Germany, etc.
It doesn't make any sense !! Sounds crazy !! USA should keep them to contribute to America's growth.
They came, payed extra fees for studing here, have proven to be great citizens: they should stay and help progress .
