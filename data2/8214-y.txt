Deepshikha Singh I completely support the OPT extension for STEM field graduates. And here are my reasons for doing so. 

1. The committee that approves the admissions of international students is well qualified to filter out applications and admit only deserving applicants. This shows that admitted students are laborious people who have put 12+4 years of hard work to be what they are today. And they are smart too. Can a similar statement be made about majority of the american kids?

2. The statement that international students are stealing jobs of american people is utterly baseless. Why would companies hire an international student and spend money on his/her sponsorship when it can get an equally qualified American citizen for the same job? But do they actually get equally qualified citizens?

3. International people work hard, earn, pay taxes and spend their earnings here in United States. Can anyone say that this affects the US economy in a negative way? On the other hand if they have to go back, they'll try to save the last penny until their OPT expires take everything with them and go back home. Opposers to this rule can do the math and see what it's going to cost the United States. 

4. Lastly, does United States really want to admit smart international students, train them, spend on them and then send them back?
