I strongly support this new ruling. 

If students who are studying in the US all go back to their country after 1years of training, they will soon create value for their countries that will one day compete with the US companies. The US uses its own education to nurture its competitors? 

The fundamental reason for the extension to be 24 months is that a lot projects are 2~3 years long. It would be very much a trouble for companies to switch among different workers for the projects.
In summary, I think OPT extension is not a threat to the US and US citizens, but rather a benefit for exactly the US universities, companies, economy(and therefore for each individual.) Particularly, this very ruling is exactly out there to address people's concerns about abusing the OPT program and to make sure the OPT program will not become a drain for US jobs.
