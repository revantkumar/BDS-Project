I am positive about the proposal as it will help in maintaining leadership of the U.S. in research and latest technologies. OPT program has created jobs and prosperity for the US and this new proposal is welcoming as it will create an environment of leveraging the talent that only few other countries are fortunate to get. I strongly support the current proposal.
