Beth G From a manager perspective. I do agree with the proposal. To be fairly speaking, when I was in the recruiting process, I treat the STEM international students and American grad equally, there is no sense saying the Americans take away the jobs. what I am looking for is someone who is more suitable for the job, who is more competent, who is more experienced. We paid the same and there is no saying that because the cost for hiring international students is cheaper, besides, the company I works for is also a E-verify company, we need to pay the average salary to the employees.
