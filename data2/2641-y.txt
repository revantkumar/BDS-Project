Jessica Campbell International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership and quantitative skills. If this rule is not passed, foreign STEM grads will take their skills and education to their home countries, costing America the opportunity for job-creating innovation. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed. There will be adequate time for students to devote for the country where they studied several years..
