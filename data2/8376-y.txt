Diane Worthen I oppose Homeland Security's OPT program because it will reward foreign students, instead of American ones who train in the math, science and technology fields. And then, reward employers who hire them. This is taking jobs away from American people, forcing wages down, and can't be good for our country's security! 

Please oppose this ruling.
