Kevin Anderson International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 50% - from US$4.4 trillion in 2012 to US$6.2 trillion. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). STEM-related disciplines are responsible for many of the societal innovations that make our world better.
