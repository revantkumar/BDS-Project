I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
2.Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing.Working or creating a startup in my OPT duration is highly likely to bring about more job opportunities to American.
