The OPT policy and OPT extension has benefit America in both Economy and Science for many years. The reason that the US is the most powerful country in the world is her ability of attracting the most talented intelligence from the whole world. If the OPT or OPT extension could not be approved, it will hurt American's Economy and Science field very badly that the intelligence have to leave America and American people will lose their contribution to provide better and more affordable services in almost every field. I really hope every one lives in America will support this rule and continue benefit from it.
