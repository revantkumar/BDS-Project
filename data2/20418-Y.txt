My son works in IT, and has for both federal and state government (working for a contractor every time). I guess it's safe to assume that these contractors are being paid by the government to furnish. I also have two grandchildren going to college who could be buried in student loans and unable to find a job due to all the opportunities my government offers to foreign students. What is the solution?
