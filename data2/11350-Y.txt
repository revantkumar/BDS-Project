I do support this rule for the following reasons. 1. diversity built this nation, and this nation used to fight for diversity. 2. Yes, we have the best education system in the world, but we keep losing talent people all the time. If we looked at some famous achievements in recent days we will find that more and more of these are from countries other than US. I saw too many top F1 students from Stanford, Harvard, MIT... go back to their countries for better opportunities and more friendly work environment. I don't think it's wise to educate these talents and kick them out. 3. For those opposed voices, I understand they fear F1 students will take away their jobs. That's a selfish, shortsighted and even harmful thought. Good opportunities are only for those who qualify them. No one will take away any opportunities from talented people. US citizens already have so many privileges than F1 students, such as citizenship, language, social network, etc. If a citizen still complains that foreigners take away jobs, I guess he or she needs to work harder to get a job.
