Gabriella Russo I strongly support this new rule. I am an international student and when I decided to choose study abroad, I have multiple options: Canada, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, and United Kingdom. The reason I came to USA is that I have enough time to get industry training after graduation in US. I talked about this OPT extension rule with my mates and all the international student in my lab share the same opinion. I think OPT extension is very important to attract international STEM talents. Without the OPT extension, US will lose its attraction to international STEM talents which is a disaster to the academic world and high-tech companies.
