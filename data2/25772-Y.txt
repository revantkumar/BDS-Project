i totally support this proposal for several reasons. First, this expanded OPT proposal will attract more and more excellent STEM foreign student to contribute to this country in different kinds of fields. This will benefit Unites States greatly, both in economy and technology advancement. Second, As we all know diversity is a vital part of United states culture and it will provide different point of view to our society. So I support this proposal 100%. Thanks.
