I strongly support the 24 month extension of STEM OPT. 

Some of the opposing argument claim the STEM OPT is dragging down the U.S. economy. But this is very NOT true. One of the important reason for this STEM OPT extension is to ''help the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive, including by improving their ability to attract foreign STEM students to study in the United States.'' This group of talented labor force will make important contributions to the U.S. economy and academic sector. They have already start making contribution since paying large amount of tuition (way higher than local students' payments).

As said in the Action, "foreign students provide substantial benefits to their U.S. colleges and universities, including beneficial economic and cultural impacts".... 

"Current research also suggests that international students contribute to the overall economy by building global connections between their hometowns and U.S. host cities. Evidence links skilled migration to transnational business creation, trade,and direct investment between the United States and a migrant's country of origin."

I urge the anti group open their mind and think more about the big picture, the future of the U.S. economy. The STEM students deserve their respect. They deserve the opportunities for the 24 months extension.
