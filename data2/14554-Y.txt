I strongly support OPT extension.

Diversity is a advantage of USA. Talented international students have been one of the sources of U.S. fastest growth and countries who refuse to embrace talents, skills, and beneficial competition have been experiencing much slower growth.

The extension is ONLY for STEM students, not for all international students. U.S. needs more talents.
