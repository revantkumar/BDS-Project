I strongly support this rule for the following reasons. Firstly, America is a multi-culture country, which means that people from every other country are welcome here. That is, job opportunities should be the same. If this rule is enforced by the government, international students will create more and more unexpected benefits. Secondly, that this rule is established also shows that freedom and equal right are really implemented in USA. Thirdly, it just indicates the benefits to international students apparently, but it actually brings the most benefits to residents in America, not only economically but also culturally. All in all, I really strongly support this rule!
