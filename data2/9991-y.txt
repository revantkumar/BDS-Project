Cole Peter I actively support this new OPT extension rule.It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students.

STEM OPT extension helps to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally.The global talents needs US as a platform to show and contribute what they have, on the other way, Us also need these great young man to payback and contribute to the nation after they are educated from universities. 

OPT-extension is also beneficial for firms in US. 12-months seems not enough for international students to gain enough work experience. Many firms takes serval month training fresh graduates, and then only found that these new hired just work a few months and sent back to serve their countries. Firms suffers from cost of recruiting and training well prepared employees and also lost potential competitive powers or even future leaders, which will definitely a long term loss to firms and US economy. 

In addition, I believe U.S. employers will benefit from the knowledge, not only professional skills, but also customs and markets of other countries from STEM OPT students, giving U.S. a jump on its foreign rivals in getting new products to market fast. Firms like Uber China Growth team and TripAdvisor China team will surely need to know more about local market. If these companies expands, like Uber, they will produce more work opportunities for people in the US.

Above all, I definitely support the Extension of OPT. What a single student can gain is not the key, compared with what the nation will benefit in such a policy. No matter in longterm or short term, US will be the biggest winner and OPT extension always is serves as a wise decision for US future.
