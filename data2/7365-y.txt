Qichen Wang I strongly support this proposal.
It has benefits for both USA and individuals.
1. With more talented stem graduates, it will strongly support technology industry, and boost all the other industries related, increasing economy an people's life.
2. It attracts more excellent students all around the world, and increase America's competition. Education will be greatly effected with more professional people, and with higher standard level, more outstanding american will be educated.
3. When international graduates start to work, more wealthy is generated, and the country can have more tax income, more american can benefit from this.
4. People will have more choices. It's a misunderstanding that the competition causes losing jobs for american, frankly, it generates more job opportunities. Most stem graduates work in tech, IT... industries, which needs a lot of engineers every year. The demand is larger than supply, in these industries, both american and international students can get job. And the companies in IT, tech... connects with other industries, and generates new chances for lots of American.
5. American dream, drives people all around the world to apply their knowledge and perspiration to success. With the freedom and fairness, this proposal gives a proper chance to United States and all the American to achieve the dream.
