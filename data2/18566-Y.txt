I personally support this proposal for extending the OPT for F-1 students. This is very good action to attract more talented students and professionals to stay and work in the U.S. Today, More than enough technicians are needed in the fields, such as computer science, electrical engineering, chemistry, biology and so on. Most of STEM degrees are related to the above fields. Having more people who have expertise in those fields work and contribute for America could definitely benefits the economy and relevant industries. This can also create more working opportunities for American society. So it's a right thing to increasing the chance for F-1 students to stay by extending the OPT for eligible major listed in STEM degree.
