I am really exited to see this new OPT extension rule and I consider it as a good benefit for US and high-tech employees. 

1. It gives US a good chance to attract many understanding international students. 
With this new rule, more and more international students will like to study at US, not only for good quality education but also for the the good opportunity to work US for about 3 years to accumulate more experiences. And those outstanding international students with advanced degree definitely will make huge contribution to US. 

2. I am grateful to see that US government has paid attention to this OPT extension issue when plenty of international students ask for help. It also shows that US is a country that is willing to people's voices, even they are just international students studying in US. I am really impressed by US's belief in equality and their effort to make sure a balanced and reasonable rule. 

Thanks to those who help to build a US with equality and diversity.
