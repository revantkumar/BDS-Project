I strongly SUPPORT the proposal, mainly from the following reasons:
1. Students who comes from the STEM major are usually high - tech talent, who could make great contribution to the USA even to the whole world, if America values these people, they should find a way to keep them stay. Not only would they help promote the economic growth of America, but also increase the influence of america in the world.

2. Extend the OPT doest mean that there would be less opportunity for the american people. People should think about themselves instead of other external factors when they can't find a job. With the competition from the international student, the american student would work more hard to get the job they want, and therefore strengthen the quality of education. 

3. Also, without the support of opt, the number of students would decrease sharply in the coming years, which would bring huge impact on the economy of the america.
