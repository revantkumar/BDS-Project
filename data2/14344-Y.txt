I abdolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT for the following reasons. 
Firstly, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. US technology companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here.
Secondly, diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. The United States now is a multi-race country. So the voice from other race people, such as Asian and European, is essential. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices.
And the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings.
