I am strongly supportive of this rule. Companies provide job opportunity to candidates based on talents, because truth is hiring cost of a foreigner is actually higher than that of a US citizen, with regards to fees on OPT extension application, etc. Why would a company want to spend a little more to hire foreign students over a domestic candidates? Only because a company sees he or she has (much) better skills to compensation the extra overhead. Cancellation of OPT extension means STEM companies will be forced to not hire certain foreigner student, not because they are not qualified, but because they lack working right. What does it mean? It effectively means COMPANIES WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HIRE PEOPLE THAT THEY OTHERWISE WERE NOT WIlLING TO HIRE. Is that really a good thing to U.S. economy?

America has arguably the best educational institution in the world, and the most successful American businesses hire the best of the best, regardless of place of birth, because they believe in talents and merits and through this they obtain their prestigious reputation. It is the same idea behind which the best schools will offer opportunities to every talent regardless of ones richness or poorness, ones race or ethnicity. It is upon this that the greatness of this nation is built on. 

Another factor to note, tuition from international students has become one of the major income for some US universities. cancellation of OPT extension will definitely drive international students away from applying to US universities, they might otherwise prefer schools in UK / Canada where the policies are more welcoming, which effectively affects US colleges - especially public ones.
