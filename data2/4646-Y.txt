I SUPPORT this proposal, as a international computer science student, I hope that I can at least have a chance to earn my tuition fee back during my OPT... And why the citizens afraid of a 3 year work permission? It's not a big difference than 1 year, it's temporary. And we do need that. 
The extension has been 17 month for years, why they say making it 24 month a drawback? US doesn't need to behave like Europe. It's a waste of human resource when you educate so many people and kick them back where they come from only after 1 year.
