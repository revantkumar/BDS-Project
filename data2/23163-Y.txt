This new rule is a win-win situation for all the parties involved. The earlier rule was only vacated because it was defective. This is a perfect opportunity to fix it. The U.S needs an increasing number of STEM graduates every year and fixing this rule will go a long way in improving the situation for the STEM graduates and the firms. I support this new rule wholeheartedly.
