America does NOT have the resources to increase foreign workers/working here in America. To increase the number of foreign workers or the length of time that non-citizen's can work is utterly asinine. The job of the Federal Government is to look out for the best interests of AMERICANS, NOT FORIEGNERS! Do your job the way you are supposed to do your job. Your job is to build up and defend America, not piss it away like last nights beer!
