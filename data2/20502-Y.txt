I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1 IT industry contribute more than 25% of GDP in U.S. Most of international students go to IT industry after graduation, which can significantly improve the economy of us. 

2 Students who can to U.S and enroll universities and earn STEM degree are most talented people in the world. Obviously, if the talented people work in U.S, it will help the country to keep the leader position of the world. 

3 Many projects in industy will need more than 24 months. Short OPT will effect the progress of project,since company may need to find new people to instead the one who can not keep working due to termination of OPT.
