karthik reddy mandadi I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. Also it does not matter on which field is student is going to do the job regardless of his major field.
