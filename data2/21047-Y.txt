I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. Because the new extension of STEM OPT will significantly improve the technology industries in the US, thus contributing the power of the US in a more general perspective. The US employment data are better than ever, so we should not worry too much about the positions occupied by these students. After all, they only take technological positions and these jobs are still in great need of talented professionals. Moreover, it is just about the extension of STEM OPT, but not about H1B visa. If the number of H1B visas does not increase, it will not affect the jobs for US citizens.
