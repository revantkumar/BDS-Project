I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. 

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many international students did not compete with local citizens, they did kinds of jobs that some Americans were not qualified for. Competitions make improvement. It is international students help the U.S. market to select better workers, to improve the average levels of people.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Without these excellent foreigners, the U.S. would have little chance to communicate with foreign countries and foreign culture.
