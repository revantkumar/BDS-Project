I am a postdoc in a public university in the midwest of America. I take my 17-month STEM opportunity right now after my 1-year OPT period ended in June, 2015. Many of my friends are also benefied by OPT-extension as scientific researchers. Therefore, I highly support the STEM as a long-standing regulation for the future students in these areas in the United States for the reason as followed:

1. STEM studies are hard and it takes more than one year of practice. This is a fact. It always requires years of training and long term practice even after school. For example, considering the major contributor of STEM research-the postdocs, many of them start their postdoc training using OPT. And, one year is not enough at all for many studies to finish, especially for the biomedical researches. There are other jobs, such as patent lawyers, counsalting, community college or high school teacher, proposal manager, facility manager and so on, all of them require many techiniques that can only be learnt as an entry level worker for more than a year. 

2. The job market, on the other hand, is not that easy correspondingly. I guess it is a nature for getting a tenure track faculty job as difficult as it should be, other company based scientist jobs are also becoming harder and harder to get based on my experience-considering the time it takes to prepare the job applicatioin, several rounds of interviews, and so on. Again, one year OPT does not provide any flexiblity for the highly educated students to realize the transition to fully prepared emplyees, not to mention that many International students have extra difficulties to find the company who would like to sponsor their H1B visa. 

In sum, I think that 24-month STEM can be a good opportunity for all the students who can learn in the US, can work for the US, and can fully contribute their values to the US.
