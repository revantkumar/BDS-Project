Alan Yueh The OPT program is being mis-used by American business to not only get around the H1-B visa quotas, but also to avoid hiring American engineers and STEM workers. I have seen my wages stagnate for almost a decade despite being a software engineer with two engineering degrees -- undergraduate from MIT and a Master's degree from U. of Southern California.

While there are American businesses who are playing by the rules and are hiring Americans, many others are either using the OPT program to hire cheaper labor (depressing wages), and this forces other businesses to do the same to stay competitive.

At this point, we are close to having this attitude of "hire cheapest first" become institutionalized and a part of the American business culture. That is, what once was over-the-line became "grey" and has continued to move toward becoming acceptable and normal business practice.

Consequently, this program needs to be "tightened up" (or stopped) to protect American STEM workers.

Thank you for your time.
