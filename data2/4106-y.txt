Larry Allen This DHS proposed rule will result in taking jobs that American college students desperately need. If the U.S. really "needs" foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? And more importantly, if workers with such training are needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? There is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.

There is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates. U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather than an American college grad with the same skills and the same salary. And by defining a recent college grad as a student, the DHS takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes (FICA and Medicare taxes) -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The OPT workers will cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. The real intent of this rule was defined by Senator Charles Grassley in a letter to Obama: "By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."
