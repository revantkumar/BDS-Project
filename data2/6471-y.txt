Tao Zhang I strongly support this rule because the U.S. is now short on STEM workers. Wages have grown relatively faster in STEM-oriented occupations, which clearly indicates a shortage. Jonathan Rothwell, a reporter in the U.S.News, showed that from 2000 to 2013, analyzing Bureau of Labor Statistics data and adjusting for inflation, median salaries for workers in computer and mathematical, health care practitioner, engineering, and science occupations rose 8 percent, 7 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent respectively, even as those for the average U.S. worker showed no growth. Software developers, for instance, saw salaries soar 26 percent over the same period, culminating in an average of $82,000 in 2013, up from $48,000 in 1980. More broadly, an analysis he completed earlier this summer for the Brookings Institution of census data showed a large relative increase in the STEM earnings premium about 60 percent from 1980 to 2012, controlling for education, experience and gender. In addition, vacancies for STEM jobs are going unfilled in large numbers. Jonathan's recent report analyzes this phenomenon using a rich database with millions of vacancies posted on company websites compiled by Burning Glass, a labor market analytics firm. There are some 40,000 computer science bachelors degree earners each year but roughly 4 million job vacancies for computer workers. In all, the median duration of advertising for STEM vacancies is more than twice that of those in other fields. According to Jonathan's opinion, jobs are more plentiful in STEM fields, which is why the unemployment rates are low for grads with these degrees. According to the Conference Board, there are currently three job vacancies advertised online for every unemployed computer worker; by contrast, there are more than six unemployed construction workers per vacancy. Therefore, this rule can effectively relieve the shortage of STEM workers in the U.S.
