I believe anything that creates more foreign workers in our country whether they be students or immigrants is not a good idea because these kind of workers have been shown to take jobs away from American citizens. Our citizens are being fired and replaced by these foreign workers and in many cases our citizens have to train these foreigners who are taking their jobs, all because the foreign workers are paid less. This is terrible for American workers and drives wages down and unemployment up. It is getting harder and harder to obtain a good paying job in our country and our government apparently wants to make it even harder!!
