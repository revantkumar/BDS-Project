No. Period. There are too many AMERICAN'S who need these jobs. American people are tired of seeing our jobs being bid out to overseas slave labor/sweat shops or are being taken from us here in the states by businesses bringing in foreign worker's who will take less money for the jobs offered, or worse hiring ILLEGALS OVER AMERICANS WHO HAVE THE SKILLS FOR THE JOBS. American's cannot take these jobs for what they are willing to pay these Visa holders or these illegals and it must stop.
No amount of statistical figures that are put forth are going to allay the frustrations that American citizens feel.
