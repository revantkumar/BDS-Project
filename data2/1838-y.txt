Prabhudev Konana As a researchers and an educator in a premier institution, I find there is incredible demand for Master's and PhD students doing business analytics, Management/computer information systems, Computer Science, and engineering disciplines. Unfortunately a significant number of applicants are foreign students in these disciplines. From my experience these students studying in US universities are highly qualified and employers like them. However, given the difficulty of securing H-1B or longer OPT, they hesitate to hire foreign students with advanced degrees. The lack of available talent is forcing few companies to expand outside the United States. Having done research on global sourcing, it is evident that a large number of hi-tech firms are expanding in India, China, Eastern Europe, Canada, etc rather than expanding in the U.S. The 24-months additional OPT will help companies and our economy.
