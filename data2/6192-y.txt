Lori Hanegraaf The current STEM list: http://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2014/stem-list.pdf
Excludes the CIP codes for our professionals at Northwestern Health Sciences University - which limit 
them to 12 months of OPT. We would like to have CIP codes added for Chiropractic and Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine 
so they can be STEM approved and be extended for 24 months of OPT. F-1 students ask about the STEM program so there 
is interest. Thank you for your consideration.
