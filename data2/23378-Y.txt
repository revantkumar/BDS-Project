The government should legitimate the proposed extension for the country's own benefit. United States is a country that welcomes diversity and values talented and skilled people. Without OPT, its extension and cap gap, foreign students will have no choice but leave the country upon graduation. The country has spent large amount of money and resources educating foreign students. What's the point of this investment if you just let them go without them contributing to the country's economy? These foreign students excel in science and technology. They have already made and will make great contributions to the country's economy. Without extension and cap gap, the high tech companies will bear huge amount of loss.

Please make the right move and do the needful.
