Actually I highly support this extension of OPT.

Maybe some people will think jobs are limited and they will loss jobs If more foreign students can work in the US. Absolutely it is true, foreign 
students take jobs. But on the other side, it will also create job opportunities, such as
1) more consumers opportunities and more supply service needed 
2) US will have the geniuses all over the world and they will make great contribution to the US
