Yichao Yang The extension of OPT for STEM students are very helpful for American economy.

1. The extension of OPT DOES NOT decrease the job opportunity for native Americans. In this time the extension of OPT is only available for STEM student.Based on the statistics of American education association, there is a huge gap between the demanding from the industry related to STEM and students. It means the STEM students are not enough to work in these areas. In other aspect the demand from STEM related jobs will increase about 60%. Therefore, the extension of OPT will not decrease the job opportunity, otherwise it will provide qualified and highly educated people to work in this area, promote the STEM related economy, and then boost the economic development in America.

2. Whether the OPT is extended or not, it will not influence the unemployed population. The reason is that unemployment population is made up of labor-intensive blue-collar workers and veterans. The major reason for the unemployed workers is the industrial upgrading and the elimination of outdated production capacity. Even though OPT cannot be extended, the unemployed population cannot find jobs from STEM-related companies. So there is no relationship between the extension of OPT and unemployed population.
