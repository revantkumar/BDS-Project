*The new rule should be implemented by Jan 2016 (before the 12 Feb 2016) 
deadline by the court.
*To maximize USA economy growth ,USA needed large work force.
*According to 2014 NAFSA findings, 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges
across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S economy during the 2013-2014 academic year. 
This is a 8.5% increase in job support and creation, and a nearly 12% increase in dollars contributed to the economy from the previous academic year.
*International students not only contribute economic value, they build bridges between the United States and other countries, bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs.
*Welcome the new proposals and without this ,the students will leave the US and there will be brain drain and students will be losing the touch on the Stem degree advancements and experience.
*The employers will be getting the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT.
