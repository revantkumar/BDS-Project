OPT 24-months extension will undoubtedly benefit US economy. Science and Technology are the fundamental sources for economy growth. Numerous STEM students will have the opportunities to contribute to the progress of science and technology in the United States. In the long run, more job opportunities will be created in all areas surrounding STEM field. 

Also, as we know, winning a H1b lottery is getting more and more difficult over the years. I've seen too many brilliant students graduated from TOP universities like Stanford, MIT have to go back to their country because of losing the H1B lottery. For all the time, United States is a land of great opportunities for those who have talents and can contribute to the society. We call it American dreams. Without OPT STEM extension, more than TWO THIRDS of STEM students have to leave this country. Some of them may become the future Einstein, Von Karman, and other thousands of thousands of who can make great contributions to the United States. OPT 24-month STEM extension will dramatically increase the chance to keep those smart brains in this country. And US will benefit from this rule in the long run.
