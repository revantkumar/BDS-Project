Tushar Anand I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because every student deserves to have enough time-period to apply the skills that he or she learnt in the school and be given a chance to possibly live the american dream. A nation is what its people make it and therefore no immigration policy should hinder the growth of the people who make America the greatest country in the world.
