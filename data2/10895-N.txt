I oppose this rule because of the negative and detrimental ramifications to America's own college graduates and Social Security. Our college graduates will need jobs which will not be available if this rule is put in place. They deserve the first opportunity to be hired instead of foreign students. Companies should not be allowed to circumvent paying payroll taxes in order to pad their bottom line.
