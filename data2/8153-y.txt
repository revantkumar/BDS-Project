Yiwang Zhou I strongly support the approval of this new resolution. This can help the graduated student with stem degrees to gain working experiences in United States, which will definitely benefit them a lot to their career life. In addition, the increasing number of students staying here to work for some time will help strengthen the relationship between the companies between USA and the other countries. As is known to all, communication and collaboration between countries is an irresistible trend in the modern society. At last, I believe that there is a lot of demand of qualified students to work in order to help the development of the States. So in a word, I think this will be very beneficial.
