It is surprising that someone would oppose to the idea of extending OPT for STEM students, arguing that they are stealing jobs from the US citizens. These students came to the US for higher level education, that is post graduate. Their education, from elementary school to college, were funded by foreign nations, which is normally called intelligence drain for these foreign countries. By allowing them to work in the US and ultimately nationalize them, the US is benefiting enormously! They work and pay taxes to the US, fulfilled their share of duty to the US government, why shouldn't they seek compensation in the form of a better work and research environment that is unavailable in the country that they were born?! There are so many homeless people on the street holdig a US citizen status. Illegal immigrants came into the US and gave birth to children that automatically became US citizens. How much could these Citizens contribute to the US? They may very well benefit from the tax money paid by people working under OPT status. United States is a place that fosters competition, as can be seen from its competition/antitrust law. The absurd idea that foreign intelligence will steal job from US people is a reflection of the insecurity from the less competent.
