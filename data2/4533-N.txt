First, workers and their employers are NOT exempt from payroll taxes. They don't need to pay Social Security and Medicare, which also means they don't have the access to these benefits in the future. You can do the math, however, I don't think there are enough Americans qualified for the jobs OPT granted. OPT requires the students work in the fields related to their studies. Given the educational background, they hold at least bachelor degrees in STEM area.

To your point, it creates a bridge to an H-1B tech-worker visa and eventual employment-based green cards. As a country, US try to attract talented people to work or even join the country. It won't hurt Americans, if US could get stronger with these talented people. There are other strict processes in applying H-1B and green cards as well. For instance, the prevailing wage has to be met in H-1B authorizations. 

I agree the OPT program was also designed to allow foreign students to gain work experience in their field of study that would help them find work when they return to their home countries. On the other hand, it also provide more educated work forces for the US. We all agree the changes in the world in recent decades are in STEM areas. To be the leading/best country, you have to be competitive. You can see the immigration changes in Europe when there are not enough young people. We are experiencing the similar thing. By simply stopping OPT, there will be jobs no one can do instead of all filled by Americans.
