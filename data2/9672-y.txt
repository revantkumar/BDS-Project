Badrinath Bhalkiker This is in regards the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate student at the State University of New York at Binghamton[SUNY - Binghamton]. Majority of graduate students at SUNY - Binghamton are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. 

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I am particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.With this proposed rule my experience in the Tech field allows me to gain practical knowledge and thus OPT and OPT extension is important to me.

I am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule-making process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I thank for the opportunity give to me to comment on this proposed rule.

Sincerely,

Badrinath Bhalkiker
