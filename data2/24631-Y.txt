To Whomsoever it may concern 

I am an International Student in Illinois Institute of Technology. I will be graduating in December 2015 and I plan to start the OPT program. Every company I have been talking to about my OPT is very hesitant to give me a Job because of the eventual sponsorship for the H1-B visa requirement. If this was to pass then that would help me with any job process because of the time that I'm authorized to work under the OPT would perfectly be long enough that a company will find me very valuable and would get me sponsored for the H1-B
