I am an engineering student at Iowa State University whose family immigrated here to the United States in order to find a better life. I am the 5th generation of a line of farmers, mechanics, physicists, and engineers who have lived here. 

Many of my friends here at Iowa State are international students in STEM programs. They have dreamed of living in the United States and want to raise a family here. They love the freedom to think for themselves, the freedom to make a living without worrying about corrupt officials shutting them down, they love the safety. Isn't that why our families came here? Why they stayed? How then can we refuse that opportunity to others.

One of my friends worked as a statistician for the Iowa Department of Education, she loved her job, and her employers loved her, but because her OPT expired and she couldn't renew they had to let her go. She found another job but had the same problem after her OPT ran out again. Now she is back in school again, not because she didn't enjoy what she did before, but because she hopes it will give her the best chance to stay here. 

Another friend is a project manager from southern China. He loves democracy and is passionate about telling his friends and anyone who will listen about the abuses of power committed by his government. Because of this he has been blocked on social media. His OPT is also running out and is out of options. He will most likely need to go home.

Why do we place so many stumbling blocks to those who would benefit our country the most? The current systems makes them feel trapped and constantly worried about the future. I support the 24 month extension and urge my representatives to make this investment in the future of our country and reform the system.
