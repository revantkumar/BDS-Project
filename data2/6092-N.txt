I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 

According to Numbers USA, "OPT is not some obscure program that bends the rules for a few highly-qualified foreign
students. According to the Government Accountability Office, about 100,000 foreign graduates a year are awarded 
OPT status (about 20,000 with the STEM extension) and then go on to compete with similarly qualified American job seekers. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, the Center for Immigration Studies confirmed these numbers, finding that 497,274 OPT work authorizations were granted by DHS between 2009 and 2013, and that $4 billion of potential contributions to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds were lost. Even some who believe that OPT began with good intentions question its legality, and do not dispute that it is harmful to American workers. Daniel Costa of the Economic Policy Institute argues that the OPT results in "lower wages by increasing the number of underpaid and exploited foreign workers in the [tech] industry.

This is wrong.
