Why Amercan would like the best students to work for other countries? Many STEM students earned the schalorships to come to America. America spent a lot of money to attract the best students from all of the world. And then what? Send them back to serve other countries? 

Good students are the next generation to improve the economy. No matter where do they from. Send good students to other country won't save job market in America. On the contrast, America may become weak in the worldwide competition and loose job opportunities for their own people. Why do all the best students would like to leave their home and families to come to America? Because they believe here are the opportunies! Where does the opportunity come from? From those who immigrated to America with their wisdom and knowledges in the past two hundreds of years. 

If America refuses good students, then there will be another America, where those students move to.
