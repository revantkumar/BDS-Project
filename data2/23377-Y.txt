I strongly support the rule.

First, the policy promotes US economy growth. International students from China contribute more than 2000 billion dollars to US economy every year. However, without the OPT extension which is an important part of degree pursue process, a large proportion of international students would choose not to come to US for education and it would be a huge economy loss.

In addition, since fewer and fewer American students choose STEM as their major, the number of American students alone can not meet the needs of technical companies' hiring head counts. Therefore, it is not likely that OPT extension could "steal" American's working opportunities. On the other hand, with the policy cancellation would comes the lack of technical employees which would harm big tech companies' development.

Furthermore, everyone should be given equal opportunities, especially those talented students who come to USA for better education opportunity deserve more time to practice their skills after graduation.
