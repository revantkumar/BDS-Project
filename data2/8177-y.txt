Wei Zeng I strongly believe that this regulation will benefit U.S economy which leads to global economy for the following reasons:
1. International technicians or labors are outstanding and hard working in STEM field, which makes native citizens feel threatened. I don't think the threaten is a bad thing, on the contrast, the threaten may encourage both international technicians and native citizens to be competitive, which will stimulate the current economy.
2. The extension is not about international students taking native citizens' job positions. Some people who are complaining about not having a good job are not even in the STEM field. And people who are in the STEM field don't have a good job is not because someone from a far eastern country take theirs, it is because they are not that good. Instead of complaining, why not work hard? If the government leans to "regulate" for people who are blaming everything to international students who have much less opportunity and the government who does everything to support the country, that will be unfortunate. 
3. U.S has the most advanced technology and resource in the world, which not only makes the country powerful and also responsible. Due to the globalization, talented students from all over the world come here to make their contribution to science, economy, technology. They are here not because they want to take some native citizens' jobs. They are here because of the urge to witness and also change the world in a good way. 
4. I am studying math in a grad school of U.S. My classmates are great and talented, and they don't complain the extension. Science has no board lines. U.S has became the most powerful country is because they took all the scientist in when Germans gave them away during World War 2. How about now, extending a couple of months leads to such a big deal.
I don't see why this brings so many negatives thoughts to some people.
