OPT Extension does help US industry, American Tech companies, and engineering community. US has invested on these folks during their school time. Most of these students had tuition fee waiver up to 30 grant a year during their graduate programs. Forcing them to leave after their graduation means the money we have invested on them had no benefit for our country. As an American citizen, I strongly support the new rule of OPT extension.
