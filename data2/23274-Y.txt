Extension of OPT program would benefit both the united states and us as the STEM students. Three years extension would allow company to evaluate their potential staff more thoroughly, and make a more comprehensive decision on whether sponsoring him/her. The extension would also give STEM students more opportunities to exhibit our talent and ability. This would give us the time to find the career path that we belong to. In other words, it will bring more value to both US economy and technology development.
