Until now there're more than 3 million international students who graduated and had been working in United States using their OPT or H1B visa. I STRONGLY AGREE with the rule of 24-month OPT extension. These international students paid very high tuitions to American education and they mainly work in STEM field which highly drive US economy and contribute a lot to US's leadership in the world. It's not fair to ask international students to accept low salaries considering they spent so much in their education. They deserve to have what they expect. They earn a lot and they pay a lot of tax, which greatly improve US economy. Also, their hardworking will cheer American colleagues to work harder and harder, which is exactly what American Dream is about: work hard and have what you want!
