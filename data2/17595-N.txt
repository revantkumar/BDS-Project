Our children deserve the education and possible jobs as all other Americans. To deny these children the same opportunity that the president and all our politicians have had is just wrong and you know it. You must stand with American citizens or consider yourselves traitors by the majority of Americans. 

Why the hatred against American citizens and this is what is happening, you talk about racist well by denying all Americans the chance of an education and jobs in America you are now showing the hatred against the American citizens. Why is it necessary to deny Americans the right to jobs, you stand with all illegals throughout the world and it looks like to me and many others that you are trying to replace the American citizens with other people in the world. You are destroying this country and we will fight back.
