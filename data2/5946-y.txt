Xingcheng Huang I think OPT extension should at least be maintained as 17 months because most software/research projects last more than two years, if those STEM students lose visa during this procedure, their research may fail and the cost of restarting those procedures might be higher than making them continue working on it. It's not economic and it wastes a lot of research fund.And most stem students are high-educated talents with proficient technical skills like programming and designing. They are the talents who can contribute a lot to american's economic growth and they have the ability to start up enterprises in the future which produces more job opportunities for all american people. Losing those people and making them go back to american's competitors is not a smart choice.
