Corporate welfare in, and of, itself is wrong costing American taxpayers many millions of dollars. But expanding F-1 
opportunities at the expense of Americans losing even more jobs at a time when more Americans are unemployed 
than ever before is completely unacceptable. Stop big business and their lobbyists from taking even more control from
the American people. Say NO to expanding opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With Stem Degrees and
CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.
