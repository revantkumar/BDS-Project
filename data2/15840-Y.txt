I believe the 24 months OPT extension will have a lot of advantages for millions of students and people who intend to pursue advanced education in USA from abroad. They could use their talents and technique shills to make huge fortune for United States economics.It makes positive effects on economics in United States of America. 
I strongly recommend 24 months extensions for STEM students is a necessary and wise rule. Also, the amount of H1B for F1 students should increase relatively in order to keep the probability of F1 students get H1B visa every year.
