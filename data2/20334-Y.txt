I have a PhD degree and I have stayed in U.S. For 8 years. But I still can not get a legal status in this country. I spent all my youth here in this country, learn hard, work hard. After so many years here, I don't even get a chance to stay here and get a job. Now I have to leave the country if the OPT expires. That's does. It make any sense. I believe I am half American now. I can not understand why the government does not allow many legal immigrants with high degree and can contribute a lot to this country to stay.

U.S. Government is ruining this country if they do not keep the international students to stay.
