I strongly support the extension of OPT.
Every job is obtained through fair competition between applicants, so the OPT extension will also not harm the opportunities for American students.
Some talented students needs enough time to gain enough working experience and really stand out. If the OPT period is extended, it may help the US to keep those good employees, so ultimately, this extension is beneficial to the society.
