I STRONGLY support the proposal.

As a foreign student, the most important reason to study in the U.S. is that we can learn advanced knowledge and also have the change to get work experience in top companies in the world. One year is simply not enough. The number of foreign students will dramatically decrease if there is no extension. U.S. schools will suffer a lot given that we pay a lot of tuition. Besides, the diversity will also decrease, which will hurt the creativity of the U.S. nation.

In addition, we generate a lot revenue for the U.S. companies and we also pay tax. Both of them make the U.S. great!
