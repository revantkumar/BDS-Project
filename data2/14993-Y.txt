I support this extension. The extension shows this country's confidence and openness, which makes America the greatest country in the world.

This policy makes our country young and competitive. We shall never forget that the greatest people emerged under the greatest environment of freedom and competition, which was the spirits of this country. 

The extension won't lead to increase of jobs, but lead to a blooming of them otherwise. The incoming of the foreign students will surge the demand for consumption, leading to an increasing economy. Those incoming students need food, clothes, houses, which all bring potential job demands.

So all in all, I support OPT extension. God bless America.
