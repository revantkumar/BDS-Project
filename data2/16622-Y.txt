Strongly Support. This rule only allows US companies fully utilize foreign students' talent. Once it is suspended, related companies will suffer great lost. It does NOT give foreign students any advantage over citizens. Actually, US students rarely study in STEM majors, engineering and IT companies dont have other choice but hire foreign students.
The cancellation of this rule will make foreign students no longer come to US. Their tuition is one of the most important fund sources for universities. They also bring a lot of job chances, such as house rental and auto sale.
