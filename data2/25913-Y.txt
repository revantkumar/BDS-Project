I think expanding OPT for F-1 students is beneficial to the nation. 

First, this policy can help employers to find more qualified employees. There are lot of academic areas, such as electrical engineering, computer engineering, in which international students are playing vital roles both in industry and academic. Expanding OPT gives employers more opportunity to find, train, evaluate their employees.

Second, this policy brings more international travelers to US. As far as I know, the expiration time for travel visa for Chinese has been expanded to 10 years recently. The family of F-1 students in China come to visit them more frequently due to this visa's convenience. The international traveler brings US a lot money and employment opportunitIES each year. If the OPT is expanded, the family of F-1 student have a big chance to visit them in the expanded time (probability the last year the student stays in US).
