Carl Liang 1.Nowadays, US has an urgent need in technical personnel to work for technical companies. But there are not enough US citizens workers for them to hire. International tech workers can help these companies solve these problems. And OPT extension is a guarantee for students who are in STEM majors to satisfy their needs. If OPT remains on one year, then there won't be many international tech workers coming to work for US tech companies. 
2.OPT Extension is also an essential way to attract more talents from other countries to study STEM majors in the United States. Because the students in these majors can obtain more opportunities and longer time to practice their skills in tech corporations before coming back. It is a benefit for both the school and the company.
So, I am agree with extending the STEM OPT period by 24 months.
