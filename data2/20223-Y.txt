I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons

1. Diversity is what made the U.S we loved, we all agree that U.S. is a country which can make dreams come true, I don't want to see 'is ' change into 'was'. 
2. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. TO consider in the long term, students from overseas are who make ace in their in their country, American need the elite to keep its strongest state in the world.
