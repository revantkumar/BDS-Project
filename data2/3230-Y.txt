I support this extension of OPT.

As more and more students came and studied in America since 2008 recession, and increasing corresponding infrastructures were built in the past years and will be built in the future. If those students leave because of policy problem, who will come to consume this investment? For example, many new apartments were built, more supermarkets were open, but after these students leave, who will rent these additional apartments, who will go shopping in these extra supermarkets? Please not mention the future students, just I said, no more student will come if they find their former people all go back only with a degree but no any industry or useful experience. We all know that in STEM major, working experiences are more important than degree. It is the same all over world. No one will waste time at a place without job.
