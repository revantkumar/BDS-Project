This opt extension proposal is extremely beneficial for U.S. economy and should be approved with no hesitation.

Firstly, foreign students contribute a significant amount of money, like tuition and living expenses into the U.S. economy. For example, I am studying in University of Michigan and a lot of local restaurants and other service providers (gas, electricity, water, network) relies on the international students.

Secondly, for those U.S. employers who want to expand their business to foreign countries will definitely benefit from the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying and working in the United States.
