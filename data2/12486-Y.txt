The improving of OPT extension will benefit not only academic institutions, but also local business, especially business around schools, universities and institutions.

One reason why international students apply for American institutions instead of institutions in other countries is the OPT extension program. International student financially support American academic institutions. With money from international students, institutions can provide better facilities to local students, pay more to professors and stuffs and invest more on cutting edge studies. Without less OPT extension or even no OPT extension program, international students probably choose other countries instead of the US so that academic institutions will lose support financially.

The more OPT extension, the better for local business. Once students have more extensions, they will benefit land owners because most of international students have to find a place to live. Not only land lords will be benefited, but also grocery stores will be benefited too, because they have to live a life. Furthermore, if international students have more extensions, they have more chances to spend money according to their own interests. All kinds of business will thrive having opt extended.
