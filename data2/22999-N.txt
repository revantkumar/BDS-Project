The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be
a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire
foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of 
available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put 
downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire 
foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. 
Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans,
but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing
their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive 
to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

I will personally lead a petition to impeach all those involved with committing this offense against the
the American people, THE VERY PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE GOVERNMENT WORKERS (POLITICIANS) WITH THEIR WAGES.
REMINDER - YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK FOR US "Government of, for and by the people...". READ THE CONSTITUTION FOR
A CHANGE!
