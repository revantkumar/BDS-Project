To gain some Neutral countries' support, like China, a big huge country, you need to have a number of Stakeholders in the US. These Stakeholders can be F1/OPT students who come from at least middle class families from China, their parents and family in China have some power to make some decisions. If the US government extent the OPT, many of the students may have chance to work for US for longer time, and want the US be strong, support what US do, the US will gain more support from these students native country!
