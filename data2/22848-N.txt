Expanding opportunities for foreign students in the current low employment climate is NOT a good idea. There are far too many employers who will take advantage of lower wage seeking employees thereby driving already stagnant wages even lower. Disney is currently mired in controversy over its layoff of hundreds of tech workers to be replaced by foreign workers. To even consider incentives that sacrifice American jobs is simply ludicrous.
