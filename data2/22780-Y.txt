What a promising policy! This can be very beneficial for both us employers and foreign students. The most important thing for students after graduation is the chance to utilize what they have learned from school and put them into practice. Current OPT-STEM policy is far behind what the industry and people have asked for. This extended 24-month STEM policy will be a clear step forward, which provides the legal authorization for foreign students to work in the US and gain more experience in their study fields. Please come up and support this policy!
