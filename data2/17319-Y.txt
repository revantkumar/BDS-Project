I strongly believe that the OPT stem extension period should be increased from 24 months to 36 months. This is will give great opportunity to STEM students to further enhance their capabilities and solidify the education they received from the prestigious schools of USA. This will benefit USA as well, with much better return on investment. They will be able to utilize these scientists for a longer time, resulting in more innovation and more drive in the technology and science sector.
