I think it is a must-have for USA because international students use their knowledge to serve companies in various industries and make these companies develop better. Some might argue that it will take the jobs for US citizens, but they forgot the fact that these international students are extremely excellent in their profession, they create much much more productivity than normal workers. By this policy, the country can have much much more potential immigrants, and very very smart ones, and that is why USA can be the leader of the worlds for decades. In turn, the country offering jobs for these international students will grow faster such that they can create more jobs.
Current H1B policy makes these students super hard to get working permit, a longer OPT periods will give them more freedom to choose the best jobs for them.
Another thing we have to consider is that currently, a lot of companies already have lots of employees in STEM status. If we cannot come up with a proper regulation, they will lose hundreds of workforce all of a sudden, that is a huge impact.
