Md Rashid Every F1 student comes to this great country with hopes and aspirations. CPT and its extension allows F1 students to work for a while to get real practical training in their fields. It also helps pay for part of their costly education loans. CapGap relief is a common sense law - it allows students to work from the end of their CPT till the start of their H1B- which is usually a couple of months. It doesnt make sense to send them back home for a few months and then have them back with H1B.

These law allows the students to work for a few years and get training/ job experience and make their own decision regarding their life and career.

I strongly urge the government to work with the international student community to make sure the proposed rule is enforced/turned into law.

Thanks.
