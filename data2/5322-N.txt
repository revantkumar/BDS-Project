I have grandchildren with degrees and lots of job experience, but cannot find a job. This legislation is taylor made for foreign nationals with businesses in the U.S. to allow them to build their business with their own countrymen and never have to use an American worker. I am a Korean War veteran and I never dreamed while in Korea that someday Congress would turn on its own citizens and give our country away as it has by allowing the border to continue unprotected, not tracking visitors who overstay their visit and take jobs, and H1B expansion. It is shameful and this legislation is just another act by congress against American workers. Please do not allow it to happen. Edward Q. Bond
