This proposed regulation would disincentivise U.S citizens from embarking on STEM careers by emplacing sub-normal initial wages for recent graduates. This situation would ensure that U.S. citizens would most likely avoid STEM educational paths, thereby creating a permanent gap in the core of permanent U.S. citizens engaged in these professions.

I am a STEM graduate (Aeronautical Engineering) now retired after many years of work in technical fields.
