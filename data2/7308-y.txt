Kevin Wong Of course, opt extension will bing huge benefits to all the country.
First, bring more extraordinary students to the states. With out opt, students from other country could hardly find job in one year and it's hard to get the H1B. High-technology like google,face book, amazon and linked ln need these workers. And also promote domestic consumptions. OPT extension would not low down citizens $ residents.
Secondly, OPT extensions will reduce company costs and STEM major students will make a difference in the 21st country. Country competition is talent person competition, the central is people. United States is the only one super country in the planet, and because of it open, freedom, equality, so all the world excellent student come here to make their American Dream. Opposite the OPT extension is definitely not the spirit of USA.
Last but not the least, STEM student will bring this country more cultural diversity.
I hope the federal government can think this extension carefully, because it is not just about the STEM students, it's about the spirt of the country. Think about the people come to US at the 18 the country in NewYork port. Only freedom, equality can bring this country prosperous. Thank you all.
