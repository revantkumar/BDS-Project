I heard that the unemployment rate has hit historical low (5.5% @ http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000), which is a strong indicator the American industry would be needing and able to digest work forces to boost the economy. We don't need to bypass the fact that the U.S. might be at a great era ever since 2008, perhaps an unprecedented one in the course of reaching a peaked economy. Turning down and expelling work force with cutting edge expertise would be exceedingly disruptive both imminently and in the long run. And also where are the diversity and equality which this country values as declared by its founders?
