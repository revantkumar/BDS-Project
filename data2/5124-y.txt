Siddhesh Dhupe I welcome this new rule. It is unreasonable to say that foreign students are taking away jobs from American citizens. Foreign students are getting what they deserve. Many employers employ only American citizens. Many foreign students leave US after graduation when they don't get suitable job.

Giving an unhindered opportunity to best talent from across the world is not just in interest of America but also in the interest of humanity, which leads to development and progress in Science and Technology. I hope better sense prevails.
