I definitely support this rule!!! STEM degrees are in high demand in the United States in order to be competitive in the world market and because the U.S. government is only recently discovering the apparent shortage of students and professionals educated in these fields the push to drive students from the U.S. and abroad into these fields has grown tremendously. So from both perspective that is US government and immigrants, it is beneficial .
