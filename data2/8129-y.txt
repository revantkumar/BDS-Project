(For easier access, I have also pasted the comments here, though less readable than in the attached file.) I firmly support this proposed rule, as it can create more domestic jobs, and promotes gender and race equality in STEM fields. Reason 1: It can create more domestic jobs. Without the OPT extension, F-1 students have a max of 12 months to practice their ideas, which hardly gives them time to even get a startup company over the incubation period [Reference 1, "The Funding primer: How a start-up moves from incubation to IPO"]. This 12-month time constraint highly discourages/forbids F-1 students from starting their own company. However with the additional 24-month extension, a total of 36 months (i.e. three years) seems to be a much feasible timeframe for the enthusiastic F-1 students (who usually start to form their ideas before graduation) to bring their startups to potentially pass the initial Series of funding, and therefore creates more domestic jobs [Reference 2, "Supporting Small Businesses and Creating Jobs"]. And even if they fail to bring their startups all the way to IPO, the process of starting a company already create domestic jobs, and generates revenue for other businesses (e.g. through renting office space).
Reason 2: It will help to promote gender and race equality in STEM fields. Various studies have pointed out the large gender and race gap in STEM fields [Reference 3, "Women in STEM: A Gender Gap to Innovation"]. In addition, multiple studies haven shown that "A higher percentage of female and minority STEM field graduate students positively impacts on the persistence of female and minority students" [Reference 4, "Persistence of women and minorities in STEM field majors"]. So to bring up the self-sustainable cycle that attracts more minority students into the STEM fields, we need the seed that can start this cycle, and F-1 students can be a good part of this seeding process with proper support (e.g. the OPT STEM extension).F-1 students are usually the minority groups in their school, so the fact that an F-1 student can get through all the difficulties in STEM major can further encourage domestic students, especially students in minority groups, to study STEM fields. 
However without the proposed rule to support an OPT extension, F-1 students are usually in a frustrated situation to look for job opportunities that can sponsor their work status not too long after graduation. These frustration and feeling of instability can give a false impression to others that regardless of how hard they study/work, minority students will simply keep encountering barriers, both academically and non-academically, that prevent them from succeeding in STEM fields.
In addition, people in minorities groups are more likely and are more effective at encouraging/mentoring people in similar situations. For example, many tech companies (e.g. Microsoft, 3M) have women mentoring program which allows women in the tech industry to better support each other [Reference 5, Microsoft Women Mentoring Program], as they tend to understand each other's situation better than men in the same industry (e.g. difficulties for working moms). So as someone in a (or more) minority group(s), F-1 students are more willing to get involved in and can effectively improve the gender and race equality in STEM fields.

However, as it typically takes a new hire 3-6 months to adjust to a new job in STEM fields [Reference 6, How long should it take a new hire to get up to speed?], if an F-1 student has to leave after one year, it seems to be very unlikely that the student can have the opportunity to contribute to help other minorities or to volunteer locally to promote STEM fields within local communicates. However with the additional 24 months, after adjusting to his/her job, an F-1 student can have enough time to get involved with various programs to promote equality in STEM fields as theyd like to.
