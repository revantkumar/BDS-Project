I am in favor of this proposal.
The OPT extension has been a strong attraction to STEM students across the world. Our local community benefited a lot from the growing number of the international students in STEM majors especially in computer science. Not only did they benefit the local market, but also started to build so many promising companies around computer science. The extension strongly encouraged them to actually build a career or even companies in U.S. With only 12 months, a huge number of them will probably just work for some big companies, get the money and leave the country.
