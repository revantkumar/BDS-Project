Tony Ben I totally support this motion. 

For those who think this motion would arise US citizen's unemployment rate, I think they are lack of basic knowledge: The statistics show that more than 85% of the students of EE and CS major are international students. 

If STEM extension is cancelled, all the well-educated talents would be heavily affected. When the link of international talents break down, academic performance, university region and local economy, high-tech industry, US's innovation ability and competitiveness all will be harmed! If 85% of the STEM students lose their OPT, That means that our STEM related industry would lose 85% of good employees! 

STEM students will not take away much jobs from US citizen because 99% American citizens are even not STEM majors!

STEM student never lower the basic wage standard. Administration needs to regulate illegal and unqualified immigrants, not talented legal STEM students who help improve economy growth!
