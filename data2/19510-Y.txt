As a foreign student, I strongly support the proposed new rules. We believe that a fair competition for the tech positions is the key to the success of tech companies and it will also boost the nation's economy in the long run. 

We pay high tuition fees to study in the United States in order to find a job. We deserve a fair competition. If this rule is cancelled, less and less foreign talents will choose to go to the US. It will eventually harm the nation.
