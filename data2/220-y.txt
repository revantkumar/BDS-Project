Subrat Dash I strongly APPROVE for this rule to come into effect. The reason being, that this would be a sigh of relief for students who hope to secure jobs here and hone their skills in their respective fields. It is not that Foreign students are taking away the jobs from U.S. Residents, I mean, nobody is putting a thought into why is this phenomenon happening in the first place? Why would a company go through the hassle of hiring an international student when they know that these students have limitations on their working hours, availability, etc. It is because the company is in a dire need of such talent and it turns out that this talent exists majorly among international students. If we the Citizens of the US want our jobs back then we ought to get them back in the right way, we cannot just sit there and hope that someone gives us our job back, the company is a business entity and they do not care if you are citizen or not as long as the work is done. Majority of the US economy is dependent on such foreign students working in high tech companies and if they go, so does our economy. Where would we find the required talent if all of a sudden there is none? Lastly, I wish to make a point that our country has always been a melting pot for foreign nationals. People from far away have come here and made their life better. And people who are rooting against this policy should realize that once upon time your forefathers were immigrants as well. They came here either to study or to work and never went back. If they had, then you would have been living a much different life altogether.
