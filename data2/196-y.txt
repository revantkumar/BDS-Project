Ling Zhang In my view, America can take many advantages from 24-month extension OPT. 
First, qualitatively, occupational market is like a ecosystem, which needs a diversity of plants to support the microbe, insects, and animals. In other words, international students with OPT, the cheap high-technology labors, like plants in ecosystem nourish the occupational market, and OPT is like soil for plants. If some plants would be removed or shorten the growth time, the ecosystem would become something wrong or some species would be extinct. There are many examples in nature. So we should choose 24-month extension OPT to keep the occupational market blooming.
Second, it would be a big loss for America that if international students could not have the extension OPT, they would come back to their mother country for work. They gain knowledge form America but do not contribute America. In addition, their mother country would take advantages from America, and even become a competitor with America. Why not keep the best one in America? The 24-month extension OPT will help to recognize the best one.
