I think OPT and STEM extension is BENEFICIAL for the country. Think about how much money we spend to raise a well educated person, especially those top universities. Shall we let them go back to other places after they finish their education? Of course not! They should make their contribution here. That's what OPT and STEM is for, to see whether they can really provide value or not. 

For those who worry about job opportunities, if the employers can't find the proper people they need, the jobs just go to other countries. It's this easy. Then why not keep these people and collect more tax?
