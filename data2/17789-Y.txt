I do not think graduates with a degree in STEM need as long as three years of pro-graduate training. If the government wants to have more high-tech foreign employees, find another proper way to let them work. By encouraging companies hire low-paid international graduates as interns, the government makes it worse for Americans to find a full-time job. The extension of OPT is not only unreasonable but also violates the benefits of this country.
