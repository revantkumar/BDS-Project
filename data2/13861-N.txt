Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have 94,000,000.00 Americans out of work and in need of a job. We have natural born college graduates with STEM degrees that should be given the opportunity to apply for these types of jobs. The training program was originally to help foreign students take the knowledge they learned to their home countries to improve the lives of others. The training program was also meant to be a temporary program not to be used as a bridge to longer-term work visa or for American companies to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans, as has been done recently by Disney. American companies save 7.65% when they hire foreign students over American students because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes. In addition, this cost social security billions of dollars a year because the STEM jobs are higher paying jobs. 

I appreciate the opportunity to respond.
