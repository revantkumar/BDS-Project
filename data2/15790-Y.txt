I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The OPT extension rule will let students who learn knowledge from U.S. universities keep making contributions to the U.S..
2. International students can contribute to the diversity to the U.S., which is a good and important feature of the country. 
3. Competition does exist and it will always be there, but it is not a bad thing. Actually, benign competition will be great helpful to keep the enthusiasm of workers and improve work productivity, which will promote the economic development of the U.S..
4. Almost all projects in STEM region will last at least 2 years. One year will not be enough for students to finish the project. Thus, they cannot gain enough working experience in the country. And studying abroad here becomes less attracting to international students.
