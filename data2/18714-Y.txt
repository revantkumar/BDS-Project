I am a citizen and I vote for this! 

I don't understand why we remit illegal immigrants but not give these students opportunities to LEGALLY work in US? We are immigration country and they are talented people for us. The thing is really simple, we just give them some time to prove themselves. 

If they are good, they can get a job as the very first step. As far as I know, it's really not easy for these guys to land a job here, most of (I mean 90% or above) them will go back to their home countries after spending very expensive tuition here. If they are good enough, they may find a shop which will sponsor their work visa. If they are really that good, they can get GC by their hard working and become new immigrants. I have to say at this point, we welcome ANY people from ANY country who can legally work in US and do their own part of contribution. Actually, VERY FEW people are able to get such further, and America welcomes these excellent talents. That's the mechanism we keep standing on the top of the world, right?

Let me ask the government, why choose illegal immigrants not precious talents, please give us an answer, we Americans deserve a GOOD answer! I don't care which Party will get the next president, just DO NOT override your Party's interests on Americans'!
