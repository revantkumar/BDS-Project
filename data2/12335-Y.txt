I agree with the extension on OPT for F-1 students in STEM majors. This will benefit the American high tech companies in acquiring best talented employees to continue their leading position in the world. Moreover, this extension is attracting the outstanding students to study and contribute to the STEM fields in the United States. The improvement and expansion of OPT for F-1 non-immigrant students will not give them any advantage in job hunting comparing to US citizens, it only provides them a chance to get into the game.
