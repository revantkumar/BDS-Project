I support the proposed STEM extension for OPT students for the following reasons:

1. The foreign STEM students who come to U.S. for education, especially for graduate schools, are the top tier students in their own county. They spend 2~5 years in U.S. to receive the best education in science related field. This is a big force that can boost the technology in U.S. and create more jobs as the industry prosper. 

2. The proposed rule made sure that proper training will be received for the stem students at work. Working experience is important after graduation for a student to find the suiting position in industry. 

3. The transparency in the reporting requirement ensures no salary discrimination will be made to foreign students.
