I strongly support the new rule. OPT extension will allow students to gain valuable experience which they can use to improve the global community. Also, this will prove beneficial to US as more students will choose to study abroad which will boost the economy of the country. Another reason to support this rule is that there is a suspicion that the tech companies will outsource the jobs to countries with cheap labor, this will harm the country's economy.
