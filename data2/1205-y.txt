Anonymous Anonymous I support this plan because for those STEM students, their original period of OPT time is 12+17 months = 29 months, well the 3-year opt period is 12*3=36 months, so if this plan get pass, those who major in STEM only get 7 more months. 

if this student is a talent one, 7 more months can help the one get one more time to apply H1B visa, can give this person more time to practices no matter will he stay in the US in future or not. However if this one is not that competent, even 3 more years cannot help him.

So there is nothing to be feared. just more 7 months for those students.
