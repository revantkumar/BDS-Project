Vikas Khanna To Concerned Authority,

I totally support stem extension and it should be given to all the worthy applicants, here are the few points in the support for my comments.

1. First of all non of the immigrant want to steal or take away someone else Job, And talking about the competition for a Job is even very high within the immigrants also so no one is safe or permanent in the job unless they perform well.

2. Stem extension will not only will give a student opportunity to show his skills but will also give them chance to a greater exposure of the corporate world of there respective field.

Moreover talking about the economy of the country, It only get's affected by the immigrants only?
