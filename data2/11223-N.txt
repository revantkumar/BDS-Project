Obama is trying to destroy USA, no real (net) job was created since he was elected, now he wants to create the illusion as if there were a lot jobs in the USA, so we need to train /or get foreigners. Company wants cheaper foreign workers already had done out-sourcing, no need to have his help! 

How about creating some new laws to encourage US employers to hire the jobless good young Americans first; by lowering corporation tax for the US company who has net increase in hiring US employees? Obama has a brain? So frustrating to see him doing his worse for his people.
