I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from the US universities stay longer in the country, and let them making contributions to the US using what they learned in the US universities.
2. Diversity is very important for the US. International STEM students make up a big part of the high tech industry work force, which contributes significantly to US's economy and technology development.
