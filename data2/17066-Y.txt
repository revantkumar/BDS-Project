I strongly agree with the arguments in this proposal. First, It takes a long time for training a entry-level engineer or scientist to a intermediate or professional engineer. So by extending OPT the trained engineers can stay longer and create more profit for USA. Also, a longer OPT period is also a good reason for international students choosing USA as their study country and as most of them are self-paid their intuition, it's also a good way to relief the current pressure of USA on education.
