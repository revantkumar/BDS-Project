First and for most, I fully support the extension the OPT period for STEM students by 24 months, and I believe the support and approval of this change would be a win-win for both US universities and F-1 students.

As a STEM student myself couple of years ago, I know how much time, effort and financial investment my family and I have put into help me work through tough Materials Engineering course works in University of Southern California. As we tried our best to gain knowledge on campus, the full journey would be meaningful with on-hands working experiences here. It is tough enough for F-1 students to compete with US citizen in job market already, and with the CAP-CAP and restrictions on OPT STEM extension, it makes things harder. Luckily, I made through and obtained my H1-B working visa, but I know I will support the OPT extension no matter what to make sure that these F-1 students could enjoy the study here without worrying too much of not getting equal opportunities for what they pay for.

As a spouse of a graduating F-1 student, the pressure of worrying the time limit for job searching and our family future is imposing on us every single day. Because we know we would probably settle down without knowing that we could get enough time to find jobs. So not only the STEM OPT extension will help the individuals, but also it is crucial to change and important to family as well.

Last but not least, there are many foreign students working hard and invest themselves to get into US universities for better quality education along with working experiences. If the OPT extension policy would change for their benefit, I believe it will keep the trend and attract more to come. It is without doubt a good thing for US economy, stronger working force, diversity and innovation.

Thank you for your time to review, and I hope you could seriously consider to extend the OPT period for STEM students. I really appreciate it.
