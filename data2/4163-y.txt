Melissa Rico I'm writing on behalf of the American graduates that can't get jobs because of the foreign students getting the first choice for these jobs. I'm concerned that these foreign graduates that promised to go back to their homelands after they finished study's and they have broken their promise to do so. These people need to go back home ASAP. American graduates can do theses jobs and they will be helping the unemployment numbers here in the homeland.
Please put a stop to this problem and help Americans out for a change. Sincerely Melissa Rico
