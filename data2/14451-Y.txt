Strongly support this proposed rule to expand training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees. Well-educated STEM talents have high value for economy, especially for the U.S. which has shortage of talents in IT and engineering area. And as a international student, I wish I can have more opportunity to practice my skills acquired with such expensive tuition fees.
