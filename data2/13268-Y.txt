I strongly support this rule for following reasons:

1. If students who accomplished their degrees in U.S. have more opportunities to work in U.S., it will attract more International students to study in U.S. This will increase U.S. academy schools' competitiveness globally.

2. U.S. is a diverse country. Diverse is very important and it can make lots of people to make more contributions to U.S.

3. Although competition exists, this is not bad. This can help U.S. find best talented people, increasing average level of everyone and even create more opportunities. For example, many International students work in start-ups, which could create more job opportunities to U.S. citizens. Also, many large companies need support from OPT students. For instance, OPT students work lots of projects in the company. If they lack visa, these projects can't continue, which will be a disaster for these companies.
