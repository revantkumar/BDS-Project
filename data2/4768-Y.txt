I strongly support this proposal. Now it is already difficult enough for freign student to find a job. Let them stay will INCREASE not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high.Closing the door will destroy our tech industry rather than preserving jobs.
