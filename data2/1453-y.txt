SRI red 1)stem opt extension is very useful for the international students to explore the knowledge they have learnt in there classroom training.
2)It helps the international students to gain the practical experience by working in the field of various technologies like software and other related fields.
3)1 year of OPT is very short term and I think 24 months of stem extension is really necessary and helps the international students to explore in USA and also encourages the future students who are are coming to USA from different countries across the world
