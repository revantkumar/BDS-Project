Jon Agosti The OPT program is meant to be a temporary training program, not a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger and cheaper than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. 

There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.

Do not change regulations to further displace American STEM citizens. 

Thank you,
