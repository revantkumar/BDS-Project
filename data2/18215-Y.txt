Students come to US universities to learn advanced knowledge and earn better lives no matter US or home counties. They are NOT treated better than American citizens. several years post graduate working period is vital for graduates to step out of US classroom and experience true American way of working & living. This will promote US's impact on the world in terms of hardworking and innovative thinking. Again, OPT students are NOT treated better than Americans. Employers still prefer American citizens under the same circumstance. If OPT doesn't exist, international students (majority Chinese and Indian) will go back to their own countries immediately - They have been fine - creating jobs and contribute to their own economies. Lots of them would not even come to the US in the first place - consider how many universities are funded by expensive international tuitions. Chinese students are NOT begging to stay but, really, they want to experience the best and brightest part of US. Does US want to expand its impact to the world? DHS can make it happen.
