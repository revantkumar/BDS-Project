To me, it seems that the Department of Homeland Security 's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training Program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the U.S. from one to three years. As such, it artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of U.S. workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of U.S. workers.

This rule will put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. It is hard enough already for U.S. workers, especially recent American graduates, to find work, and this would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
