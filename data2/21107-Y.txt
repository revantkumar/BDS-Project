I believe OPT-extension IS NECESSARY for our country.

OPT could attract more outstanding foreign tech professionals come to contribute on USs development. And these foreigners contributed tremendous growth to US tech industry and economy. US should keep these people, rather than let them back to their own country! If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another normal country where miracles no longer happen. Without the embraciveness of foreign workers, I can forsee someday very soon when USA economy stagnates, people lose jobs, and social problems arises. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.
