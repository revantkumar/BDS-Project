I strongly agree 24 months STEM OPT extension. It's really necessary for international students get this opportunity as other American people, could use their knowledge and skills that they learn from American universities to contribute to the American society. I believe that America is fill with freedom and dream, it's where we can build dream together no matter what color of our skin. I hope it will come true.
