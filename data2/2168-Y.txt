As a F1 student, I strongly support this rule proposed by HSD. 

I believe that the decision of providing better opportunities for STEM F1 students is a win-win policy for the development of foreign students careers and the development of science and economy of the United States.On one side, the passing of the rule will help students that are well educated and trained in the US, the students with real skills and passion, to continue exploring their potentials and lead a better career or even life of their choice. On the other side, the highly skilled and educated working force formed by these students would improve the performance of the US companies that hire them, would benefit the social structure of American society towards a younger, more intelligent and multi-cultural population. In all, this policy is long overdue and without a doubt should be passed.
