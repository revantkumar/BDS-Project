I strongly agree,with OPT extension.
Any country in the world,wont give jobs without knowledge.Knowledge plays key role in getting a job.so many foreign students spending a lot of money to get a better education for their future.They are taking loans from mother country for their education and spending that amount in well developed countries like USA.After completion of their education,they need work to prove themselves,In that manner they are attending job fairs competing with other students.The companies like MNC wont give jobs without knowledge.So,the international students getting jobs with their own talent.They are not taking others job.
