I am commenting on the proposed rule "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students" My daughter is a senior in High School and has chosen Engineering as her field for college. I object strongly to the attempt by big business lobby to deny citizens such as herself the opportunity at a good paying job. Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages. OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers. Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs. OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers. OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas. There is no good reason to enact this rule. STEM job wages are FLAT, not increasing!! There is NO STEM worker shortage, if there was wages would not be flat in the industry.
