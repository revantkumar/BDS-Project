Ximo Chu I'm a science PHD student, as far as I observed, the foreign students occupy a pretty high percentage in the top students and the top researches in my field. We come up with advanced research topics in nanotechnology, biotechnology and benefit native companies even when we are in collage. During the OPT period, we don't need to take care about the classes, we can engage ourselves into research, there will be incredible research coming out. 

After we graduate, since most of the companies will prefer native students, only the foreign students who are brilliant can be hired by the company, and then, we start to use OPT get much less salary and the same tax. After OPT, most of the foreign students will go back to their home country. The native companies will pay less, and gain more.

The OPT extension, will attract much more students to come here applying degree instead of the other countries. One of the important reason we choose the US, is we can get some training opportunities when we are back to our countries. The extension training opportunities are the most charming point to the students who want a study chance aboard. The large amount of foreign students will benefit the US both from their consume and their research.
