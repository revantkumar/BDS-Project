Paul Liu I strongly support this rule to extend STEM OPT for following reasons.
1.The US is a immigration country, to respect elites from all the world is the reason why we make American dream come true.
2.The US is a country recognized for best country for freedom, especially for the job market. The job market can select who can work for the US, who should leave, not policy.
3.The US is the top country in science and technology in the world, that because the US can attract well educated, smartest guys from the world. In our US history, a lot of entrepreneurs, scientists and mathematicians are originally from other countries. If the OPT extension stops, the next Shiing-shen Chern will leave, the next Chen-Ning Franklin Yang will leave, this will be a disaster of US science area.
4. The US need to be more competitive. The number of top 25% smartest people in China is bigger than the total population number of the US. If the US policy pushes the international science students to leave the US after they got educations at here, how to compete with the stronger China and faster India.
