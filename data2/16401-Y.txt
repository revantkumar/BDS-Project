I strongly support this proposed rule.

ANY races, countries has grown strong has the history of learning and observing. The United State, from the very beginning, is a immigration country. More STEM students and workers are what America needs. No matter in education or industrial world, it is not possible for anyone to produce more just because of his/her race so it is ridiculous to hear someone says this proposed rule give more jobs to immigrations over U.S. citizens. Instead, what you really should pay more effort is to encourage more U.S. citizens to study STEM majors.
