I strongly support the new proposed OPT extension rule. It should be increased from current 17 months extension to 24 months or may be more. Also, for current students who are already on OPT extension, the new regulation should allow them to extend their period by 7 months before current opt expiration. Hence, students should be allowed to apply for extension even during their grace period. 

Thanks
