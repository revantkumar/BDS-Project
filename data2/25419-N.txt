Please make it clear how this proposed rule helps the millions of Americans currently out of work and seeking employment as well as the million of Americans who are currently in school and will be seeking employment in the near future. At this point in time, it is unconscionable for foreign workers to take jobs Americans would otherwise fill, leaving many of those Americans to seek welfare benefits and utilize other social programs for the poor, further burdening our economy and budget deficit.
