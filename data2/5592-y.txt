David Quinn By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 50% - from US$4.4 trillion in 2012 to US$6.2 trillion. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule.
