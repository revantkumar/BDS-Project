I strongly support this decision to extend STEM to 24 months. 

First of all international students are not stealing any one's jobs. Students come to united states to gain practical knowledge apart from academics. We all know that theoretical knowledge is not equivalent to practical knowledge. Extending the period to gain practical knowledge does not mean that you are giving rights to international student to become citizens of United States. Students will be anyways going back to their respective countries once their STEM expires. We should not compare illegal immigrants with legal ones. 

Also during this learning process students do contribute a lot to their employers. This in turn generates revenue for the employer and ultimately for United States. Its wrong to say that students work for low wages when on STEM. Pay packages are set as per the skill set the student has. Again we should not mix illegal immigrants with legal ones.

As an international student right from day one when they enter united states they provide revenue to United States by different means. Paying rent, paying tuition fees for 2 years or so, food, tourism, shopping, etc. They kind of help to generate good amount of revenue for local businesses. Majority of the students come on student loans from their home country. After spending this amount don't we think that the international students have some rights to earn back a little for what they have spent? Imagine if number of students entering United States decline it would impact US economy a lot. Also United States wont get the best of brains from around the world.
