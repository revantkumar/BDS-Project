Please extend the term of STEM Extension to 24 months. It would serve two purposes.
It will be advantageous to International Students as well as it will grant more time to their work organization to decide if the student is a real asset to the company.

STEM Extension works like a symbiotic relationship that will equally benefit the employer and employee. I would greatly appreciate if you could consider this points before coming to a decision.
