Roy Kuo I strongly support this rule. OPT extension for STEM students is an essential and required steps to boost US economics in technology/engineering related areas, which has been a key domain that helps US grows in an effortless fashion in the past 50 years. Without letting new and young top workforce and talents from all over the world joining this area, US's leading position built in the past 50 years (e.g. silicon valley) will quickly fade away, and be taken away from other new thriving countries. As a result, I strongly support this rule. This rule is not only a good-to-have regulation, but a must-to-have regulation for US.
