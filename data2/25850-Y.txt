We have been talking about economic development all the time. 1) What do we need for economic development? We need people with knowledge, skills and intelligence, especially the students in STEM field. OPT has been a good way for international students to contribute to the economic development after they complete their studies. 2) What is the purpose of economic development? I have to say it's the development of local economy, including creating jobs, paying taxes, etc. Some people may wonder if these STEM students will "steal" their jobs, however, the answer is absolutely no, because all the STEM students work to create value and more jobs for other people. In sum, I strongly support the OPT extension for STEM students.
