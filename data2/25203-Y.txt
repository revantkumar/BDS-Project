I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. This proposal give those STEM students a chance to contribute to the US. After getting degrees and much resources from higher education, these students as human power are precious for technology companies in US. The universities gave foreign students time and resources to improve their professional skills, and they indeed prove their worth in the process. I believe it's a pity if US companies can't hire these STEM students. STEM students with good education can help US to be stronger, against other companies in different countries.

2. Diversity is also important for the technology companies in the US. Many great achievements were done in the US by people who were foreigns, like Elon Musk. One great factor in the success of US is that it accepts professionally great people from different places, regardless of their origin countries. As long as companies want to hire these students, it's good to have the OPT extension to benefit technology companies.
