I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Talent foreign students come to US for education is not only because US has higher education quality but also because US allows them to stay for some time for practical training after graduation. If the OPT 
extension is cancelled, it would have a huge bad impact on these universities' international recruition and education quality.

2. Foreign students and workers have huge positive impact on local economy. After they come to US, they need to rent house, go to restaurant, buy ATT or T-mobile plan, go to travel, buy commercial products like Mac, iphone and cars. This would boost local economy.

3. After graduation, it is government's responsibility to keep the talent engineers staying in US rather than pushing them out. See what a fierce combat we have today for talent people. Companies like Baidu, Alibaba come to US to hire people back to China. Facebook, Amazon and Google go to China and India to hire people. Singapore forces high school students to work there for at least 6 years after graduating, if they want to be considered as a candidate for their Universities.

4. Even you cancel opt extension, it may not be able to improve the chance of employment of US citizen. Think about the risk of hiring a foreigner. They might not be able to get h1b and then company may lose them forever. Their language is not that fluent etc. US citizen already have much more advantages than foreigners when seeking jobs. But still why would some companies like to hire foreigners? Thus, the key answer to solving unemployment is not by decreasing competition, but by increasing education quality and encouraging talents to create more job openings.
