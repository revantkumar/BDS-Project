I think this rule will help F1 students gain substantial amount of practical experience to compliment their education in the US. 12 months is a very short period to gain any practical knowledge, so I believe the extension will benefit the international students in gaining global experience before returning to their home country. Some international students have to spend a lot of money to study in US and OPT is the only way to gain that value back in terms of practical experience and knowledge. I SUPPORT this new extension rule and I want the US authorities to approve it.
