Anonymous Even Henry Ford knew that unless you pay your workers enough to afford to buy the very product they produce,you are defeating the purpose of manufacturing it in the first place. Do the globalist Zuckerbergs and Gates of the world have to get to that point in time to stop their traitorous actions of buying our Govt. Officials to allow Cheap labor. As for the foreign workers begging to work for pennies on the dollar,they will be known as Chumps.
