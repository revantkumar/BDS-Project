I have a PhD in Engineering and I believe that allowing this rule to pass does not benefit American STEM graduates. This allows companies the opportunity to hire non-Americans for positions that should be filled by American workers, thereby suppressing wages for STEM graduates and discouraging the next generation of American students from pursuing STEM careers. American universities and businesses hiring in the USA should be encouraged to hire a diverse array of American students.
