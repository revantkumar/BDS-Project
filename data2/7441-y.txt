Chengqing Hu The 24-month STEM OPT extension amendment is a must if the United States of America is to keep its dominance in attracting and retaining top talents from all across the globe. With my sincere hope to keep USA as the true world-wide leader in various technology sectors, I'm soliciting to our US federal government to make this influential proposal be passed. So many diligent and smart STEM degree holders are looking forward to contributing to this lovely country (USA) and its society while chasing their American dreams. It's undoubted that passing this amendment proposal will benefit the whole US society both in short and long terms.
