Pei Jin I strongly support the rule. I have several reasons. First, opt extension will attract more talents to US to study. As we know, when students decide where to study they will take length opt into consideration. That is also the reason that many students choose U.S instead of U.K for high education. In addition, currently many universities have high percentage of international students who pay high tuition to the universities and the universities could make profit from international students. If opt extension was rejected, I doubt whether U.S would l be as attractive as before for the international students and whether the American universities would suffer from the decreasing number of international students. Second, to keep a healthy and repaid growth of economy, U.S needs to attract more talents instead of getting the talents out of their countries. In the past years, these foreign talents contributed much more to the American economy than most people thought. Third, rejecting opt extension will leave a chance to other developing countries, such as China and India, to catch up with the United States much easier than before. Some my Chinese friends told me they hoped opt extension would be rejected and hoped more Chinese students would go back to their countries and would contribute to their country's economy instead of working for the United States. As we know, as China's economy becomes better and better, it has already attracted more and more student back to China. We need to keep the talents and attract them staying at United States for our own good. In sum, it is good to have opt extension for the American economy.
