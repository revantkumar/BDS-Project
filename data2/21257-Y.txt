I strongly support the proposal for following reasons:

1. As an international student, I expect to have meaningful period of training in industry. Concerning my major, computer science, I expect an at least 2 years training to get any useful experience. A short OPT will definitely change my decision on whether bother taking the OPT at all. Training opportunities are crucial for majors like computer science when choosing universities in different countries, and it's right now a definite advantage for all the universities in U.S.; without this main competitive strength, I suspect a huge drop in the number of international students. After all, there's a maximum number of months for OPT, the "jobs" taken by OPT as some of the other comments suggested are to be returned, but the potential huge drop of international students will be a great loss and hard to recover.

2. OPT extension is not a threat for any qualified native workers at all. I cannot agree with some comments' exaggeration and providing non-general examples with no proof that OPT is the problem for somebody not getting a job. It's obvious that the number of students is limited and the time is limited. To whom thinking companies prefer workers in OPT, it's common sense that companies prefer stable workers rather than the new grads who are very likely to leave after a year or two. I cannot see any benefits taken from native workers at all. 

3. Taking away these opportunities from international students doesn't mean that they will necessarily go to those who complain about it. Competition is crucial for a company to stay alive and stay healthy, as a result, a company won't let unqualified people in and won't force qualified people out. Companies are trying to attract best people in field, the positions will just not exist if there are no people qualified for it.
