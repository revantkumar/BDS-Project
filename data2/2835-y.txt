Tina Jia I strongly support this policy!
As an international student, I chose to come to U.S mainly because of the OPT extension policy. The OPT extension can help me gain a lot of work experience after graduation, which I believe is beneficial for my future career. Also as an engineer student, I know many programs and researches cannot be finished within one year, so the OPT extension is really necessary for students who work in an engineering or technology company.
Many countries don't have the OPT policy for international students, and I think that's why most of international students choose U.S. Without this benefit, the number of international students will definitely reduce, and I think this will also reduce the income of educational institutes and other industries. It is obvious that the huge number of international students stimulate the economy in U.S. And create more job opportunities for U.S. citizens. I don't understand why some people are still complaining that finding a job is difficult. 
The OPT extension is a win-win policy. International students can gain valuable work experience and the economy in U.S. will develop better.
