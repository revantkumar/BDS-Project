I Strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension. After the study in the U.S., foreign students need OPT to make their contributions to U.S. Many important scientists and engineers in U.S now were foreign students before. American is a society with different kinds of people and it needs the most intelligent people from all over the world to boost it's economy and science achievements. 

Also, the OPT extension would attract more excellent students to come to US and they will make contributions to the local economy by paying rent, paying tuition, and traveling.
