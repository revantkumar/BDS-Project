Yashu Chen My boyfriend is a Chinese PhD student in computer science engineering, I feel that he plays a key role in contributing to development of USA with his research on computer vision and data mining. More importantly, OPT-extension can allow him to be quite professional in this field by working in technology companies, such as Microsoft and Facebook. 

I am a PhD student in communication. I teach several courses in this area, such as business and professional communication and intercultural communication. MY teaching contributes to mutual understandings and cultural exchange between Chinese nationals and Americans. OPT-extension will enable me to do more good to Americans' understandings of China, and Chinese nationals, which indirectly benefit diplomatic relationships between the two countries.
