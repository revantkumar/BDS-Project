Geraldine Jones Strongly support this new OPT extension rule. As for a STEM students, the researches and projects that I get involved in are relatively complex, which definitely requires more than a year. For example, the project that I'm currently in is 3-year period. Students in this project are trained specifically for this project, most of which are foreign STEM students. If the OPT extension can not get pass, we'll definitely lose a lot talented STEM students, and need to take more time training new students. Instead, with the new OPT extension, these students can keep working on this project for another 2 years, which also saves the company a lot more money to recruit and train new students. So I definitely support this new rule.
