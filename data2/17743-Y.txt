I need opt extension to help to increase the chance of getting h1b. Nowadays almost none of the pharmaceutical companies are willing to sponsor h1b because there is only one chance for the international student to apply h1b, and the result of getting h1b or not only depends on lottery, in the other word, lucky. The United States has already spent so much money on training graduate students and finally these people have to leave the country just because they didn't win this one-time lottery. It is such a tremendous loss for the country. If we can get opt extension, the chance of winning the lottery would be higher, at least we could have three chances. So please, take this into account when you make the final decision.
