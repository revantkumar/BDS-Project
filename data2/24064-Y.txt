International students and international exchange contribute far more than monetary and job gains to the economy. We cannot underestimate their immeasurable academic and cultural contributions to America's colleges, universities and local communities. They also bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs, and support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework.
