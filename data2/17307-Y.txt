Hi,
I support the proposed stem OPT rule because of the following reasons:

1. For STEM courses, the 12 months of OPT is insufficient as these require longer training for getting right skills. So 24 month extension will give sufficient time for students to learn all the skills and to get trained on cutting edge technologies.

2. US will be more competitive and superior because of the retention of the talent pool in the country, which will help the technological advancement in the country.

3. If we see the financial aspect of it, US would be benefited with lots of revenue because of the taxes that the students pay while they are in STEM OPT. The economy will get a boost because of more spending.

Hence I totally support the proposed STEM rule.
