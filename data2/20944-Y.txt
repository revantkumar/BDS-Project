I must say that I SUPPORT the proposal.

I earned my degree from one of the best Ivy League Colleges. There I met lots of very smart international friends. Their visions always inspired me. I have heard stories about Korea, Japan, China, India, etc. It helps me understand the difference between countries and between different people. I think communications and deep relationship is the only way, we, as human beings can improve ourselves and our society. 

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S because diversity is very important for large US universities and corporations. 

I also understand some of you who mentioned competition. I admit that competition exists. But in a good way.
