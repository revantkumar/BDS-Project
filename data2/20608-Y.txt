Bring competetion out of US will only harm the whole nation and world. We must keep those talented students to make our every industry to thrive. U.S. is on high speed growth, we do need those young people to keep this speed. We don't want to lose so many smart brains. If we let them go, all bad things will come. Some highly developed areas like bay area will lose its light ! We don't want New York's night be so dim because we do things wrong. Force STEM students to leave will stop more STEM students coming. U.S. will just let go lots of profits. No just money at this moment, but also the future in the world's competetion stage!
