I definitely support this plan for the following reasons.
1) It is beneficial for US's advanced education. If the training period is short, it will be less attractive for international talented students to study in the US. Multiculture and diversity is key element is the US campus, which is also the exhibition of american spirit.
2) It has positive impact on US economy. International talents form a strong power in US market. They utilize their potentials to promote economy boom in the US. Without them, US talent resource market will face instability and inadequate even vacuum.
3) More international students also help spread US culture and social belief and spirit to the world, which can enhance the US's status in the world.
