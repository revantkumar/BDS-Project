Ramasamy Gopalan I support the stem extension. I might be biased because I am on OPT and looking forward for more years in USA via the OPT Extension.

why for?

1) Its good for the US economy. American education is costly. Foreign students contribute both as a fund source and also as the knowledge base. Higher education has a fair share of foreign academicians. 
2) OPT Extension benefits human resources who are (1) risk takers (2) Well Educated and geared towards improving human standards (3) Fairly better intelligence
3) Cutting the OPT Extension sends a clear message to students who has worked hard through out their life that American dream is not based on merit / hard-work. 
4) Good for Companies in US to stay in US. Better probability, the next google is not in another country.

why not?
1) A good portion of people whose life is comfortable will be affected by incoming immigrants and job deficit. 
2) Immigrants may be bring in unattractive cultural habits.

Bottom line: It would be suffice to say these good many people are more probable to change their cultural habits and blend in.
They also contribute/benefit to general well being of today's globalized world and USA. 
They will be shun out by the population, who wanted to live comfortably in a competitive world.
