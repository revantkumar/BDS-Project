OPT, like other employment-visa programs, will end up lowering the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the shrinking middle class.
This is another plan to enrich tech companies at the expense of tech workers who are already suffering from flat wages for years and lack of employment for well trained and highly qualified STEM grads. 
DHS is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.
Your proposal will artificially expand the already crowded domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, 100 percent of new "imported" recruits will be young, cheap, and inferior, and none of the new imported recruits are almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers)."
Your program also abuses the tax payer by considering these new imports as students, they will not pay payroll taxes and the bill for services and resources they use and requires will be subsidized by the American tax payer for the benefit of international corporations who do not have the best intentions for this country and her people.
