weiheng qian I strongly support the new OPT extension rule, first of all, no matter you are the US citizens or aliens, we all sure this is a country which is outstanding on earth since we all hold the same standard which is equal, we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights! the at among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. we all do know i am quoting the sentence in United Staes Declaration of Independence,one of the best-known sentences in the English Language. The history of USA is a history of immigration, no matter how hard we went through before, this country will always share the way to any aliens around the world who just wish to works hard and do their best in their lives.

Secondly, I am a computer art master major student from China, why i came here since i can see the future through the ideas or inventions that were originated from this land,they inspired me and keep me work harder to catch up. i met many unbelievable talented people who were not holding the green card holder or US citizens, but they work so great with the local guys over the computer science and art area and do many creative projects that generating lots of jobs opportunities for any people in this country.

Thirdly, our skill over the profession could be really useful for the economy in US, may be we don't have school to inform us that we could opinion ourselves in this way, but we actually all got informed by others aliens classmate , i believe each individual is able to change by announcing themselves and change the world a little bit, all of us are same even though we are in different races and nationalities, there is no white american, black american, latino american or asian american or aliens american , there is United States of America!

At end, i wanna make a self declaration, no matter you support or oppose this extension rule, i will always respect and unite everyone even we may not agree with each other, i will still continue to works harder with appreciation, and that is my creed that i learned from the spirit of USA.
