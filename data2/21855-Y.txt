I strongly support the proposal for the following reason:
1. I am a current graduate student in Columbia University, major in Computer Science. Now I am looking for an job in technical company in which I am sure I can make a big contribution for the US society.
2. Diversity is very important for the US. Lots up international student made a lot of achievements not only for the US, but also the whole world.
3. Our international students bring benign competition in the US, helping both international students and local Americans make progress.
Therefore, I strongly support the proposal for the following reason.
