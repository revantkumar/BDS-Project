Chad Cronce We the people of the United States of America enjoy the rights and privileges endowed by our Creator as a result of our ancestors who fought for and some paid for with and paid through their lives. Until all willing and able US citizens are working in their higher education degree field, no foreign nationals should be given any preferential treatment for degrees or jobs. Visas for technical degrees and jobs should have been significantly cut back for much longer than currently implemented and proposed. This philosophy should be held until the job participation rate has returned to pre-2008 and pre-2001 levels. It is a matter of national security that US citizens with technical degrees such as computer science, engineering fields, and cybersecurity always get jobs first. Sadly this is not the norm. We have internationals working on projects and applications leaving safety, environmental, and cybersecurity hazards in our homeland. WAKE UP!

US citizens and the country as a whole is being hurt both in the short term and long term by outsourcing to other nations by external means and by this case internal means. This form of staffing is a form of corporate welfare and allowing them to circumvent, condoning, tax aversion. STOP this cronyism! States across the US are growing because "blue chip", energy, petrochemical, oil, and gas companies are growing in less costly states. Who wants to relocate, personnally and corporately, to states who have significantly higher coasts of living and doing business? These costs come in the form of state and county taxes, property costs, and complicated or heavy regulations. Implement a national flat tax, reduce government bureaucracy and departments, and reduce handouts, so-called entitlements. Solve our nation's problems and Stop the bandaids!
