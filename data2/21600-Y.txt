I strongly support this proposal which extends the current opt extension. Right now students only get 1 year of OPT and it's getting harder to get H1B. If we don't have extension, then those hired new grad foreign students will leave job before they even get familiar enough or have the ability to contribute substantially to the job he/she has. Retain or, even bettern, to extend the extension will be mutually beneficial to both US tech sector and those foreign students. US will be benefited by foreign students contributing significantly more to the tech economy and create a more friendly environment which could attract more talents to tech industry.
