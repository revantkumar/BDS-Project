I believe the proposed rule from DHS to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a severe detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates, and is unconscionable at a time when millions of American workers are unemployed or have even stopped looking for work altogether. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes and can pay foreign workers significantly below the prevailing wage. Immigration policy should help American workers, not harm them.
