I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The STEM students learnt knowledge from U.S. universities, they holds a master or PhD degree in science and engineering area, and the government paid the tuition, service fee... for most of these students, there's no sense to stop them making contribution to the country after they graduate.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, and there are a lot of scientists, engineers who made tremendous to U.S. were international student in U.S universities before they succeed. 

3. Competition does exist, but will not affect the major job market. And competition is not a bad thing. With proper competition, the companies can hire the employees who can make better improvements and profits for the companies, which will not only helps the growth of the companies, but will also stimulates the economy of the country.
