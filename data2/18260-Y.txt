I think the extension of opt is good for many tech companies such like google, facebook and microsoft. Now most of the students in the major of ee or cs are from Asia. People in America are seldom seen in the classes of these areas. I think the US government needs to keep the growth of the high tech companies by keeping and attracting more F1 studens.
