Jason Richter My brother, who just graduated as valedictorian of his electrical engineering bachelor's degree program, is having the hardest time finding a job. He's also a disabled Army Veteran. Yet, you want to give foreign students more of an ability to take jobs away from our own citizens? Incredulous! It's time we start worrying about ourselves, and stop trying to provide for the rest of the world. This administration cares more about how humane we look to everyone else (especially our enemies), than taking care of American citizens and our needs. It's truly despicable.
