The extension of OPT for F1 students has benefits in many aspects. In general, I agree what has been declared in the 'Cost and Benefit' section. The proposed rule will be beneficial for education and industry.

For a long time US universities provide the finest education quality and environment for students from all over the world. The international fresh blood is one of the major reasons these universities can be constantly competitive. F1 visa holders provide these schools both high-quality students and excellent faculties as well. A large proportion of this population rely on OPT to find their position in the job market. With the current 17-month OPT, many of them will have to leave simply because of bad luck. So obviously, one of the benefits of this proposal is that the attractiveness of US universities would be largely enhanced, and those real good legal immigrants will be more likely to be able to stay and contribute.

Second of all, the reason for some US residents' opposing this rule is their worries about jobs being taken by 'foreigners'. But they neglect the fact that outstanding international STEM students are also an active group of people creating jobs. Many successful high-tech companies are started by immigrants. These companies hire US residents as well as immigrants, and their owners are also H1 visa demanders. Not long ago, a founder of Twitter had to leave US because he could not get H1 visa by the end of his OPT. You could imagine that the extension of OPT would create a much more friendly environment for these immigrants to start their businesses, help keep industries booming and result in the creation of millions of jobs, which is good for everyone. So to a great extent, the worry of opponents is unnecessary. 

Based on these facts and analysis, I think this extension has overwhelming benefits. I hope it can pass.
