SRINIVAS G OPT provides a very good & Legal opportunity for students to work & gain experience and they will be paying around 25% Taxes on all the income they get + the sales taxes on items they buy during the time period they stay in USA + after they may apply for H1B by which they will be paying more than 30% taxes which is boosting US economy. I strongly encourage the extension of OPT.This also attracts more students across the world to come to US which again means huge revenue to all the US universities. In every which way its only GOOD to the US economy.So I strongly encourage the extension of OPT
