To REPS. and Senators:
U.S. citizens have pleaded with you to stop giving our jobs to foreigners, but since you never protect our jobs, I want to know just why you are bringing more and more in to take our jobs?

That's the least you can do, tell us why campaign dollars are more important than our livelihoods?

Why not train our own citizens? Because businesses want cheap laborers, you do their bidding!

One day our citizens won't even be able to purchase big business' s products, let alone take care of our families!
