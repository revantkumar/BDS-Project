I would like to ask employees of DHS, our congress and our President, who pays your ungodly high salaries? Tax paying American workers, you know, the ones who by great mistake elected you. If you side step the proper protocol to expand this current asinine program you are truly anti-American. I oppose this blatant thumb your nose at the American student, for your own private anti-American agenda. Why don't you all do something for the benefit of America for a change. That is what you were elected to do. Stop this expansion. We The People don't want it!!!!
