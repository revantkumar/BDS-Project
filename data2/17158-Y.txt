I wholeheartedly support this regulation. It gives STEM international students who have invested time and money in an education in the USA ample time and opportunity to practice their craft in a prime environment. 

Two remarks. Firstly, does the proposed rule take into account the tax benefits the government receives from STEM employment for these 3 years to counter the costs. I didn't see any references to it in the proposal.

Secondly, what provisions do international students have to stay in the US after their training period?Typically, they either apply to the H1B and are subject to a cap that includes applicants who haven't been in the US before (and have less US-based work experience) or go back to their home country. There should possibly be rules that address more convenient ways for students who have invested and graduated from accredited American universities to be able to continue being employed in the US. At this point, they have valuable work experience than other H1B applicants and there should be provisions to keep them employed.
