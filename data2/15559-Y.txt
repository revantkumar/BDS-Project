I strongly support the extension of OPT. 

As a female student, I believe US is the best stage for female students to prove their ability in science and technology. The OPT policy make a big difference for us to realize our dream of becoming a computer scientist. And gender diversity is very important for the U.S, especially for IT companies.

I hope the OPT extension policy can be approved soon so that this country will continue to attract brilliant minds and more female scientists.
