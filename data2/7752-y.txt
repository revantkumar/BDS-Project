Tao Zhang I strongly support this rule for the following reasons. First, most F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees are doing jobs which native students don't like to do because STEM majors are took by more and more international students. Thus, this rule won't harm the employment and benefit of native students. Second, if this rule is not approved, many companies in IT and Engineering fields in United States have to dismiss the workers whose OPT have ended and recruit new staff every year, which is bad for them because they need to spend a lot of time and money to train new staff again and again. Third, international students with STEM degrees working in United States make large contributions to the development of Science and Technology industries. Expanding their OPT period will only promote the economic growth in United States.
