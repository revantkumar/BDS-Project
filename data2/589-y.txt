Harry Dickens You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. STEM graduates are creating more and more jobs for everyone.

The additional OPT time will provide STEM graduates with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity.
