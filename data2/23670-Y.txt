I'm a graduate student in computer science. I think the OPT-extension act is very necessary for both us and America. Because computer science is an emerging field, which needs a lot of top engineers. Clearly, high-tech firms such as Google, Microsoft need more foreign staff with these expertise to move their business forward. If this extension can not be valid, it will affect lots of high-tech firms and force thousands of foreign employers to leave. If all these people left America, in the long term, it will make US. hi-tech industry much ess competitive than other countries such as China.
