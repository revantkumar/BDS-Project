Before 9/11 we lead the world in super computer technology due to the fact we had the brightest minds coming to work in the U.S. After 9/11 it took so long to obtain student and work visas that these bright students went to other countries and the U.S. fell to 11th place in the development of super computers. I fully support this student extension.
