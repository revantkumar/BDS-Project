I strongly support the newly proposed OPT extension of 24 months. It provides graduates with US degrees added ability to secure employment in the US under an H1B visa. As these visas for new applicants at for-profit institutions is capped, having more time to get through for people that have legitimate employment will greatly increase the ability for the US to retain valuable workers, who otherwise would apply skills that they largely learned in the US in other countries.

Note that although the increase in OPT extension time is extremely helpful, it does not solve part of the core problem for companies that they have to obey to a very limited H1B cap number for new applicants each year. It is my hope that as a different part of the immigration discussion this issue is also dealt with. Until then I strongly support the current proposal.
