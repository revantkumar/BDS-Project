Being a international student , I have to say extending the OPT for STEM student would bring many benefit to the American society :
1. It would benefit the economy of America, since there would be more international student come to the United States to study.
2. It would enable America to keep more intelligent and talent individuals.
3. It would be helpful to improve the international image of the America.
4. It improves the relationship between the America and other countries.
