The longer opt extension will not take away job opportunities from U.S. resident. Actually, the resident have more advantages on foreign students when they are looking for jobs, for example, the residents do not need visa support from the company, and they can take whatever jobs after graduation. Based on my experience, the companies prefer to hire people with H1B, green card, or citizen status since they do not need to pay to apply the visa for those employees. So, if the US residents, who are saying the foreign students will threaten their jobs, are strong enough, nothing will prevent them from getting the job. Instead, longer opt extension provides foreign students more time to do contribution to the US, especially apply what they learn in US to the US development. I believe that is the good news for the US long term development.
