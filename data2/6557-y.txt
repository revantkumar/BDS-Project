Alex Yin This policy is extremely important and should benefit everyone in the US for the following reasons:

1. It is a joke to fight against any immigrants, because we, the people of United States, were immigrants in history! These eligible students are talented and all well-educated. If we reject these people, what other immigrants do we prefer?

2. If we cancel this policy, tons of young, talented, hardworking well-educated people will serve their home country instead of the US. It is obvously better for the US to keep them here rather than send them back to our competive countries.

3. These people always obey the rules, and they rarely behave improperly. We basically have no cost to keep them in the US.

4. They are the reasons that we can pay so much less money to enjoy our life, because their salary is actually pretty low, compared with the doctors and lawyers in US.
