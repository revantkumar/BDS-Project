Thomas Hyun I work for a university and I know how many STEM students are not US citizens, especially in master's and Ph.D. programs. I support an extension to STEM students' OPT period otherwise most high-tech companies will not only lose a large amount of their people instantly but will have a big trouble recruiting new employees next year. These companies are supporting us with their taxes.
