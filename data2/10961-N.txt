I have some serious concerns about allowing additional foreign workers to enter the US work force under the Optional Practical Training program given our current economic & unemployment situation. It makes no sense to increase the number of foreign workers in this country when we have so any of our own citizens under or unemployed. Instead of wasting money on this program we should instead use that money to employee & train US workers. This is yet another example of Washington, D.C. failing to be good stewards of our tax dollars!
