The new policy is a great opportunity not only for international STEM students who would like to gain working experience in the US, but also, more importantly, for the US economy. As a nation of immigrants, the US is being loved by people with American dream from all over the world. Foreign people, together with domestics, work extremely hard to realize their dream, and build this country. This policy will make thousands of hundreds of new graduates with essential knowledge of sciences, engineering, and mathematics stay in the US to apply their energy for this country. 

Anyone who has experiences in sciences should know 1 year is too short to make any discoveries. So extension of STEM OPT up to 3 years extensively enlarge the chance of major discoveries or progresses being made by international employees in the US companies or institutions. Those discoveries will create more job opportunities, and increase the US capability in worldwide competition. It is definitely a virtuous cycle.Therefore, I strongly SUPPORT the new policy.
