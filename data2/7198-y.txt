Michael Tucker I would like to support this STEM extension, those international students helped a lot at the field of science, especially technical science. Most of them are the best student in their countries, they are talented, self-motivated, they also work much harder than most of our citizens, who lost their job due to laziness and ask for more pay day by day, who the hell gonna hire those useless player in the market? Let's make a fair game for everyone, no matter where is he or she from, as written on the Constitution of America, "everyone is equal". Those international people are already part of our country, this is what we cannot deny, and we also need to admit we need them more than those lazy workers, so just let our employers make decisions, they know who is more qualified for the job and paycheck.
