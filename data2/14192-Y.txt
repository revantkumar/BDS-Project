I love this country, not only for its strong economy, easy human relationships but also its generosity for giving work opportunity to a normal international student, like me, to strengthening my English skills and work experience to better improve myself. I appreciate for all that DHS has been doing to help us to land to this country and make contribution, not only for US, but for all humane beings. --one STEM major benefited student.
