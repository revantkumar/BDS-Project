Eric su I strongly support the OPT extension proposal:

Some opponents may claim that the OPT extension lowers wage and takes Americans' jobs. The fact is that only E-verified companies can employ international students with OPT extension and these companies have promised to treat every candidate equally. I have been in several interviews and the candidates are of different races, different nationalities and different genders. So the only factor decides whether a candidate will be successful is his/her ability to accomplish the job. It is in line with the company's benefit.

With respect to the salary level, from my experience, an international student with OPT extension means s/he graduates with higher education degree in STEM majors, which are in great need by the industry. It is very intuitive from basic economics knowledge that the talents and skills of a students combining the high demand from industry lead to higher than average salary.

In conclusion, the claim that OPT extension lowers salary level and takes Americans' job opportunities does not make sense.

In addition, the high salaries earned by those talented students mean they need to pay high tax. In turn, besides their skills ans wisdom, they contribute to the whole society in a broader way.
