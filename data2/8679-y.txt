William Snedden Expanding the OPT program is a punch in the nose for those young Americans who are in a STEM program or are a graduate of a STEM program.

This expansion will encourage US employers to take advantage of alien workers while DISCOURAGING our young people from entering the STEM program or continuing to work towards graduation from a STEM program.

Why bother doing the work to graduate if there are no jobs available for US graduates! That stinks! This is a spiteful way to treat Americans, so that greedy employers can rake in more money.

The Washington cartel is ruining our young people's motivation to strive for the opportunity to realize the American dream.

This expansion should NOT PASS it should be flushed down the commode.
