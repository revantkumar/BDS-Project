Tejeshwar Chandra Kamaal I strongly support extension of OPT. Education should provide equal opportunites for all students. Foreign students with talent and ability to prove their worth should given an opportunity to work in the best companies in the world. USA is the technology hub in the world and foreign students who aspire to work in those companies should be given a chance to work, as the experience of working at the best companies in the world helps them a lot to enhance their career. This should not be restricted to any student because education provided is the same for all the students in theie respective universities. Those with good skill sets are always choosen by the companies to work as companies would like to invest their time and money in those kind off students. So be it a local student or Foriegn student, companies always pick the best person for the job. So, I kindly request the governing body to provide an extension of OPT for foreign students.
