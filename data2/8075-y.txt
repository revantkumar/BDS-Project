Li Yuan I think America should give these students an opportunity to stay in this country and contribute. They work so hard in very difficult subjects and want to work in America to apply what they know. This only helps America!

American students don't want to do this. So we should allow foreign students more time to find the best job for them and for us.

These are the best kinds of people to allow in this country! 

This will help this country very much!
