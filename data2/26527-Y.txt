As an international graduate student, I strongly support the new proposal for STEM OPT extension, not only because of my own interest, but because it is beneficial for the US economy.

One significant advantage of STEM extension is that it can attract more international graduate students to American graduate school. Given that not all international students choose to stay and work in America, those incoming students will pay their tuition and spend money to support themselves thus increasing the income of local residence. 

Moreover, many international students in STEM major begin their startup after graduation instead finding a position. Those startups create tax and jobs available for local Americans, thus is positive for the employment of local people.

Due to the very competitive enrolling procedure of American graduate school, most of the STEM students are talented, bringing brilliant ideas and opinions and promoting the advance of related technologies, without introducing new social problems.

I do not see any necessities for American to regard international students as a threat.
