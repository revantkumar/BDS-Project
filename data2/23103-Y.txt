The extension is an invaluable and indispensable for F-1 students in STEM programs.

First of all, international students contributes considerably to US economy, including 1) building bridges between US and other nationalities; 2) bringing global perspectives; and 3) supporting services on campus for all students by paying out-of-state tuition. One key factor which attracts international students are the benefits of having practical training in US. This is particularly true for students in STEM programs. These scientific realms typically requires conducting scientific research which spans more than one year. The NSF research grant period for STEM is 2.9 years. [2].

Second, STEM extension can also benefit many high-tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, which contributed considerably to the US economy, without hurting the local employment. These companies use the same criteria for recruiting employees, and most times prefer US citizens for they are more culturally fit to local business.
