I strongly support the "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students". According to the statistics, one stem international student can generate 2.4 positions in U.S. Generally, STEM students are more focused on high-end technology, which is the foundation of U.S. economy and also why U.S. is the most developed country that both in Research and Sciences. Being a pharmaceutical scientist myself, based on my experience, one of the most successful ingredients for pharmaceutical companies to discover new drugs and therapies is to absorb more talents with vision.
