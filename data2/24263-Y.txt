Have you read the proposal at all? I guess not. 
You are just manipulated by someone who hates foreigners. Please read the following which is from the proposal:

"Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields. To guard against adverse effects on U.S. workers, this proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers. In addition to requiring a related attestation in the Mentoring and Training Plan, an employer would also be required to attest that: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the student's opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives."

In this research, there are tons of numbers proving the benefits international students bring in to this country:
Every 7 international student enrolled, 3 U.S jobs are created; 2,680,000,000 dollars contributed by international students in 2013 alone. 

Try to be an international student on the job market, the employers always prefer an native-born American over international students, they are hiring not because international are cheap, they are always hiring because of qualification of candidates. 

We work our ass off to try to get one equal opportunity, we pay all the taxes and do not get same beneficial as native-born American. We contribute to this country and society but treated as enemy.
