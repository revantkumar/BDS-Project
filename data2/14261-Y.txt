Being a Helth care administrator, I need to get an experience in my fieldwork. In order to that, I need enough time to stay here and get experience in my field. I strongly recommend that OPT period must be 36 months with including all the programs such as Health administration, Finance, Marketing etc. Being an international student, I need time to find out a better job in our field. Because of this reason, OPT period must be extended with including all programs.
