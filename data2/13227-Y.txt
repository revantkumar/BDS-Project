I strongly support that extension of Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees should be kept. Economy in America benefits a a lot from STEM major F1 Students. Normally, companies are willing to sponsor stem major students since most of those students are top elites form other countries. Their performances even outweigh domestic students in their career. In my point, policy itself should not discourage companies from be less willing to sponsor their ideal talents due to cancelation of the extension. Government is supposed to leave the choice to companies themselves. JI
