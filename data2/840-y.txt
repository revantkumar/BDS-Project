Stanley Shen I do support the OPT extension. Although it does bring more competition, the competition if fair. International students never get lowest wage to work, they enjoy the same salary level and benefit level. The salary they receive compensurate the skills they have. If there is no OPT extension, US big techs will def place them overseas, after all, it doesn't hurt too much since a lot of companies have overseas branch. No OPT extension means : 1. Losing a significant tax income source; 2. Losing domestic job opportunity for not only foreigner but also citizens; 3. U.S. universities will attract less international students; 4. No competition which impede the pace of innovation.
