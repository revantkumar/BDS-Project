Immigrants have done huge contribution to this country. This is acknowledged by this country. But does anyone care F-1 Nonimmigrant Students? I doubt. People always talk about risk that F-1 students come to steal their jobs. But they don't know if any US citizens are qualified for that job, there is no chance for company to hire a F-1 student. So if you are complaining that you can't find a job as a US citizen, please find the reason from yourself. Be a man, not a KID.

So I support this proposal. They have contribution to this country and benefit this society. They deserve this proposal and more.
