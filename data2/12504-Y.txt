I strongly support OPT extension. There are mainly three reasons to continue with the most important immigrant rule to open a fair legal immigrant opportunity for the talented students. First, there are restrictions for the OPT extension, the students who achieve the STEM degree. That means all the applications may be the very hi-tech talents. They could contribute so much for US not only in technology innovation improvement, but also in economics growth. Second, the applicant for OPT extension could attract much more foreign students to study in US and could continue to help to Maintain the best university system in the world. There are so many academy research and technology innovation done by the foreign students who study in the top universities. Third, the companies in Silicon Valley, New York and Taxes just need the STEM students. The reason for OPT extension is for the talents to train themselves after they achieve the academy. Company need them because they are well qualified employers. I don't think the discrimination should exist in the job seeker. I think continue with the OPT extension is keep the legal immigrant door open to the very hi-tech talents who really contribute the country in turn. What's more, the OPT extension will definitely not conflict with the citizens but to help them because with the better economic and fair community, there will be more opportunities.
