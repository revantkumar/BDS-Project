I strongly support this rule. I believe the 24 month OPT STEM rule will benefit the economy of US dramatically, and makes US a more competitive and attractive country.

In my opinion, OPT STEM will not prevent US citizens from obtaining enough work opportunity. For non-STEM areas, OPT STEM does not apply to international students at all, which means the work opportunities available to US citizens in these areas will not be reduced at all. On the other hand, in STEM areas, although OPT STEM allows more international talents to work in US, it will also increase the absolute amount of working opportunities to US citizens in the long term.

United States, as a country built by talents from all over the world, is currently the most creative, most productive and strongest country in the world. This is due to its open policy for importing talents, regardless of their citizenship. People with extraordinary skills are the key to improve the power of the country and push the development of the society. This is especially true in STEM areas. A country without rapid economics increases will never have enough energy to create sufficient open jobs in the market, making the country less attractive to hi-tech workers, thus slowing down its development even more. This is a negative feedback that both US citizens and international talents do not want to see.
