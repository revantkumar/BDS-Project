Hang Huang OPT extension would definitely benefit U.S, both in short term and long term. As a new computer science PhD graduate who is currently in OPT, I would be happy to share my story and stories around me. Most of my international students went to high-tech firms in California bay area after graduation, even though those high-tech firms set the bar really high(I believe many guys have heard about the crazy Google/Facebook interviews). These young professionals are highly valuable intellectual assets. OPT extension provides very important chance to keep those assets in U.S. Without OPT extension, if anything goes wrong, for example, don't get the H1b VISA in one year, they would have to leave U.S. Does anybody think of how hard it would be to attract them back to U.S? It's human nature of hating change, especially when they have a family. 

I got an offer from IBM cloud after graduation, 1/3 of our team are international students with OPT. We are catching up with Amazon Web Service(AWS) cloud day by day, I would say our progress will definitely slow down if any member leaves. The new employees with OPT would most likely be affected without OPT extension.
