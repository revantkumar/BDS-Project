This is a very good appeal for all F-1 students, and also will let all American benefit from it. Those F-1 students are mainly work in some fields that American people do not like and their salary is very low during this period, maybe only a half comparing to hiring a native American person. I think this policy is amazingly good for both sides people. The students are gain precious experience, while the US citizens can spend much less to complete the same work. I 100% support this appeal.
