I STRONGLY SUPPORT OPT STEM EXTENSION. For those of you who commented that extending stem opt places disadvantages on American students, that is absolutely not correct. First of all, there are much more disadvantages placed on foreign students already. A lot of the companies only hire citizens and a lot of the funding opportunities are provided only to American students. On the other hand, foreign students pay 2-3 times as much as American students for tuition, etc. Foreign students must work much harder to have equal chances to live and work in the US. As a result, it's normal that foreign students need more time to learn, to find a job, and to practice what they learn. I thought it's American spirit to give everyone equal chance, am I wrong?

And extending stem opt is not just for their own good. Many foreign students need stem opt extension to get jobs that require high-tech skills and strong math ability, such as those in the research institutes. It's not true that American students are disadvantaged BECAUSE OF foreign students, but rather foreign students supplement on the tough jobs that American students rarely want to do. Moreover, some people argue that the US should "place qualified American citizens in these jobs". But the truth is, there are much fewer qualified American citizens applying the jobs than the foreign students. This is the reason why some people think foreign students are occupying the job market, because fewer American students are qualified for those high-tech jobs! I've interned with several companies and all I've seen is that they only hire foreign students when there's no available American students in the pool. 

See how many foreign students are fighting much harder than the American students, just to get a single chance to give what they've learnt back to the country? While a lot of American students are complaining about not getting enough pay for too much work, who are actually contributing to the US economy?
