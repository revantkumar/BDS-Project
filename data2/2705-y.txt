John Baker I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.
