I feel it is not fair that F-1 students pursuing a STEM major get revoked from the 17 month extension. We as international students abandoned our families and friends in our country to pursue a better education, paying triple tuition than a us citizen. Still, it's hard, difficult, complicated to find a job since not every company provides sponsorship or will hire a student under OPT. The 17 month extension is a great opportunity for an international student.
