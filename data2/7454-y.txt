Shalaka Gollahalli Vinod I strongly support the decision for improving and expanding training opportunities for f-1 students since being an f-1 student myself, I would like better opportunities to gain experience and exposure here in the US after investing a huge amount in my Masters degree. I deserve to explore the knowledge and opportunities here in a place which is the hub for all great companies. I would also like to help america grow using my capabilities in the field of IT.
