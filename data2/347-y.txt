Marie Thieling Yes, I support it! America was founded by immigrants. If you do not welcome these skilled kids, it's just like another way to say, "this is ours, you cant come in." I understand the need to have population control and accurate economic readings, but I think immigrants deserve to be here as much as we do. If the path wasn't so hard and expensive, they would just do it the normal way.
