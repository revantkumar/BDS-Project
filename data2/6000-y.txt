Laurie Z I strong SUPPORT this new regulation as to extend the OPT for STEM students for 24 months. It seems that most of the opposing comments are saying that international students are illegals, they are not paying taxes, and they are cheap labors. I think those statements are fundamentally mistaken for the following reasons:

First of all, the international students studying in the U.S. are all legal alien residents under F1 visa. Please DO NOT mistaken them as those who secretly crawled over the border. They arrived here, paying expensive tuition which greatly helped U.S. economy and education, and offered their talents to contribute to the job market.

Secondly, the internationals are paying taxes!!! It's true that the FICA is partially waived for the first 5 years, but they are paying all other taxes for any single income that they earned by sweat and tear!

Thirdly, they are NOT cheap labors! Those international students came to the U.S. after proving that they are top of the talents in their home country, thus get admitted into the top U.S. universities. They are the future and current engineers, scientists, mathematicians... They are the one who can help America and change its fate!!

Wake up America. Don't let the fool trick us and lose the great talent who can help us advance the country greatly!
