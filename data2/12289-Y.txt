F1-students in Stem majors contribute a lot in the world's economics development for the following reasons. 1. economics of the Silicon Valley is bloomed not only because of local American residents, but also F1 students in stem majors. Though some of them are granted green cards, most of them need the OPT period to prove their values to the economics and to the companies. To my knowledge, a lot of important positions in major companies like Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Yelp, and other companies are taken by internationally students. If they lose their legal ability to work in the U.S., the situations of those major tech companies can be very seriously jeopardized. The reason why U.S. Is so ahead of other countries in the world in the tech field is particularly because of the highly educated and intellectual international labors in STEM majors. That's what US is different from Japan, Germany, and other countries.

2. United States is a country that vales freedoms, values of life, and diversity. Banning this OPT extension policy is contradict with the core values where this country is built on.

3. International students not only brought different values and diversity in this country, also, their tuition, living expensives, transport, and their family's visit contributed to this country's business, grocery, communication, transportation, tourism, and other industries.
