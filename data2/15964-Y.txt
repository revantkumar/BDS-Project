Take a 24 month extension will allow me to get deeper into America spirit and culture. I came to Los Angeles on fall 2014. I've been here for one year and a half, but I barely hang out with others because I am not prepared well to get into this amazing America. I really want to get into this new world. Now I am getting an offer from Google. I am going to work for the most amazing and creative company around the world. Working with the most brilliant people. It really excites me. It is really the best chance for me to really know America.
