I totally SUPPORT this proposal. This proposal is going to maximize the interest and wellbeing of the States at large by Maximizing the contribution to this great country from the most talented and most competitive and productive professionals in the world. Someone might think keeping so much foreign workers here would take way the natives' jobs, but Here is the truth. The natives are born with many previllages but the foreigners have to work tail off to get the same opportunity in the job market. If the natives are unemployed, they get unemployment asistanship, which actually comes from the high tax paid by many many foreign workers. However, if a foreign worker gets laid off, what's their option? Leave the States. The fact is basically saying the States only keeps the best and most productive foreign worker in this country to boom its economy. It is surely a unwise idea to let these people go and bring their knowledge and expertise learned in the States to another country, while the State needs them badly.
