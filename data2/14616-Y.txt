As a PhD student holding F-1 Visa majoring Electrical Engineering, I truly hope the Optional Practice Training (OPT) can be improved and expanded. It takes a PhD student 4-5 years to finish the education for the degree, and we really hope we can get some chances to combine our knowledge with actual industry practice. OPT provide such a great chance, however, current one year period is not enough for finishing even half of a project. Most projects takes two to three years to finish, it is neither efficient and nor economical to get someone else take over the project after one year because of the previous person's OPT issue. Another reason is OPT extension also benefits the US industries. STEM subjects are all significant areas in national economy. It is a great opportunity for US companies to take advantage of the smartest brains all over the world after their graduation, and make contributions to US economy.
