Tongji Wang I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am a Chinese master student majoring in Electrical Engineering and I am now have a full-time job in a top semiconductor company. I just started to jump to a new level after graduation, and I cannot believe and accept that my career life suspend because of invalidation of OPT extension rule. Also, without this OPT extension, it is a catastrophe for most all of the high-tech companies in U.S. In these companies, foreigner students, who need OPT/OPT extension as a legal working permission, take an extremely important role. 
And also just 12 months OPT time is not long enough for a high-tech project. As a junior engineer, it takes some time to get used to this new environment. When he get familiar with the projects and products and start to get involved into a new project, it is a big loss for both him and the company if he is informed that OPT is expired. So I agree that 12 months plus 24 months is a good length for OPT program.
