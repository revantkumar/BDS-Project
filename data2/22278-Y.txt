I total support 24 months OPT Extension. 

From the new data released from NAFSA: "Association of International Educators shows the economic benefits of the record-breaking international student enrollment in the United States. According to NAFSA, for the 2013-2014 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs. Compared to the previous academic year, this is nearly a 12 percent increase in dollars contributed to the economy and an 8.5 percent increase in job support and creation." Written by Paul McDaniel

International educator are not stealing American's jobs., On another hand they help to create more job opening and contribute more profit to the company they work for. As if cancel the OPT Extension, I don't I think International student would like to study in American in stead of, Europe might be a better choice who better OPT-like training plan. Besides that international student pay out of state tuition and fee, which one intentional student's tuition and fee can help roughly 1 and half American student finish their college study. Also They rent apartment and help local economy.
