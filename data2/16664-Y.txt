I do not agree with the OPT program and H1b because the abuse of guest worker programs is too prevailing. However,As a US citizen in IT industry, I do think it is important for US to retain truly talented students while cracking down those abuse

I suggest several provisions to prevent abuse:

1) very clear and high enough prevailing wage requirement for employers to recruit students on OPT
2) set up a black list of companies that abuse OPT and H1b, those in black list will be forever barred from using OPT or H1b program.
3)OPT program should only be available for students from top 50-100 US universities, the current provision "accredited Universities" is too vague.
