This is extremely good for both usa and f1 students as these highly trained individuals will be in USA adding to its economic growth. Also all f-1 students provide a fixed amount of income to the government too for the two years in masters and 5 years for phd. 

Not having an extension would only cause a sudden vacuum for companies seeking talented individuals. Also let us not forget, f-1 students are not stealing american jobs, it is unfortunate that there aren't equally qualified americans here. So until there are sufficiently well trained americans, the f-1 students should be given an opportunity to contribute back to this great country. 

As a masters student, I know there are barely any american citizens pursuing masters save for one or two lone wolves .
