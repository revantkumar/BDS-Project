I strongly support this proposed rule. The rule will attract more international students to pursue their degree in the US and get post-graduate practical training. The tuition cost and living expenses of these students are making bigger contributions to U.S. economy. Their talents in research work are playing important roles to help U.S. colleges and universities remain competitive. And the different background is making culture more diverse. This proposed rule is a wise decision.
