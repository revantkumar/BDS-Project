I totally support the 24-month STEM OPT extension proposal. To offer more time for STEM student working in USA will benefit the USA economic. And the 24-month extension is better than the previous 17-month, because some of the STEM students will apply H1B and 17-month extension brought some inconvenience for applying H1B. 24-month is a good time.
