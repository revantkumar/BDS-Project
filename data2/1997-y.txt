Evan Zhan OPT extension is really good for everything. We need high-tech talents, and we know the fact that those people need OPT are usually well-educated and will be able to make contribution to the whole country. As long as those people do something to help developing the whole industry, there would be more and more working opportunities coming up which will help other U.S. Residents. I believe it will be better to approve the proposal for OPT.
