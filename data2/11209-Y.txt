I strongly support the OPT extension because it benefits the U.S economy in the long term. The OPT extension attracts the most talented students in the world to come to the U.S, to not only just finish their study, but also to leverage their talents in the fields in science, technology, engineering, and math, and help U.S to stay in the leading position in the world. This is the essential purpose of this policy.
