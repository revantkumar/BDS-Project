Jia Wang International students are making huge contributions to the U.S. Every year, H1B holders pay more than 27% and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people.

It is well known that many American companies are global companies and sell their products/service to all of the world. International students can provide the owner of companies with a good opportunity to have a better understanding of the culture, history and customs to help business expand and grow. It is also to lead to stronger growth in the U.S. economy. 

Rejecting international students seems to reduce fewer competitors in the job market temporarily. However, STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries, and they will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for.I believe that the American dream attracted people from the world to come to America many years ago and made huge contribution to the American development. What is the American dream? It is Democracy, Right, Liberty, Opportunity, and Equality. It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in the U.S. after graduation simply because they are not citizens.
