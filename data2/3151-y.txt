Timothy Bermudez If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM. Based on the experience of last few decades, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields. They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world.
