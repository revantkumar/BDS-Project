I think the 24 month OPT extension for STEM students is such a good thing for America.

1. It will make the giant company like Amazon, Google, Facebook more stable, since these companies have lot of foreign employees that with the F-1 OPT status, this plan will benefit them to make the employees more stabilized, since those giant company make a lot of revenue and out put so many taxes per year it will benefit the local and federal government as well. 

2. It will benefit the US for another way, since those people amount is large, keep them in America is benefit to local economy as well, since those people must rent or buy a house, a car, shopping, and eating. It is a great chance to enhance the local economy and bring more people to working position not only for foreign and also for the American citizens. 

3. If this plan got approved, more ace student in the foreign country might want to go to US for a study, because as you can see the regulation right now, it is more and more harder to got a working visa right now. Once it got approved, more ace student might more willing to go to US for better education and working environment rather their home country or UK. And it will benefit the US a lot, because there are more and more very talent people in US rather than other country, it will make America stronger than other country in the world. Since those people's chance to get a working visa is not that high, it will not interfere the citizens working environment as well, those people when they finish their 3 year period they must leave US. 

As all above, i think this plan will benefit the US from many perspectives, and it will not only the government more and more richer than before but also it will let the giant companies more stable to make more profit. It will make America more and more stronger when this plan got approved.
