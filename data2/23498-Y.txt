The extension of OPT will definitely increase the development of economics of America.

My friend Jerry is working in a software company but he didn't get the H1B visa successfully, which resulted that he must come back to India with 3 mouths. This is a big loss for both of his company and himself, because the company spend a lot of time and money to cultivate him from a new graduate student to a engineer who can work in the real world. And if Jerry leave the company, what the company have to do is to hire a new graduate student for the job vacance, which may possible suffer the same fate like Jerry.
