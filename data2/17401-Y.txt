Talents go where they are appreciated. You either accept them, or lose them.
Let us be clear, it's the US universities that invited those students here. They need all these contributions from internationals especially the public ones. You cannot expect they pay a huge chuck of tuition to US and then all of them would leave right away. 
These are talents, they study, stay and make contributions. By the way they do pay taxes. This country was and is being built by immigrants. In my experience I have never seen a company would prefer international students over citizens. And despite all the rights citizens have over these international students, they still cannot land a job. What does that tell you? You DON'T have the required skills and the industry NEED them.
It's simple, you have two choices. Number one, oppose this ruling which have potential effect on thousands of skilled workers that actually making this industry running. Number two, accept the fact that this would benefit both the students and the US economy. While students have their opportunities and citizens would also have theirs. Otherwise, US lose its attraction to these young talents and they go somewhere else. Then it's only going to be a matter of time they'll have their own silicon valley in East Asia. And after that, when the american industry lose their edge, everyone would be out of their jobs. Just like the automobile years ago.
