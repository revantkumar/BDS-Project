The core impetus behind the Optional Practical Training provision is the bizarre notion that there's a shortage of STEM workers in the United States. There most certainly is not, as a 2013 report by the Economic Policy Institute concludes (see "Guestworkers in the high-skill U.S. labor market" by Hal Salzman, Daniel Kuehn, and B. Lindsay Lowell). 

If there is indeed a STEM shortage that requires students with special training, why wont these mentoring programs be available to Americans? 

In the end this is about unenlightened self interest. American companies wish to lower costs by employing people who originate from countries where the GDP per capita is a fraction of what it is here in the United States. 

Short-sighted greed is undermining the long-term strategic interests of our country. The United States will be in sorry shape when it no longer has the know-how and workforce to lead the global economy.
