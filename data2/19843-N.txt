I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 

The expanded OPT program will:
Allow most participants to pay NO money into Social Security or Medicare;
Take hundreds of thousands of American jobs and hand them to foreigners; 
Fail to require employers to pay the prevailing (usual) wage. 

And it is not available to Americans!!!
This is a slap in the face to ALL Americans who are trying to make a better life for their families.

Do NOT expand this program!
