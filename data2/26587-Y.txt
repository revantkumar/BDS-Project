I strongly supports the extension of the OPT program. 
The new proposal will help to introduce high quality people into the U.S economy, which will help to improve the growth of the local economy and improve the technology. Extending OPT will help to enlarge the industry that can hire thousands of hundreds of people instead of the limited industry that already is full with the people. In the long term, this new proposal means that it will help the U.S economy to gain more high quality people with advanced degree. 
If we do not extend the OPT program, and people who work against it think will help to improve wage level. The higher the wage level, the higher the CPI and the higher prices the consumers will withstand. Therefore, take U.S as a whole, this will make the people who are under the average level to be poorer and make their life worser.
Therefore, it is very important that the government propose the plan and allow OPT STEM people to be able to work longer than before. They will generate wealth for this country and they also pay a lot of tax for this country even if they are not the citizens.
