Sally McLaughlin I do support this new rule of 24 month of OPT extension. After living in a college town for 20 years, I witnessed how the economy of this town is benefited by students and foreign workers. Above 40% of the students in this college are international students, they paid tons of tuitions and spent a lot on living here, which drives our economy. Some of them will work with OPT for a couple of years to polish and enhance their skills. They have contributed so much to this country, it is unfair to suddenly deprive them of the right to working and living here. Those who oppose this rule claimed that they are taking jobs from them. Well, those people shall really think about how to stay competitive in the job market. Those not competitive enough still can not get a good job even though they drove the students out, only hurting the competitiveness of the country.
