America is the land where dreams can come true! By introducing OPT STEM extension, F1 Students can contribute the knowledge that they learned from American universities and give back to American society. When their OPT extension ends after 24 months, they can bring American values to their own countries. 

Also, more OPT extension time means those students would spend more money in America, more rent for American landlords, more travel expenses, more airline tickets....

If America is not welcoming foreign students and be a closed society, I feel that it's starting to falling apart and will lose its competitiveness against other countries in this world.
