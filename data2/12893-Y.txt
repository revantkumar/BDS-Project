I strongly support the extension program. Having more students with advanced quantitative degree would significantly improve the technology and engineering industry. Those highly sophisticated students have been doing critical work for the U.S. Employers, which is beneficial to US economy. Not granting them the extension would reduce their chance of staying in their positions and thus interrupt the operations of thousands of technology companies. As an employer, it makes more economy sense to hire the best person, instead of the person who is an US citizen. I think this extension is going to be a great pump to US technology and engineering industry.
