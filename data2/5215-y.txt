According to the NAFSA datas. The 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to 2014 NAFSA findings. This is a 8.5% increase in job support and creation, and a nearly 12% increase in dollars contributed to the economy from the previous academic year. link:http://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Impact/Data_And_Statistics/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/
Even all the 886052 international students got a job in US. that's only 0.27% to the total population of US. How could this tiny number compare to 8.5% job creation?
