I agree upon OPT extension. 
Technology is the key to maintain leadership in the world for US. The creative people working in high tech companies guaranteed US having such advantage in technology. For years, thousands of STEM students graduated from advanced program like master or Ph.D and employed by these high tech companies. It is them that not only help US high tech industry grow but also contribute more than 1 trillion GDP annually. If these people can't find a job here, they will go back and join competitors of US, which will hurt US eventually. Therefore, by keep these people, US can keep some most talented person and keep leadership in the world.
