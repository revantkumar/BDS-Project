Don't know why so many think OPT will take their jobs. Foreigner can only have the job when there is no americans apply for that job after publicly announce that position and needed skill for several months. Americans always have the priority in job market. 

On the issue of salary, hiring a american is always cheaper than hiring a foreigner in the same position on STEM. That is why so many small company do not support foreigner's work visa. 

In STEM, skill is always the most important issue. Why should a company pay more to hire a less skilled foreigner to work on a same position when a local citizenship employee can easily handle. Only when the foreigner has a very unique skill that no american citizen can replace, that foreigner can be hired. 

My words can be verified easily by seeing the documents for H1B when the foreigner apply.

STEM experts are extremely demanded in anywhere in the world, but because of they receive the education in US, so students hope to exercise the skill they learned in a more familiar situation. 

Those foreigners who get hired in US are always be very skilled worker and their positions are not interested or applied by americans. 

Therefore, I am personally strongly support this new policy.
