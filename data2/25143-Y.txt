As a F-1 student in the USA for about 3 years, I do hope the opt will extend, if so, F-1 student will use what they have learnt to creat more value to the USA and bring USA to a high level. F-1 student need practise in companies in the USA, they need to apply what they have learnt to their jobs. Listen, F-1 studnet won't take away US citizens' job, actually, they will creat more jobs to the US market. For example, as more F-1 students have a job, they need food, apartment, vehicles and so on. Those things gives US citizens great opportunity to creat more jobs, also, we bring intelligence to the USA to make USA more powerful and more greatful. I think with contributions we bring to the USA, both F-1 studnets and US citizen will benfite a lot.
