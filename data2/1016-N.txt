I have no clue as to where your priorities are other than giving employers money to hire foreign students over America students who have to pay their tuition, graduate with a degree, have massive debts from college loans, can't find a job and are passed over because money kickbacks from the taxpayers and SSI will go to employers who hire the foreign students. One must wonder where your thinking process comes from and where your loyalties are.
