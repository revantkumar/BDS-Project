I totally agree with this rule for the following reasons:
1. Study doesn't end in college, industry is also a learning place. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. Foreigner students also deserve a equal opportunity to practice their skills after graduation.
2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in Engineering area, and that's also a reason why Silicon Valley can become a so creative place.
3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
