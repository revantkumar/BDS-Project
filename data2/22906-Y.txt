I really support this new proposal, and I hope it will become reality in the near future. As an international student, my dream is to working in the U.S in which I can find great opportunities. International students work hard and study hard, and also they have great potential contribute to U.S development. Standing from U.S government's perspective, it definitely worths to invest effort help international students who have outstanding abilities and desire to help U.S economy. Therefore, I totally support this proposal.
