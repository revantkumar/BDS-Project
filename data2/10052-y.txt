Xiao Wang For people who are claiming internationals stealing their jobs, please look at this comment. 

International are not only not stealing citizen's jobs, but also helping creating job opportunites. 

When the companies hire people, priority has already been given to citizens because it costs more to hire an international. International students are not even considered/interviewed if there are enough citizens. So don't worry about jobs being stolen, we don't even have the opportunity! 

The only chance that we gets considered is that there are not qualified citizens, or we simply need to show that we have way better expertise than the citizen candidates to get the job. It is already so hard for internationals to find a job. If this rule is not approved, it is even harder or even impossible for some people! 

The brilliant international students get hired and even help to create more job opportunities. The companies benefit from hiring brilliant people and the business get better, so more jobs can be created! We are making much more contribution than you think. 

I strongly support this rule. Truth has showed us that U.S. benefited from attracting smart people from all over the world to help keep its leadership position!
