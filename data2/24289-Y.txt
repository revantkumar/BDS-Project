I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. US is a powerful country as for now, but with the time passing, we can see that other countries also try their best to develop so much even some of their growing rate is higher than US. So giving more time to STEM students indeed help increase the competition of USA.

2. USA is not a insignificant and shallow sight country. Only give more time to STEM students to train their skills, can they indeed contribute their unlimited potential power to USA!

3. USA is a diversified country who accept different people. We can see that a lot of CEO is came from other country, a great number of excellent employees are came from foreign. USA has to acknowledge that absorbing the different elements can help country to become and keep in a better, comprehensive, full of energy and creation in the world!
