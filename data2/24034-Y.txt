Previously experience demonstrates that STEM students could create more profits for the companies than the local people. If those students are ruled out from U.S. companies, there will be a big shock to lots of boosting companies, e.s.p. IT. Moreover, those people are a big gift to Chinese/Indian/Other companies, cuz they have both knowledge and experience. 

More STEM students -> U.S. lead the Tech in a relatively cheap way -> wealth grows faster->more expense->more opportunities for all, including local people;

otherwise: Kick STEM students back to China or India or other countries -> U.S. Tech got caught up -> less sale -> less opportunities for all, including local people;
