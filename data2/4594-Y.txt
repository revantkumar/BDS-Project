"A NATION WITHOUT BORDERS WILL COLLAPSE."
I have come to believe that our open borders Immigration policy is short-term oriented and very selfish...

I have been studying population and environmental issues for over 25 years and have come to believe that for the US, for other countries, and for the world the most humane and environmental tact is to HELP PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE and to not encourage them to migrate.

Migration to the US increases our own very unsustainable and growing population level with its devastating local and global environmental impacts, relieves us from training and hiring our own many low wage workers, holds our wages down while new jobs bypass citizens (verified by BLS), takes pressure off of source countries to deal with their own population growth and related environmental and economic problems, and draws away from those countries the very people who are most likely to be leaders in their native lands to help improve conditions. Some countries have asked us, in fact, to better enforce our laws to help them better their own conditions. We must set an example of authentic sustainability and stop being selfish.

It is only the biggest US corporations that benefit from high immigration. Everyone else loses.

Population is the great multiplier!
