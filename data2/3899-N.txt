What is wrong with giving our American students as much a chance as some
foreign person who isn't even a citizen. 
It seems that our government is doing everything in its power and bending
backwards to give everyone who has no love for the U.S more education and
benefits then our own people. I am sick and tired of this government of
ours and its misfit operations.
