Eileen White We should give international students 24-month OPT extension. As I always believe, international students are an opportunities, not a cost. Engaging with these young minds from other parts of the world enriches our visions. This comforts our students to stay with people from other cultures. This teaches us how to respect. We should have their people to help us move forward.
