This new regulation doesn't impact the American citizens in anyway. Because it enhances the economy of US. It relatively increases economic activity in US. Only the individuals who had opted to choose H1-B will stay in US and others will return to their country.
Any company will hire an individual only when it trusts the capabilities of an individual. If a foriegn with no skills will not be employed by any company. If that individual poses skills he/she might get a job. And this is no way threat to local american citizens. Because the demand for jobs in STEM is higher than the americans who had degrees in STEM. This factor made the US companies to hire foriegn students.
The unemployment rate of US citizens who had degrees in STEM is very low. There is no way to fear for reduction in wages. Because if a company hires a standard employee, it will have stronger financial stregth and their country poses a financial economy. With these avaibale new foriegn students under this policy, there will be huge business activity in the country. If companies in STEM gets stronger then companies of Finance gets stronger then the country gets stronger. This is an inter depedent relation. 
Then these students pay taxes, pay for food, pay for rent etc. They are going to make this nation economically more stronger. This a give and take relation these students make US stronger economy and make themselves financially stable when compared to their position in their homecountry. Americans no need to fear about this new law. 
If business activity goes down, economic activity of the country gets weaker. I strongly support this law.
