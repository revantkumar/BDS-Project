I strongly support this proposed rule. I think it should be 36 months instead of 24 months. The F1 nonimmigrant students can use their talents in the company.Our country spend a lot of money in foreign students.We should retain these high skill workers rather than drive them back to India and China and let them compete with us. This also make our country be attractive to the smart students oversees. We should be open minded!
