To be clear at first, I support this proposal for solid reasons. Let's not say the economical benefits F-1 non-immigrant students can bring during their longer period of study and job seeking like rents,food,tickets even uber, just think about the progress which has been made in technology and science field in American in the past few decades and the reason behind. If it were not for the better training opportunity for F-1 students, many of them would probably choose another college to study. 

Furthermore,globalization is not a notion only shown up on news.It is a fact that everyone should face.The action of seclusion might only bring a short period of fake prosperous,at least for the native citizens who come up with very short negative comments with vapid statement and no evidence. There might be more job vacancy, but in a long run, the balance of the industry would probably been destroyed, not to say the general competitiveness in the world market.

Besides, DHS has already considered this and initiate E-Verify program,which "maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status". So looking at a bigger picture, the extention would do much more good to both sides.
