Raquel Contreras This OPT program being proposed to expand by DOHS is a giant problem affecting millions. Why is DOHS legitimizing this illegal program that promotes employers' greediness, by doling out jobs to foreign workers instead of domestic workers, thus leaving American workers unemployed while paying foreign workers much less than if an American worker was doing the same job?! I say "no" to DOHS's proposal to expand on this.
