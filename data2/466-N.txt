I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. The proposed rule will extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers.

The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule will create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student F-1 visa to leave the country upon graduation. 

The Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program's artificial expansion of the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. 

Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. 

Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against them. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
