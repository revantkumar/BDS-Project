Jialu Xu I am a top 20 university MS graduate in STEM, ever since 2 yr ago after I graduated, I am working on my OPT in a small company. Due to my hard work ( working at least 15% more of the hours than local American resident with the same job title, my boss agrees to sponsor H1B for me. And I applied for that this April, unfortunately, I did not win the lottery. Now I have to apply again for that, now since there are so many people having to apply for H1B, I am not 100% sure that I could win next year. If opt is extended for 24, some of the future international graduates will have more chance to get their H1B and continue contribute their knowledge and effort. 

Thus, I am for the policy to extend opt for 24 months.
