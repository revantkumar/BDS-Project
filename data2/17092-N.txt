I am certainly dismayed and disappointed that Homeland Security would make such a proposal to promote the hiring and placement of foreign students ahead of natural born American citizens!!!!

It is time to place our own citizens ahead of all others for any type of work.
I am positive that we have sufficiently qualified natural born citizens who would be glad for such an offer of employment!!

Additional on the job training should be given to American students and not to foreign students. Our children need any and all advantages they can get. Let's look after our own, rather than ALWAYS looking out for others!! After all, Charity Begins at Home!!!
