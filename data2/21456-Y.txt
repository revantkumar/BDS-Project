I strongly approve of this rule.
In case this rule is not passed, it will lead to a greater decrease in number of foreign students coming in country for studies.
Foreign students pay lot more fees than the domestic students, major revenue of Universities come from International students.
Apart from this, decreasing number of foreign students would just deteriorate the quality of labor in technology field.

For those native Americans majored in STEM, I don't think this rule will create any unfair competition for them. It's generally pretty difficult for a foreign student to find a job in the United States. They need to overcome the language barrier, and they still need to have outstanding academic performances. So only the best of the best among the foreign students could find a good job which doesn't care about the trouble in hiring a foreign talent.
The current situation is pretty tough already. This new rule will help fix the broken immigration a little bit. We are going in the right direction.
