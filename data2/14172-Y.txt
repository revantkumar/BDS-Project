I do agree with the new OPT extension policy. As an international student, I really learned a lot in US about how to apply the knowledge obtained in school to practice with my formal job after school. OPT provides this opportunity to me. For engineering, the best way of learning is doing it in reality, and in a complete industry system. US is the no.1 choice of this with no doubt. 

From the other perspective, it's also very good for the US industry to incorporate brilliant minds as much as possible. International students are already in a more brutal environment of applying for a job compared to residents due to the language and culture, therefore students who got a job offer must have something they are better at to provide to the industry. Why NOT the government takes advantage of this to improve the economy?
