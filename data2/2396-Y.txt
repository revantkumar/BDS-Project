To be more rational, we should support OPT extension which is beneficial for the U.S. in the long term.
It is beneficial to our education system. U.S. universities would like to attract more students whether to gain more tuition or bring in talents who will contribute to the academia. Even if those students intend to go back to their own countries, those training opportunities are valuable to them. They want gain some practical skills. Suppose students are deprived of such opportunities. Chances are that less of them would come to U.S. and choose alternatives like U.K., Canada, etc. As a result, our education system suffers: 1. some universities, particularly private ones where tuition is a large part of revenue, may have financial difficulties. How do they find alternative funding source?(donation? government?) 2. Who could guarantee that we won't lose talents like Albert Einstein?
For U.S. citizens, some may think that those students compete for resources. But, is this really the case? Foreign students contribute to the economy of the U.S., which in turn creates more jobs. We are just ignoring those hidden effects! 
America wants to benefit from these nonimmigrant students. But, really, we cannot benefit ourselves without giving them even the slightest chance to develop.
