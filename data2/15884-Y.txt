It would be great to have opt stem extension. Without OPT extension, only a third of students can stay in US with a H1b visa. Students who want to come to US will say, uhmmm, if I go to graduate school in US, I will only have a third chance to stay, I probably not going. It will dramatically affect US education. A lot of public schools are dependent on the tuition from foreign students. Having opt stem extension will benefit US education.
