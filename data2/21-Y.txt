I support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and CapGap relief for all eligible F-1 students. I believe those student possess the intelligence that help the US industry and society, also they need more opportunity to gain actual industry experience, maximize what they've learnt in school, and contribute to what they are enthuastic about. They certainly deserve this
