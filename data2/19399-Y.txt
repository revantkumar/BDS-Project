I am an international student with STEM degree, and I paid all my tution with family fund. One major reason I chose to purpuse high education in United States rather than other countries, is the OPT extension. 

With the original rule on STEM OPT, I will gain big advantage to purpuse my career in my home country after more than 2 years of practical training. Now I graduated, and will lose my chance of two year practice training under current condition. 

If there was no OPT extension, I would surely have considered other countries with better OPT policies for my further education. 

Without OPT extension policy, American education will surely much less appealing for international students. This will be a loss for United States.
