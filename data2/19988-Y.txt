I strongly support the proposal because it can reduce the cost of u.s. companies when they hire excellent international students and help them to keep talents. U.S. companies would like to hire talented international students. In most case, they pay time and money to train those new hired employee, and the training takes one year. The new employees can really contribute to the company after one year training. However, most of the international employees cannot get H1B visa within one year and they cannot work in U.S. anymore if OPT only last for 12-month. This means the companies wast their time and money to train employees, and lost the well trained employees. Hence, the 24-month extension of OPT would give the talented employees more time to get H1B visa and help U.S. companies to reduce their cost on hiring excellent international students.
