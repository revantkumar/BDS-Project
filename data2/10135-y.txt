Ruoyu Lei It is beneficial for both students and the United States generally to expand OPT period for STEM students.

1. Most students are going to work at high-income positions, which means more tax will be paid.
2. The majority of F-1 STEM students is seeking high-tech jobs. We all know how important it is for the States to have adequate number of high-tech workers. It makes America great.
3. If the OPT period were shorten, the number of college applications from overseas will certainly decrease, and will truly become a bad news for the United States education system.

Thank you.
