I do support this regulation. After reading some previous comments, I can't stop to say something. This is my first comment.

(1) Currently, about, 10,000 international workers(including me) are benefit from STEM (17-months)regulation. They are not unequally paid, their average salary is much higher than American's average 10,000 is not a great number, these people is not a burden of United States, in contrast they are mostly working at higher level position and benefit American economy and American people.
(2) Most of group of STEM employees are mostly well educated and from mid-high level families from their home countries. Higher Education is US is expensive, only students from mid-high level families from their own counties, they are not parasites of America Society, their country bring their best people to get educated here, currently are paying tax and insurance, working in high-tech department of small- big company. These people is one of the keys to keep united states to be the best country in the world and to be the nation has most advanced technology and science. That's what make United States to be the best country in the world, it adsorb most great people around the world. Not great on number but great on the ability and contribution of these people.
(3) 2-3 years is the best time to be most productive in their work, let these people go the a great lost to American economy.
(4) The number H1B visa is remain intact, so OPT workers won't able to stay here forever, don't take them as a threaten to United states.

I will be very grateful if someone could read my comment, thanks
