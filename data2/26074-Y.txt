This new rule will greatly reinforce the strength of American high tech workforce, and benefit both employees and international students of STEM major. More qualified workers for high tech industry is, undoubtedly a critical component of innovation powerhouse. Actually, if you look at what percentage of university professors and high tech startup founders are foreigners with an advanced degree in STEM field obtaining from high profile US universities, the benefit of this new regulation definitely speak to itself.

I do understand some of the concerns about jobs, but those concerns are misleading, because the so-called "cheap foreigner workers" mainly comes from outsourcing companies like TATA and infosys, which came here directly from their native country without any education experience in United States. That should be a separate issue to be addressed and has nothing to do with students obtained degree in United States.
