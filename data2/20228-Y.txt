Finnally this is coming :-) I was a F1 student myself and benefit largely from the 17month OPT extension. After gratuated with master degree , I didn't know much about job market, the OPT extension open me a door to internship and then my first industrial job, without needs to worry about working visa ( as you might know, H1B is a often a lottery, no guarantee you can get one) . 

Now I have a decent job I love, with people I care, and working forward to become a perminant resident. None of these would be possible without the flexible OPT period. 

So please, make this happen, sooner the better.
