I am a graduate Civil Engineer with 40 years experience. I strongly oppose the proposed OPT Program. The US produces adequate numbers of STEM workers annually and the numbers are increasing.

The OPT Program is being promoted by employers such as Microsoft, Disney, Facebook and others because they know that if the supply of STEM workers is increased the cost of those workers will decrease. It is simply a the law of supply and demand - increase the supply and the demand is reduced. Once the demand is reduced in the case of employment, wages are depressed. This is good for the bottom line of the corporate world but bad for the US citizens who have worked their way thru college and would like a decent standard of living.

Once the demand for STEM workers is reduced by increasing the supply and the wages are depressed, then the numbers of US students entering these fields of study also drops. This is a never ending cycle that must not be allowed to continue.

Having worked in the engineering field my entire adult life, I believe I am qualified to state that we have an adequate supply of US citizen STEM workers. I am strongly opposed to increasing the number of foreign workers utilizing this program.
