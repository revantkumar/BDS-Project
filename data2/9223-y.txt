Madhuri Bhamidipati I support the STEM extension rule (24 months). The International students come here to pursue their higher education with the expectation to graduate with flying colors and to end up in a job through which they can pay off the loans taken in their homeland. It would put all the International students into lot of trouble in case they have to leave the country after the completion of their education. It would be great of the extension rule is accepted as the students would be given a chance to showcase their talent and in turn pay off their loans.
