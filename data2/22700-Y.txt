I strongly support this extension due to the following reasons:
Historical records show that F-1 students have made huge contributions in the innovations and ground breaking researches. These contributions are one of the fundamentals to the U.S. economy. Not only does the contributions from F-1 students boost the job market, but also lead to a much more prosperous and robust working and living environment. Take a look on the CEOs of Microsoft and Google, they are all once F-1 students. They were within the category claimed by other Americans that these people will harm our economy. But in the end, they both proved that they can contribute to the economy and so to the country. More people get hired because they lead their company to further growth. This example is, in my eyes, a firm and strong evidence that extending the OPT will only benefits the country further more, not dragging the country down. Please do not forget that United States of America is a great country that embraces the diversity and the talents. It is because we embracing these elements that makes the country great, not because of embracing protectionism. The F-1 students are not asking for an immigrant status. There are laws that forbid students that are holding OPT to get green cards. Therefore I do not see a strong reason to decline their proposal. All they are asking is to stay here for a little longer and contribute to this country. The extension of OPT is crucial and we shall not forget what makes this country great.
