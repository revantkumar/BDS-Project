William Peng In my opinion, this OPT extension rule is greatly beneficiary for American academic institutes, high-tech corporations and local economy. 

OPT without extension program will make America lose tons of talents all over the world. If this extension rule is finally disapproved, most of STEM students will choose other countries instead. The high-tech corporations therefore will also lose its horse-power in new products innovation and the academic institutes will face unmeasurable shortage of research scientists as well. For those college towns where economical and civilization prosperity for a long time depends on those international students, it will bring great negative impacts shortly. All these will instantly impair Americas economy and moreover cut its competiveness in globalization in long term run, as are what America cannot stand. 

If this OPT extending rule is approved finally, it will attract more STEM international students, which will instantly boost Americas economy and further sustain Americas leading role in scientific development and industrial innovation. Therefore the whole America are the biggest beneficiary of the extending rule.
