foreigners are not big competitors of domestic students. In my university computer science department, domestic students are all already find good jobs and it is very common that they have several offers from big techs. Therefore, even though foreigners are not allowed to work in US, how can our domestic students benefit from that, more offers? This is actually true for many universities in US, therefore, even if US is not allowed foreigners to work here, the unemployment rate for CS students wont drop a lot.

if extension rule cannot pass, I am 100% sure that there will be a huge drop in the application to US universities in the next few years. By observing the large proportion of foreign students in each university, I am wondering how much revenue the universities are going to drop. Subsequently, how many people work in these universities may lose their jobs because of it. The overall unemployment rate may probably go down. Moreover, foreign students are powerful consumers. They need to rent apartments, purchase furniture, and so on. The big drop in application to universities will probably make those businesses, which largely depend on students go less profitable and even break up.

During the OPT period, international students can gain most valuable experience from industry which gives them a huge benefit when they go back to their countries to continue their careers. Also OPT policy makes it possible for tech companies to hire enough excellent employees. It's a win-win game for United States and international students. Most projects on tech companies take more than one year. Without the OPT extension, international employees most likely can not even accomplish a complete project for their companies before they leave. That will be a big loss and trouble for those companies. There's no hurt, but so many benefits for US to provide the OPT extension.
