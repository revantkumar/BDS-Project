I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.

US invites many STEM students to US to get higher-education degree with full or partial scholarship. US actually is doing an investment because most of benefits can only be harvested in the next few years after graduation. Then after graduation, the government said you immediately get out of here and contribute whatever you learn to other countries. If this is true, then 
there are totally no benefits of US.

Many Americans think this reduces their job opportunities so they don't like
OPT. They think in a wrong way. Because even if this is true and
US do not like this effect, they should abandon their current policy in 
enrolling international students instead of the policy after their 
graduation. Because after graduation, the investment cost is already put 
there, the game is already started and now in the middle, without a good 
working policy, most of cost cannot be converted to benefit in the end.
