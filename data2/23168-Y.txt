I strongly support this extension. As many projects ask more then one year to complete, shorter OPT extension will means companies will have to hire less qualified people which substantively impair US competitiveness around the world. Then the whole meaning of OPT will lost right?

Also three years opt period can supply useful work experiences for STEM students. And after they come back to homeland, the first job choice would undoubtedly be US companies in their country. Again this will largely enhance the global influence of US compaines.
