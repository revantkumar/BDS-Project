I strongly support the proposal. 

As a an international student working for Panasonic Avionics on OPT, I think I need three or four years to contribute to the project I'm working for. I'm developing android SDK as a software engineer. One year is just enough time for me to get familiar with tools we are using and core development, and then I will use my experience to solve tough problem and improve myself. If I'm only allowed to work in America for one year, the company spends money and time to train me but they can't get retribution. It's unwise to let me go.

Secondly, many customers of Panasonic Avionics are Chinese Airline company, our company need some Chinese developers who can understand Chinese. Because our company develops in-flight entertainment system, we need to deal with subtitle and sound track of movies, PA and so on. I remember I helped the tester to find the bug because they can't understand Chinese.

Last but not the least, I don't think international student make the employer reduce the salary and let native employee lose their opportunity. To tell you the truth, our families are not poor in China to support our education in America. And as STEM students, we can earn high salary in China too. If we can't get good salary we will go back to China to find a good job with high salary, and we can get united with our family. All of my schoolmates who are working America on OPT earn more than 85,000 per year.

In sum, OPT extension is really meaningful for America's companies and economy. I must support it strongly.
