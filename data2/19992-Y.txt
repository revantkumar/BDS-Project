International students have contributed a lot to the growth of the technology industry over the past years. Without them, tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple won't be able to grow as fast and provide the services as they do now. The number of STEM graduates who are US citizens is not sufficient to satisfy market demands. Not letting international students stay in the US will not get more US citizens employed. And even worse, this might lead to some smaller companies shutting down due to the lack of workforce, and thus even further reduce the total number of employments in the States. Therefore, it is crucial to provide the opportunities for international students to stay here and contribute more to the US.
