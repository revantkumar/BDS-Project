Lei zhang At frist, I Strongly SUPPORT the proposal(Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students) following reasons:

Fistly, the goverments shold give students opportunity to keep making contributions to the U.S by using learned knowledge, because shorted time intership cannot make large contributions for the U.S and also students are't able to use whole of knowlodges to build and service U.S.

Secondly, I am a engineer student. as my point,I want to use my knowledge to creat new and convenient things for world,but this is needs time.

thridly,The U.S is not like other country. it is a diversity culture country. I believe every famous person in here who is a interntional student.

At last, I want to say competition exist everyday,but no one is a bad thing. if there are no cometition, where we can find new innovatation. on opposite,international student taking jobs of American citizens with low salary.we do the American citizens who do not willing to do, or job which employer temporaly cannot find people to do.

As a great Steve jos said before, if there are enought industrial engineers in the U.S, he could't move factory to China.
