I strongly SUPPORT this STEM extension proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S., and many scientists or engineers from foreign countries who has made significant contributions to the U.S. were students in U.S. universities.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Without competition, the development of science and technology will be slowed down significantly, and thus will hinder the development of the whole society of the U.S.
