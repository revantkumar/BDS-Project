Elizabeth Marshall International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. If this rule is not passed, foreign STEM grads will take their skills and education to their home countries, costing America the opportunity for job-creating innovation. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM.
