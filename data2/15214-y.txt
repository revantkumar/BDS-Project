Richard Haydn As a 30 year veteran of the I.T. industry I am appalled at my governments decision to promote foreign "students" in the STEM workplace in lieu of our own citizens. I have worked with many foreign born support personnel and programmers over my career and certainly harbor no ill will toward them and can appreciate their aspirations. However, I am tired of reading stories in the press about U.S. born programmers having to train their foreign replacements before being laid off. This is a sham with the obvious reason for the proposal being the 15% savings in payroll tax obtained via hiring foreign born workers. 

There is NO shortage of qualified STEM workers in this country. If there were a shortage, wages in the field would be rising rapidly. They are flat. The notion that Americans "don't have the skills" is pure bunk. 

The business community in this country have shown a zeal for shipping our jobs off-shore in order to make a greater profit. 
This move will simply decrease the incentive for American students to enter the STEM fields. Sooner or later the policy makers will realize we cannot all work for the government.
