Dear DHS Associates,

Thanks for preparing this rule and making it happen. It is beneficial for both our international students and US technology/engineering firms. First of all, the new 24 months STEM OPT extension will add more working/training ability time for us without a H1b working visa. This will help us better understand the job market as well as related study fields after graduation. Secondly, companies have no concerns loosing all those STEM majored talents if they didn't get H1b working visa thanks to the new proposed OPT extension. Finally, this new rule will also attract more international students to pursue higher degrees in United States, which is beneficial to the education diversity and enlargement.

In general, I am in support for this new rule based on the above mentioned benefits.

Thank you!
