Hello DHS,

This 24 month stem rule has been boon to all the hard working students who have come from different countries and work for the companies here. Its such a blessing to both foreign students as well as companies here, who both get equal opportunities to grow where students, foriegners as well the IT economy of the us country. The opportunities are marvellous for each foreign student that we learn lot of work , exposure to different people and work atmosphere. The growth and knowledge technology wise is so good that most of the other countries dont provide. I think both ways foreign students earn a lot by this when they work as well us earns a lot of revenue inviting lakhs to students all over the world. Cancelling the extension or any such thing would just simply be loss of revenue for the country which is a lot and miss out the growth of both the other countries as well as US. This was by far the best thing happened to all the people who live here from different countries which makes USA home to everyone and makes more people want to be a part of it and grow with the country and well as help it grow.

Thank You
