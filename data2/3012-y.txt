Hui Wang I strongly support this rule. Due to this rule, the high tech companies in the US are able to take advantage of those foreign talents to contribute to the GDP of US. It will be such a huge lost to cancel OPT and OPT extension, because it just means for US to send all these talents back to their homelands after investing so much on their education and training. It was immigrants who contributed a lot to make US the country it is today. It is so shame to see so many Americans totally forget this important point and being so hostile to foreign workers today.
