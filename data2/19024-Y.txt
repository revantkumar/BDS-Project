Respected Regulation authority members 
As an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2013 with a master's degree in the field of Biochemistry and molecular biology. Currently i am working as a scientist in field of biotechnology where i am a part of team , developing diagnostic kits for the cure of human diseases. Without the availability of a STEM extension, when the H1 visa filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.In this scenario, i really need stem extension from 17 to 24 month so that i can apply for H1-visa 2016 and keep contributing for the welfare of humankind and represent USA on the map of world strongest economy by becoming part of USA. Changing temporary immigration policies, by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. 

Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.

Sincerely 
Pooja.
