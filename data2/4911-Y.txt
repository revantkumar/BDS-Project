I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Diversity is very important for the U.S, it is because of diversity, elites from all over the world come to the U.S work and make contributions. This proposal shows the welcome of our nation to allow more students to come to study and stay here contribute to our nations' development. Beside, the tuition and other revenue that STEM students bring to our country is huge too!

Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.It's a healthy stimulation that can make all people work harder to improve skills.

All in one, we are together to make our country better and stronger! Please consider give the STEM students this opportunity!
