Shujun Ou, Michigan State University I strongly support this policy for several reasons. In the economic point of view, making the OPT policy longer could significantly reduce the need for training new workers, and hence reduce the cost of per hiring. The US economy will benefit from the growth of such industries. For creativity, senior workers will always be more creative than the junior workers, for they have been involved in their fields for years. Junior workers have a lots to learn and will have less time to think about inventions. It's necessary to have working experience before creative outputs. Moreover, foreign students usually represent the most intelligent in their countries, which is almost a guarantee of creativity for these talent people. Having them working in the US will allow them create things in this country, and derived patents will eventually make the country out-stand from other countries. Thus, lengthening the OPT time will eventually make the STEM industry more cost efficient and actively productive. 
Although it will create competition for the native STEM people by allowing talent foreign students staying longer, this is the way to bring up the overall population quality. Without competition the country will just immense in satisfaction and soon will be surpass by others. History has given us several of such examples. Blocking talent people out is not the solution of saving the native worker, but education should.
