Haozhou Wu I strongly support the extension.
I am an Electrical Engineering graduate student.I went to the U.S. to persue my master's degree bacause this is where I think I can get the best education. I would like to work here. With the extension, I could have more work experience and at the same time, I can make contribution to USA. It's a win-win solution. We international students are not taking job opportunities from Americans, because few Americans work in this field. One the contrary, we are making contributions to the economy.
