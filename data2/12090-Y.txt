OPT is a significant factor attracting international students to come to US. US is a multi-culture country, encouraging different opinions in academic and industry. With more international students, US society will be more vigor, which in turn will stimulate the development of academic and industry.

The extension of OPT will bring much more international students and workers, which will definitely stimulate the economics in US. They pay rent, taxes, insurance, etc.

Chinese are good at doing research and project. But most of the projects last several years. If international workers don't have enough time to complete the project, it will be a great loss for US companies.
