Jacob Kennedy We do know European is once the leading region in the world and is still now a tech center of the world. But how they does not evolve any Company like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. There might be a lot of reasons behind this. However, not getting the best people might be a very serious reason.
We are country that are based on immigrants. No matter it is the first British people across the sea to settle this country, or German scientists in world war II includes Einstein, and John von Neumann, or todays entrepreneur includes Elon Mask, Satya Nadalla, they pushed our country a big step forward. Now imagine, after the elites of their company travel across the world travel this far to our country receives the best education in our country and being excellence in engineering and technology, but they have to get back to their country cause we dont allow them to stay here, what a loss! The truth is, they probably not going to consider being here at the first place since they would not be able to stay. 
If Abandoning the OPT Expansion, American are driving away students work in scientific and technology just like German drove away Jewish People including the famous scientist like Albert Einstein and Lise Meitner. I am not sure how long will it be when The United States be the leader of high technical industry.
