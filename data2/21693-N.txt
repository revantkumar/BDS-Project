If the us supposedly needs the foreign students to alleviate a STEM shortage why do these students need training and mentoring? Why are these programs not being made available to Americans? U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad over an American grad with the same skills and salary................WHAT ARE WE DOING???????????????
