As a foreign technical worker now on OPT, I strongly SUPPORT opt extension in the STEM field. As a skilled engineer, I graduated from college last winter and have started my opt and work for my current company. The project I've been working on in our group it's a long-term project that takes years. As I didn't win the lottery this April, I would have to leave the US next February without finishing the project. It's going to be a big loss to the group as I own the intellectual property for this project. The company is seeking solutions to this situation now, and I believe I'm not the only case. It would bring big loss to technical companies in the US once the OPT STEM extension is cancelled and talented workers leave the US. 

Also Foreign students contributes a lot to the education economy in the US. Most of the foreign students come to US are STEM majors and they come to study because the country's open policy towards foreigners. Once the STEM extension is cancelled, talented students won't want to come to the US for college and US education is going to lose a big amount of foreign students and their tuition.
