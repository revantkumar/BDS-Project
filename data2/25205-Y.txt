you can not deny that most students in STEM major are foreigners and the reality is most company they know these foreigners can work better and harder than Americans. this is a simple choice that the employers made, they made their decision based on the performance and the greater good for the company, which is they need to find someone qualified to do the work. although Americans are good enough to do work but still can not statisfy the whole econmy. Still need foreigners after all.
