Xuxiang Wu I am a father of an STEM student I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

The United States forms from Immigration. It is built up by the European immigrants, which is a typical country of immigrants. The United States is a multi-ethnic country, with the racial composition of 68 different countries. The reason why forms this multi-ethnic situation is mainly due to immigration. Of the 3.2 million people in the United States, there are only 4.1 million people are the descendants of the real so-called American Indians and Alaska Native people, accounting for only 1.5% of the total population. From the beginning of discovery of the New World in late 15th century, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Britain and other countries began to immigrate to North America. From then on, it opened the door of US immigration. It cannot be denied that without immigration there would be no United States today.

The United States is the world's most powerful nation. Its power comes from strong economic, cultural, educational, scientific and technological progress. The progress cannot do without high-quality talents. And it is good immigration policy that attracts highly qualified personnel around the world coming to the US. The OPT bill is one of the most powerful policies to attract outstanding scientific and technological personnel to serve the United States, to promote scientific and technological progress, to create wealth, so that the United States can maintain its vitality.

If this bill can not be implemented, it will make more and more talented people disappointed, and then flows to the countries that are more attractive. That would lead to great talent loss in the US, and even worse may lead to loss of its leading position in the future.

Those Americans who oppose OPT bill are just the descendants of immigrants. If there is no immigration policy, how could their parents come to America?
