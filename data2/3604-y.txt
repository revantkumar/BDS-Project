Brandon Bernal I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The U.S. Universities provide great knowledge for the international students. They gained not only knowledge in U.S., but also America culture. It is a good choice to let them have chance to make contribution for the development of USA.

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Lots of people are afraid that international students may threat the opportunities of the native americans. However, this is not true. First, most of my STEM native american classmates are very competitive comparing to other international students. They do have their own advantages in the competition. Second, companies are also willing to hire native americans as I know.

3. The proposal is providing a good environment for both international students and America companies. This definitely has a good effect on the technical development of USA. I believe this is a good thing for all the people in USA.
