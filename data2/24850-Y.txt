I strongly support this rule for several reasons:
1. I believe that the American spirit is to have everyone living in U.S.A. enjoying the same chance no matter who they are, and where they are from. 
2. Talented students deserve more time to gain their experience to practice their skills after graduation as the international students. 
3. To think about this program from an economic side: U.S.A will attract more students studying in relative fields if they can have a longer OPT to gain their experience in U.S.A.. And this move will brings a lot of financial benefits for all the universities as they attract more international students.
4. It is also good for American economic development to have STEM students to have work in their own fields as they can be valuable for international cooperation.
