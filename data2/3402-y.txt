Wei Jing This improvement of OPT STEM has a significant benefit for US economy and technology development, which has been demonstrated over past several years. High quality international students have been providing large supports for US companies and institutes by using their unique skills and knowledge, especially in the STEM areas, such as science, engineering and mathematics. Meanwhile, those positions in STEM areas are not the interesting area for American people. It is can be inferred from the gradated students in STEM areas, where international students have a very large portion. Therefore, international students won't complete the US people in STEM areas for the job positions. Additionally, it is more important for US universities to get more international students enrolled for graduated programs by providing longer working time to them after graduation, which definitely can increase the innovations and quality for science and technology development, in turns, will greatly benefit US economy.
