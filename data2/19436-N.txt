I am against expanding or even keeping the Training Opportunities F-1 Nonimmigrant Students program in any field, especially in STEM degrees. There is no need for further glut in a market that has proven to be overwhelming full of people willing to take positions or displaced in positions by H1 and F1 people. One of my sons was in college and had started to get a degree in information technology. He changed majors after he saw what business' were doing firing the staff that had to train their replacements. My other son wanted to be a chemical engineer but also changed his mind after talking to many people in the field about job possibilities. There is no place in this country for politics to be displacing the citizens and legal residents that want to work with programs that make unemployment worse. The facts tell a different story than the reports from business that there are not enough people to do the work. They should not be able to underpay F1 young people to keep from paying the Social Security Tax and Medicare Tax other employees require. If they do not have to pay the taxes then the requirement should be that they must hire and pay a tax of at least 10% or higher to off set and that should be put into the Social Security and Medicare Funds that loose money from all those that can not find jobs because of the program.
