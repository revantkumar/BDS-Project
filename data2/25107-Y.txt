I strongly support this policy. I am the one and only foreign employee in our firm right now. We are always running out of people and the principals made the decision to recruit more foreign students based on the truth currently it is hard to keep the pace of new hire every year with citizen graduates only. For a rehabilitative economy, foreign students in STEM major are a good resource for small engineering firms. I think this policy is on the right path. It is beneficial not only F-1 students and engineering firms, more importantly, and the reason it was made for, this country.
