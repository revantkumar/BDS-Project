This is my second comment. After reading through those objecting OPT rule, I think it is necessary to point out a fact regarding a complain most American folks talking about: Are foreign worker/international student taking jobs from American workers?

Based on the facts that I know, They are not

When I did my job hunting as an international student, the first question I got from those companies I applied to is always "Are you US citizen?", And in most case, they don't want to move forward when my answer is NO because only a few companies sponsoring H1b and it is not wisely to hire someone with this request because they are doomed to leave within one or two years,which is the maximum of current OPT. 

So actually companies are always taking American applicants as their first priority, which could save their money and lower the risk of re-hiring someone else. How could you say that those second priority persons are taking the opportunities from the first priority? I can fully understand that someone standing on the opposite side of this rule have some difficulty to find a job, but please trust me, it is not because of the international cheap labor you mentioned.
