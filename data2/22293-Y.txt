The OPT STEM extension is very important policy for both F1 students and employers.
Retaining students with advanced degree in STEM can definitely promote the technology and engineering development in the USA, boost the economy in high-tech field, and contribute significant amount of tax to the government. History proves that the technological immigrants have made significant contributions to the USA. The government immigration policy should lean to these group of people.
This OPT STEM extension also does a huge favor to employers who intend to hire high level STEM background people. Currently, the U.S. job market is still short of candidates with strong STEM background. Allowing those fresh graduates to legally work longer in the U.S. will make companies recruiting much easier.
