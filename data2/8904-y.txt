Patricia Visconti Definitely, I support the extension. I feel so sad that some people oppose the rule just because their ignorance. They claimed that the foreigners are smarter than the local people and will rob their jobs.Please face your weakness and work hard to be more capable! Even the extension pass, the citizen still have huge advantages when searching for a job, unless they are too stupid!! If the extension does not pass, and a lot of talented foreigners are pushed to go back their country, it will benefit their country a lot. As a comparison, high tech companies here in United States will have a hard time recruiting people/ American's economy is counting on high tech. It will will suffer a lot in the future, if it pushes those hard working foreigners with high tech to go back home today.
