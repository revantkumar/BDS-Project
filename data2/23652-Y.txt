I am an international student working with OPT and I firmly support the propose of 24-month OPT extension. 
The most important reasons that I chose to get a master degree in the United States rather than other countries is that I would have the chance to practice what I learned in the very same country for more than 2 years . Knowledge is dead without practice. When I say practice, I mean enough practice, not the practice in one year. People can only get a glimpse of an industry in a single year, which might not even be helpful enough for them to make a simple decision for their career. Furthermore, I was sure that I would get at least 29 months in total for OPT and OPT extension. My rights are being injured as a consumer of the education of the United States. And thousands of international students are in the same place as I do. When we talk about America, people think of the saying 'everyone is born equal' The laws and policies should be made to protect the rights of every people. The rights to legally work in the United States , at least for current international students holding OPT, should be protected.
