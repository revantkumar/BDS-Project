I totally support the proposed law for OPT extension. Firstly, the extension will give a fair chance to the international students to gain practical experience in the field they have acquired the education in US. Secondly, numerous silicon valley companies stand testimony to the fact that these international students who have acquired STEM education in US have proved to be an asset for them as employees and infact have held very critical positions leading to the progress of these companies and hence leading to the scientific and technological advancement of US as a nation e.g Google. Thirdly, these international students brings in a multitude amount of money to the US which the government can utilize. The student fee for international students in all the universities, including public universities is much more than the in-state tuition fee. Increasing the STEM OPT duration would enhance the money flow further.Fourthly, best of the talents in different countries in the world look upto US for quality education as such the students enrolled in the STEM courses are among the best of the talents of the world. Extending the OPT duration would mean that the US gain more from the intellect of these talents which may otherwise look upto some other country for pursuing the education in case the OPT duration is an issue. This would mean best of the talents going to a different nation which would not be in the best of the interest of US as a nation, as a global leader.
