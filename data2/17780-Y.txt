I am an international student and I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. This is not only beneficial to me as an international employee in the U.S., but also to US employers. I work in a multinational insurance company. It has a great rotation program where I rotate to another area in two years. However, with the old OPT rule, I can't even finish half of the first rotation. As a result, I couldn't learn a lot and apply what I have learned in a great U.S. university into my career. Moreover, my employer spends a lot of resources on me, such as study program, exam supper, and mentor program. If I have to leave after one year, the company will lose its investment in me because I can no longer create value and contribute to the company. It's a lose lose situation for both enoloyees and employers. With this new rule, employers can hire talented international student with more confidence. my company encourages diversity a lot; yet, with the void of former OPT extension rules, I did see a huge impact in the hiring decision of former international interns. A lot of team managers raised their concern about not being able to get their summer interns back, because they were satisfied with their performance and they wouldn't need to train a completely new person. Nevertheless, HRs talked about the turbulence of this program and said they couldn't do anything. Now, with this new purpose new rule, some of the confidence of building an extremely talented team comes back for my company. I wish this new rule can turn the lose lose situation into a win win situation.
