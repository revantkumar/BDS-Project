I think it is uttermost important for the US government to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees.

The country has already spent millions of dollars and resources on higher education and on students who have passion and the ability to apply their knowledge and make better changes for this world. It is time to get return for the huge investment. 

Besides, STEM fields are developing and increasing so rapidly. They absolutely need talented fresh blood to jump in and devote their time, knowledge, brilliant ideas and thoughts to innovate and fast forward. 

There are arguments saying this action would limit the chance of US citizens finding jobs. But I believe that competition and variety are the spirits the helps this country to have leading technologies and innovations. Best will always thrive if given chance, wherever they are from.
