I strongly support this proposal. Ten of the top 14 fastest-growing industries require significant number of talents in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)[1]. However, Americans still continue to under-perform in those fields[2]. To remain as the leading world power, the United States has to compete with the other countries to keep talented STEM international students. Extending the OPT to 24 months definitely encourages international students to pursue STEM career in the U.S., which in many ways will foster America's leading role in STEM fields. Recruiting talented STEM-trained international students will make sure that the U.S. always keep those fastest-growing industries at home, which is important for sustained economy growth. It is unfortunate that there is an emerging power in the U.S. to push forward anti-immigration agenda by targeting the OPT program of STEM students, given that what makes the U.S. the best is her openness to the talents all around the world.
