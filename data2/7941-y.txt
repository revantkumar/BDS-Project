Chen Xin Some comments saying that the new OPT extension will harm US workers is pointless. First, the new proposed regulation still requires that the company should not reduce the number of hired US workers as the result of hiring F1 students. So the existing jobs available to US workers are secured. Second, the regulation also states that the hired F1 students should be paid equally to the US workers, so the claim that the OPT program will reduce the average salary of US tech workers is unsound. Third, if there were no OPT extension program, the working forces in the science and technology area will greatly shrink. As a result, the number of product produced by the hi-tech industry will decrease and the cost will increase. The outcome would be the loss of competitiveness of US companies in the global market, which will eventually lower the average welfare of US tech workers and harm the overall economy of US.

OPT extension program gives US a strong power to keep the most intelligent students around the world to work for US. Without such a program more than 80% of the PhD students who are from foreign countries will have to leave US and the loss to US as a whole due to the lack of skilled researchers will be immense. When the whole economy boosted by the technology innovation diminishes, every US worker, instead of getting higher salary, will have to experience the economy decline and their welfare will be inevitably harmed.
