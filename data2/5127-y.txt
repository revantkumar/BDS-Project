Anthony D It is appropriate to give 24 months extension to foreign students' OPT program. Some people may disagree by saying that foreign students took american people's jobs. However, U.S. workers already have priorities in job hunting. Most companies clearly say that they only hire U.S. person in their job advertisement. I think the american people who can't find a job should think about their own ability, instead of blaming foreigners. Foreign students must be really outstanding in order to have their employer to hire them. Thus, it is reasonable to give them some chance. Besides,this program doesn't give extension time to all foreign students. Those incompetent students who can't find a job in 90 days have to leave the country. Thus, only outstanding students can have the extension time and those excellent foreign students will bring great benefits to the U.S. and create more job opportunities.
Sincerely
Anthony
