This proposed regulation does not address the lack of enforcement of current law. As such, this proposed change must be withdrawn. Until such time as the Administration enforces existing law, there must be no changes made. As a matter of concern, I find that the current "lack of enforcement" has resulted in the "abuse" of our immigration laws to the detriment of the rightful citizens of this country. As an example, Disney's firing of American citizens in order to replace them with "green card" workers was a gross abuse of the law. To allow Americans to be replaced by "green card" holders and giving working status to illegal immigrants, demonstrates that the Administration is acting in a lawless manner. The People of this Nation will no longer tolerate these abuses. I have contacted my Senators and Representative with my concerns and to a man they are in agreement. President Obama's continued lawlessness will soon be brought to an end. It is my desire that those in government that have supported his lawless behavior will receive the punishment they deserve.
