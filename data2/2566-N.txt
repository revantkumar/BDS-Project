Giving dual intent advantage to those on f-1 visa, while asking those who apply for f-1 visa to prove non immigrant intent makes the whole visa process a dumb joke and is against human rights and right to equal consideration to those whose f-1 visas are being refused in their home countries.

The first change to f-1 visas and OPT is to provide clear guidelines about dual intent for f-1 visa applicants or provide stricter guidelines for rejection using 214b and limiting the 214b rejections only to cases without proper background scores and those attending non reputed or universities where more students violate their visa conditions.

Please update f-1 FAM with clear guidelines for dual intent and against rejections using boiler plate text of 214(b) before extending any benefits to f-1 students.
