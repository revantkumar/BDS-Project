Joe Rumsey I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of
payroll taxes. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified
Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after 
completing their degree. With millions of recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide 
companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
