I am an American citizen and I am working as a Manager in an IT company. I have so many resources working under me. Some of them are citizens and some are non-citizens and all employees get selected on base of their knowledge only. In fact citizens get more benefit in selection as they don't require a sponsorship, thus organization does not have to spend extra money to retain that employee. So I don't think this rule is harmful for anyone. These non-citizens are genius talent from other countries who work for our country and improve over all productivity of our country. I think they should be given a chance to make their status permanent in US. That is why I support this rule.
