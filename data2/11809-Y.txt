Our company have some OPT students. They work hard and make great contributions to our company. The values they created for companies like ours are significant for the United States. I support these talented colleagues can stay longer to work with us. Also the payment of tuition and other expenditure of international students enhance the U.S. economy. With the international students we can get more chances to collaborate with other countries and U.S. can remain competitive globally. The advantages to improve the Nation's nonimmigrant student programs are obvious.
