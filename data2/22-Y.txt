I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally compared to other countries.

2. U.S. companies needs more STEM people,however,number of current STEM graduates are lower than demands.For example, I work for a health care data analysis company.50% people are STEM majors.If they don't have OPT to give them time to get work visa, they have to leave the company. Then the company will be impacted a lot.
