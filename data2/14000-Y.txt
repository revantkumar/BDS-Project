I believe this extension would be better for technique development of many areas in United States. Since the early extension is 17 months, which holds a lot of technique employees in STEM areas in US. This leads to a great development of those areas in US. If the extension is 24 months, undoubtedly it would make more excellent students working for companies in US.
