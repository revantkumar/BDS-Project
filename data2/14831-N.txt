The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.
It will destroy opportunities for & dishearten Americans & immigrants who lawfully obtained permanent residence and continue to perpetuate the cycle of poverty for Law abiding citizens & legal permanent residents.

It's an assault on the rule of law & the moral obligation to care for & prioritize first the American people & law abiding citizens.

Encourage discrimination in the hiring process & reiterating the first point of destroying opportunities for American people

Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.
