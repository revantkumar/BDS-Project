To whom so ever this may concern:

I really appreciate the effort that DHS is making to benefit both F-1 students in STEM majors and employers in the U.S. The 24 month OPT extension and the Cap-Gap relief are very welcome changes. And I understand DHS is making every effort to have a final rule take effect prior to February 13, 2016. In the event, however, that a final rule resulting from this rulemaking does not take effect before the vacatur of the 2008 IFR, then there will be a gap for the people who are currently using their 17 month OPT-Extension and those who have pending applications for OPT-Extension. I was wondering if DHS can still accept applications during the 60 days grace period after Feb, 13, 2016 and extend the legal stay in the U.S. for those people I mentioned above. It will mean a lot to those people and their employers.

Thanks,
Xue
