YAO LI I strongly support this proposal and here are some reasons. First, international talents make a significant contribution to the United States economic and society, many of startups start at the side research projects of the international students during their course work, and the extension could help them have more time to improve their research result to the industrial process, and can increase the employment opportunities in United States. 

The extension also has positive influence for the companies, many STEM positions relate to research and development, which need a relatively long training time, and OPT can provide this opportunity, if OPT has not enough time, the company may have the risk losing important team members during midway of the project, it will have very bad influence for the company. 

Third, OPT extension will have no impact on employment opportunities for American citizens and residents, because this policy only apply for the STEM students and according to the statistic of American Department of Education, STEM related professional staff is still a shortage, so the extension will not decrease the job opportunities to American citizens, but help to provide high-quality talents in related fields.
