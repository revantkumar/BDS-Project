It is extremely short-sighted to say that the proposal will hurt the US workers and the US economy. In fact, this proposal will create more valuable jobs in the US thus positively contributing to the US economy. After carefully reading the proposal and giving it lots of thoughts, here's why I believe this proposal is a better protection of the right to work for the US workers.

1. Companies who hire F1 students DO NOT pay them less. The proposed rule clearly states that the companies have to not only give equal pay to the international STEM workers and similarly-situated native workers, but also provide a complete training and performance evaluation program to the student using their OPT. For example, if there were 2 qualified candidates and one if an F1 student while the other is an US citizen, the company would still hire the US citizen because it'd pay the same but requires less paperwork, effort & time. Therefore, the US citizen's right to work would still be protected by this proposal.
Companies could save a lot of time and money by hiring native workers, but they have never stopped hiring more international students because not enough US workers have the required STEM skill set.

2. F1 students create jobs instead of taking away US workers jobs. Studies have shown that the international students are more likely to work on patent and R&D related jobs, which would open up more career opportunities in the US in general. That is because many STEM international students have been involved in scientific researches in their universities, which prepared them well in the patent and R&D jobs in the industries. The said technical jobs are often linked to the commercialization of new products, as well as new energy and novel materials development, which in turn require much more manpower. Therefore, the proposal is beneficial to the US workers as in creating more jobs in the US.
