I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, STEM talents probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.
