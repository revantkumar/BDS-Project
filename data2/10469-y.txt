James Placke I believe these visas for foreign students is being misused. Our government is lying to us because no matter what party they are in bed with the crony capitalists. American workers are being replaced by foreign workers with less experience at lower wages. This is especially true for the high tech areas such as engineering jobs where there are 100s of applicants for each job. Stop lying to us and stop this nonsense!
