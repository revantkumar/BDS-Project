I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.. Specifically, it will be a great loss for the US. government if students got PhD degrees are forced to leave the U.S. just because they can not get an extension of OPT. 

2. Secondly, diversity is very important for the U.S.. A lot of great people who achieve great contribution are international students and they all requires OPT in the beginning of their stay.
