Stop the insanity. I oppose the OPT proposal put forth by the Dept of Homeland Security for many reasons.

1) First and foremost, this does nothing to protect the interests of the citizens of the USA. 

2) It incentivizes large corporations to hire non-citizen workers because they become exempt from payroll taxes. This directly promotes the underfunding of Social Security and Medicare for US citizens

3) It creates a situation that disadvantages US citizens in competing for these jobs because this proposal makes it cheaper to hire the foreign worker by an average of $11,000.

Promote the welfare and security of the citizens of this country. Do NOT PASS OPT
