For those negative comments. Complain your government and international students will not solve your unemployment problem. You are in fact say NO to your country's technology and economic development which is against yourself too. You never know how much work those students do, how much value they create every day and you never know how the technology is taken over the world. If you insist to be a loser and wait for other people's mercy to give you a chance to work, then you are probably not able to make it. Because this world is always for the strong ones. Face it or continue hide yourself behind the title of so-called american citizen.God bless you.
