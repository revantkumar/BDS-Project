Jerry Callaway As a business man, I truly support the rule which allows foreign students to work for several years after graduation. Below are news from LA times. "The U.S. is a hot destination for big-spending tourists, setting a new record of $168.1 billion in foreign visitor spending in 2012. The country last year welcomed 66 million foreign visitors, whose spending represents a 10% increase over 2011, said Rebecca Blank, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The greatest increase in visitors and spending came from countries with a burgeoning middle class, including China, Brazil and India." "Long-haul foreign visitors spend an average of $4,000 per visit"
The longer time foreign students will stay at the US, the more chances that their parents and relatives will visit the US. The travel and tourism industries are going to create over 1 million jobs in the next decade.
