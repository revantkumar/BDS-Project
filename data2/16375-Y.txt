The benefits of extending OPT for F1 students include:
U.S. can hire more competitive employees;
As a immigration country, it's beneficial to keep a multi-cultural environment;
By keeping good people in the U.S., they won't be able to contribute to their mother country, which may be competitors against U.S;
F1 students received education in the U.S, and they are willing to stay and make a contribution here.

Therefore I strongly think it's a good idea to keep good people here. Therefore OPT should be extended.
