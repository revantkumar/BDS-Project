Tom Rydesk Strongly support the rule!! The rule will bring great benefit to the U.S. International students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to NAFSA's latest economic analysis.

For every 7 international students enrolled, 3 U.S. jobs are created or supported by spending occurring in the following sectors: higher education, accommodation, dining, retail, transportation, telecommunications, and health insurance. 

The economic contributions of international students are in addition to the immeasurable academic and cultural value these students bring to our campuses and local communities.
International students:
Build bridges between Americans and other nationalities;
Bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs;
Support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework, making it
possible for U.S. colleges and universities to offer these courses to U.S. students; and
Support programming and services on campus for all students by paying out-of-state
tuition, funded largely by non-U.S. sources.
