I strongly support this proposed rule. The OPT extension can obviously benefit both US economy and those students. For the US economy, those students who got well educated and have more advanced knowledge are strongly needed. And to be honest, this isn't harmful to the local labors since all the companies which support those students must have more than enough sources for US citizens who want to get the jobs according to this proposed rule. 
On the other hand, this rule is very good and fair for the students. Since they come to US from various countries thousands of miles away, if US just let them go back in as short as only one year after they graduate, there will be fewer talents and smart people who want to come to the US. US will hurt a lot because of losing these genius and talents. 

So I think we should support this rule not only for the US economy but also for not losing potential talents and geniuses.
