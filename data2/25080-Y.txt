I strongly support this proposed rule for STEM OPT extension. This will expand training opportunities for F-1 students who can apply their academic knowledge learned during program into practical experience, while also contributing significantly to US economy. There is ever increasing demand for highly skilled STEM graduates in USA hi-tech and science industry, This demand could be filled by STEM students while they are on OPT. Companies don't take any F1 students just because they might be a cheap source, but solely based on the student's merits and experience (whether an international or national student). OPT is the means by which companies and students, both can explore each other to fulfill their respective goal. For students it would be to get the practical training and mentoring experience that can be used later on when international student goes back to his/her country after completion.
