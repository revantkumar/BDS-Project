As a reminder, the STEM students have made tremendous contributions to the country. They also pay their fair share of taxes. They also paid their college tuition (and they cannot enjoy the in-state tuition). Also note that in technology industry the hiring bar for citizens and foreigners are the same. The fact that the technology industry needs so many foreigners is an indicator of insufficient qualified citizens.
