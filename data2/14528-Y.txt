I strongly agree with this proposal. I live in Sunnyvale and my 2 tenants work for Google/Linkedin with OPT since they graduate. They have decent job and pay their rent timely. It's a great idea to give give those people extension as they're making great contribution to the local economy. In addition, they're paying way more tax than average. I don't see why we shouldn't keep these people longer in our country.
