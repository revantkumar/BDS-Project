Lingjia Deng I support this proposal. The purpose of providing OPT to international students is to provide working opportunities in a short time in the US. Among the international students, those who are excellent to find a job here will definitely improve the US technology and subsequently economy in a long run. I believe the US government tries to do the best for providing opportunists for excellent international students, and OPT is one of such benefiting policies. However, such introduction of talented students cannot be guaranteed if the OPT time is too short. First, though interview process in the US is good and mature, it still continues to be improved over the years. An ideal interview and hiring process will choose the best students, but as we all know there does not exist any perfect thing. A too-short-time OPT cannot provide enough time for many excellent students to prepare well and be hired. A 12-month period actually includes several holidays. The interview for an IT company may take two or three interviews. It may take several weeks for HR to proceed to the next round. And, it takes more than one month sometimes to send the offer letter after the final round interview. Current OPT is too urgent for an INTERNATIONAL student. Second, the specific project of a job position cannot be guaranteed to any employee during the interview process. If an excellent student finds a job and after a few months he/she find it is not quite the right job, a longer OPT gives him/her the opportunity to change a job. At least, more international students will spend more money and contribute more to the US economy if the OPT is longer. In short, I think a longer OPT is more attractive and more reasonable for the US to provide opportunities to TALENTED students all around the world to find their BEST positions in US.
