First thing first, I strongly supports the extension proposal. This proposal is multi-beneficial for whoever involved in.

America has been leading the world in science and technology for a century, and the fundamental reason is that genius guys across world are were attracted to America, by its friendly and open policy to foreign talents. Without the support of such foreign talents, the America will be no longer the country that we are proud of. Imagine the America without Sergey Brin, Satya Nadella or Jerry Yang, the country will be a Beatles band without Joun Lennon. Those tech giants who build the very ground of the country, such like Google, Microsoft and Facebook, are made possible by thousands of foreign talented people. Abandon the opt extension is just blocking the possibility for future Googles and Facebooks. 

Also, it is by nature reasonable that students have the chance for hand-on practices after their graduation. Actually the opt has been a major reason that international students consider America for their higher education. Why will they tolerate the high tuition and living expenses if they have to leave the country shortly after the graduation? It would be a dramatic loss when the opt extension if terminated. 

Furthermore, every American people will benefit from the opt extension, in indirect ways. The cheap gas, food, made-in-chinas is not for free. They are endorsed by the power owned by the country, and that is indeed the contribution of high tech companies. Abandoning opt extension may look good for now but definitely harmful for the long term.
