Yunhan Chang Well, this new rule is quite welcome for international students and it will definitely benefit their academics.

But I think there's should be more clear rules regarding the mentoring part. It's hard to supervise some companies in this aspect. So I believe a more clear rule is definitely needed.

Thanks.
