Linna Bao I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. The reasons for why I support the new rule are stated as following.

First, the OPT extension will help U.S. universities remain globally competitive by improving their ability to attract foreign STEM students to study in United States. The OPT extension is almost the most important factor when choosing U.S. for their further study according to foreign STEM students I know. Those students, especially given the fact they are studying in the fields in science, will make contributions to U.S. academic sector through their study as well as their practice training period.

Second, international students have been making significant contributions to U.S. economy, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures. For instance, the apartment I am living in currently have a lot of international students as tenants.

Third, STEM students who enrolled in the OPT extension program help U.S employers improve their diversity for ideas and backgrounds from people from all over the world, which will keep the companies remain competitive in global market.
