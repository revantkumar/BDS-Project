Our country must stop the efforts to get foreigners into jobs here, and instead those efforts should be to get our citizens into the jobs. In the not so distant past, the tech companies put $50 million dollars into getting more work visas. This money could have been better used to make and support programs for U.S. workers and college graduates. I believe it was in the 1930s the U.S. had a tight labor market, low immigration, better pay for the working class, and companies would have apprentice programs to get their hires to be trained the way they wanted them for the industry they were in. Once a person is in a job, they take the basic skills they came with and expand them to job specific skills as they learn from their job.
