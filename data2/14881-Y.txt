i don't think OPT has anything to do with "taking jobs away from Americans" cause OPT is just a temporary permission for international students to work here. It's really a filter which allow us to keep those who has the talent. If an International student who's working via his OPT is doing badly at his work I'm sure he is not going to keep the job for long and no job will be "taken away".
