Max Yu I strongly support the OPT rule expanding the training opportunities. It is definitely beneficial for US economy in many ways.

1. With expanded training opportunities, US tech companies can work with STEM students with highly educated background and creative minds to solve most challenging industrial problems. The innovative work done by the STEM students contributes significantly to US economy and helps US companies competitive in the global market. 
Without this expansion, we may have to send these talented students back and US companies may become less competitive. 

2. Expanding training opportunities will encourage foreign students to come to US, which is a great boost for universities and US education system. With enlarged international student body, universities not only get more tuition to improve the education quality but also become more and more competitive in academic and technology area. 

3. More students will come to US because of the expanded training opportunity, which itself significantly stimulates the recovery of the US economy. Just think all these students will spend a lot money during their duration in US, which creates many additional job opportunities for local US citizens. I live in a small town in PA and I witness the booming of the town because of the expansion of a local university. More resturants and supermarkets open since the community become more and more vibrant with international students. 

I cannot imagine what if the rule is not passed. The US universities will become much less attractive to international students. The US companies will suffer a lot since there will be a significant shortage of the highly educated man power. 

Yes, we may save a few jobs from international students by kicking them out, but we are putting our economy at risk by neglecting their talents, skills and also the buy power.
