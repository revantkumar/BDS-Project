I support this OPT extension scheme wholeheartedly. An important part of OPT is to consummate learnings with praxes so the students can go on to change the world. One year or below in no way constitutes sufficient practice, and the book learning will be to no avail. Let's perfect the OPT system so that it provides international students with adequate training they deserve so they can change the world for the better. Arguing otherwise would be myopic and unfair.
