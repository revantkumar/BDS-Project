Bryan Winn STEM - OPT program is great, it has worked for a lot of organizations to hire great technical talent across industries. It should definitely be renewed and extended to 24 months. The idea behind the program is good but it has major holes and no transparency at all. Here are suggestions:
1.Who is responsible for the OPT - EAD holder: the OPT is given based on the college masters or PHD and the College should be responsible for OPT-EAD holders actions.
2.On-JOB trainings - These trainings should be well documented and presented along with EAD applications, not only should these trainings be validated but also audited against the Degree / Diploma of the OPT EAD applicant. 
3.Oversight - EAD is issued by USCIS, this is a special extension only given to STEM degree holders, so EAD should only be extended to the applicants who are working in the same field / technology as their STEM education. 
a.E.g.: Electrical Engineer who is working as IT Business Analyst or QA analyst is not a valid STEM EAD extension. 
b.E.g.: Biotech engineer working as Software Engineer or Java programmer or SAP developer or QA analyst is not a valid extension. 
c.E.g: MS in Computer Science performing as SAP consultants or WebSphere Developers or MQ or any other technology have to prove they learnt the skills in MS or they were trained by authorized and certified Training institute, not a training / body shop out of Sulekha.com website advertisements. 
4.H1b Application: OPT - EAD applicant often apply for H1b visa, their visa should be tracked back to the degree and OPT validation. 

There is no oversight to flag these extensions and this cannot be acceptable.
