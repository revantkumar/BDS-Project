This proposed rule is very necessary for the students. They spend thousands of dollars to get a degree in STEM fields and they deserve a chance to gain some professional acumen in this area. The OPT will help them stay here and work. This will prove to be beneficial for both the host country and the student. USA will gain skilled employed workers who have studied here and want to contribute to the society and community here. My friends, colleagues and me gained a lot from this OPT extension. I want the government to support this rule wholeheartedly.

Most people who receive an OPT apply for a work visa (H1B) and eventually a green card. So the skilled labor stays here. But if you turn them away, just after they graduate, you are turning away the potential technical workforce of this great nation.
