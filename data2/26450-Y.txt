The improved STEM OPT extension rule will be beneficial to both students and employers. Students will get an extended opportunity to gain the necessary hands on experience over different projects. Employers in turn will be able to retain the talented employees and help in newer research and innovation thus boosting the economy. Also, employers will be able to open up more opportunities helping in reducing the unemployment rate.
I fully support the improvised STEM OPT extension rule!
