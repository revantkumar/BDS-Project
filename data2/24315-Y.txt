I don't understand why some people are so unreasonable.
I support this extension. My son is in college and he always tells me how amazing his foreigner friends are and how much they have helped him to obtain success in academic. So it's a good thing to extend the OPT to attract more brilliant, creative international students to study in this country. And that's what makes this country improving and continuing being the greatest country in the world.
