I strongly SUPPORT this new rule of OPT for international students studying hard in STEM majors. America is built by IMMIGRANTS! Even those people who criticize this ruling cannot deny that. Competition is always the reality. People who try to avoid that lose. It was always the fittest who would survive in natural selection for thousands of years, according to Darwin's theory of evolution. It is simply a supply/demand economic principle: not enough US talents/resources existing to support the development and expansion of US businesses in various fields. While at the same time, international students come to this country carrying confidence and expectation in the world-class higher education here. They also look forward to utilizing what they've acquired to give back. Opportunity is for everyone. Everyone deserves a chance(even not equally), regardless of race, gender, religion and nationality. But the best one is always for those who are most prepared and valuable. It is not "who you are" that matters, but "what you are capable of". The improved and expanded OPT program will be covering more students who are capable but lack of chances after so much investment in their US education. It will also relieve the pressure of H1B program in which tons of petitions are submitted each year resulting in random lottery drawing that creates too much drama and tragedy. Overall, the continuance and expansion of STEM OPT creates more opportunities to the businesses and people as well as benefits to the US economy. We've seen that for years since 2008 and I believe we'll see more of that in the future.
