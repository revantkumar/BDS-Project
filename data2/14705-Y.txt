I strongly agree with the OPT extension rule for international students. Personally, I'm now a Master student major in Computer Science. Last summer, I finished my internship at an IT company in San Francisco bay area. Before coming to U.S, I have many options to pursue my master study, such as U.K, Australia and so on. The most valuable thing that attracts me to graduate school in the U.S is the OPT and its extension for STEM major students. Not only I, but also lots of my friends come to U.S for the same reason: take full advantage of STEM OPT and gain industrial experience and be more competitive when come back to our home country. The salary we earned is not less than other interns and we all plan to go back home after our OPT extension.
To this extent the most profitable side is U.S. Firstly, U.S institutions can take use if the OPT to attract more international students to study abroad and only a small portion of them will finally stay and earn internship after graduation. Moreover, most of them will finally go back to their home country, if they gained experience in U.S, they can be more competitive in home country job market and the better do outsourced business to U.S companies.
U.S as well as their institutions already earned higher reputation among other countries. At least lots of my friends chose to study in U.S and pay high tuition and fees, in order to earn a degree as well as a internship chance. I think the extension of STEM OPT can better attract more international students.
