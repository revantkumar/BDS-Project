I'm a strong supporter for this initiative. I don't think the tentative rule will be the key factor to affect the job market in US as people argued that it would negatively affect the employment rate of US citizens. If the international students are not qualified, who will employ them and who will even care about their legal status in US? I think the only reason they are very competitive in the market is because they are qualified and they are also open to any competitors. Therefore, I don't think it's fair for a country who pursuing human rights, equality and freedom to set other kinds of barriers to prevent people who have dreams to work hard in this land. Besides, I think US needs the competitions to grow and to further develop.
