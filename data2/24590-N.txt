I object to expanding any influx of nonimmigrant foreigners due to the problem of illegal immigration that occurs all too often when foreign students decide they don't want to go home.
There is no real enforcement of U.S. immigration laws when they are disobeyed and it is much better to not let possible illegal aliens on these shores in the first place.
Additionally our nation is in a huge debt crisis and I prefer our limited funds be spent on Americans and American students before foreign nationals.
