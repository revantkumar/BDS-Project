United Stated should definitely extend OPT for STEM students. A lot of young and talent people deserve a better chance to stay and work in the U.S. Especially in those stem subjects. That is also what made it becomes a greater country. If It even refuse to give those students work opportunities, I can imagine a lot of talents are going to be lost and this country is gonna go downward in technology advantages.
