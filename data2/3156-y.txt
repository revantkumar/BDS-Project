Sihan Yu I won't hesitate to support this new policy, not only because I myself am an international student with a STEM degree, but also it is advantageous to both sides. There is no doubt that tens of thousands of International students benefit from the current OPT programs each year while chasing their dreams. And the good is obvious, in return, these work hard contributing to this country and its society, bringing fresh blood to the nation's fast growing industrial systems, from coast to coast. 

International students with specific STEM degrees helped so many US based software/hardware companies thriving with the internet boom, and brought numerous off-shore manufacturing jobs back from across the ocean during economic recession, let alone those who worked in research labs and institutes leading the cutting-edge technologies that could heal the world.

Expanding the OPT program is not merely for the sake of economy growth, the diversity of the society is improved. Students coming from across the world might getting to know each other during classes while at college, but what's more important is they extend their understanding of each other through the years working together while on OPT, their experience of cooperating with people all over the world leads to a peaceful and open-minded society, which turns this country into a place where equal rights among different ethnic or cultural groups come true. 

To be frank, I tried to summarize the benefits this new OPT rule could bring to the country and the whole community of international students, but looking at the lengthy list, I just decided not to make it a thesis which I will strive years to finish. So I'll stop listing the benefits and support the new rule.
