OPT extension proposal only aims for STEM majors. As a US citizen currently studying in a top university in the IT major, I have to say that: give them a better chance by working for our country! As we all know, the big IT companies in the US contribute so much for the US economy, and there are a lot of talented IT foreigners working in these companies. This will benefit our country a lot. I have no idea why some people think this is a threat because they may lose their jobs. Actually, they are just working in some non STEM positions, but using the Google, Amazon, and Facebook productions everyday! I have a lot of talented international classmates, its really my great pleasure working with them. Im sure it is our big lose if they are not allowed to work in the IT industry in the US. As an IT person myself, I have to say that its really unfair that I couldnt work with these talented people to make our country even better.
