It is shortsighted to go against this proposal since it will benefit both American economy and also international students. International students are not the reason of the current salary level in software industry since during OPT they are mostly doing entry level jobs. Also, American Universities benefits a lot from international students. If OPT extension is cancelled, it will definitely make universities less attractive to international students.
