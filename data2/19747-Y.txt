Before doing anything else please give correct guidelines or regulations for DUAL INTENT for f-1 visa
applicants and holders.

Refusing of f-1 visa on premise that a candidate could take up a job in US in future, while allowing those already in US
to take up jobs under OPT and extending them privilege for another 2 years and stop gap and h-1 filing is a 
SELF CONTRADICTORY action. It is a violation of right for equal consideration for those whose visas are refused under
214b on premise of Immigrant Intent.

Please rectify this big biased loophole in f-1 visa application process before you take any actions to facilitate training and employment and settlement of f-1 students in USA. 

I hope to see you discuss about DUAL INTENT for f-1 visa applicants not just f-1 visa holders when you give the final regulations or guidelines. This is also in line with the President's executive action announcement in July. When it was mentioned that State and DHS would work together to provide appropriate and clear guidelines regarding dual intent for f-1 students. (But was not clear whether it is only for visa holders or applicants as well) 

Extending dual intent to f-1 visa holders while asking f-1 visa applicants to prove they have no immigrant intent is so self contradictory that the whole visa process appears like a joke and nothing more. 

I request you to remedy this incongruous situation and provide clear guidelines that are applicable to both f-1 visa holders as well as applicants.
