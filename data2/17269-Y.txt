No one can replace you if you are good enough. 
Are you sure these people can programming, design on CAD, do data analysis, and speak multi language?? Are they willing to learn?? 
I saw many local students quit the college, or just use government's tuition assistance play around in my university. One of the lady with free tuition from New York state stay in my university for 7 years, and this is your tax!
And why university are willing to have international students? Tuition, very high tuition. Local students pay 8000/year, international students pay 34000. These 26k extra can support some very good but poor local student get scholarship and have better future. One of my teammate with scholarship is from low income family, he is GPA 3.9. Do you think he can afford 8000 per year just for tuition? I think our tuition also help him chase his dream?
OPT keeps attracting students from different countries coming to this country. Universities also get more money to support research, and have better facility. 
Work hard, think different, then no one will threaten your job.

BTW:
1. H1B only requires 48-54K for most of STEM jobs, not those high salary. Less than 20% opt students get H1B. Employees from Indian get most of H1B, and they never have OPT, they are just hired by American company.
2. Also you should know company must have enough local employee to get e-verify: http://www.uscis.gov/e-verify
3. About 1% of total companies are e-verified, OPT STEM student have to work in e-verify companies to maintain valid status.
No that easy to take your job...
