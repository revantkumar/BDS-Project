United States has always been an immigration country. There will always be immigrants coming here. The only thing that matters is, who comes here. and of course, our best option is highly educated skilled workers who contribute to the U.S. economy!!!

U.S. government is investing in tons of money on all these highly educated international students for their study in United States, and after giving them scholoarships and fellowships and when they finish their higher degree of Master's and PHDs, do we just send them away???? NOOOOO!!!! You want them to STAYYYYYY in U.S., so that our investment in their education can boost our economy, by extending what they learnt in school to the real world!!! And now when they found jobs to do that, to contribute economy, they should be able to stay here and work for as long as they want!!!! In fact, we should attract these highly skilled people to stay!!! How many Phds are there any year? very very few! Yet we cannot accommodate the very few amount of Phds and they cannot get their H1B visa from 1 lottery. Of couse we should extend their OPT so they can stay here longer before they get their H1B!!!!

U.S. immigration system is broken and everybody knows it! This proposal is one small step to improve it and I will be glad to see it taking affect and more other new policies that welcome highly skilled workers to come!!!!
