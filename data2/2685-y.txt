Angelo Lan I will fully support the proposed expansion of the OPT STEM extension program. As a consultant in the energy industry who is currently on OPT STEM extension, I find the STEM extension extremely critical to my career development and my employer. Since consulting in the energy industry requires profound technical skills to understand a highly complex system, a 12-month OPT time is insufficient for a student to gain the necessary expertise. It also poses challenges for employers to develop meaningful training programs for potential talents. With the 24 months extension, students will have the time to develop skills for future career development. Employers will also be confident that the recruited talents will be able to bring in expertise and value. In a competitive global market, this program is the key for the country to attract the right talents and keep the leadership position in science and engineering.
