I strongly support the proposal. Firstly, the prosperity of US can't grow healthily without the contribution of high tech professionals. Expanding training opportunities for F1 non immigrant students with STEM can provide a solid base for a continuous supply of high tech professionals. Secondly, the support of non immigrants' working opportunity may pose pressure on the natives' employment in a short term, but in a long run, the import of high tech professionals help the continuous development of the society and creating more job opportunities for the natives. Last but not the least, open minded to diversity is very important in the American cultures. We should learn from the great person and benefit from them regardless of his or her nationality. Expanding training opportunities for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degree provides a platform for this.
Therefore, this proposal should be agreed.
