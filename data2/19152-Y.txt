Great Proposal, this gives the foreign students enough time for their training and at the same time it is also increasing the responsibility of the employers on their STEM employees. The responsibility of that employer to make sure that no US employee is affected because of a STEM employee is a good way to make sure that the recruitment was based on the increased job requirement in the company.

The concern "companies choose the STEM employees because of their lower wages" is also addressed and made sure that will not be the case. This will make the companies to choose their employees only in regards with the job requirements. 

I feel this is beneficial to the US economy, the employers and the students.
