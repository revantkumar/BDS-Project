Please refer to Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, letter to Obama detailing the OPT program and proposed rules by the Homeland Security Department of 10/19/2015.
I oppose the infiltration of foreign "students" under this Homeland security Program who are obtaining training and taking jobs from American Citizens by incentive paynments to American Employers. Our taxpayer dollars are paying for these programs without the consent of the legal American citizens.
You need to place Television ads for all taxpaying citizens to see, regarding your proposed expansion of F-1 students opportunities. Cap-Gap Relief is offensive to me. This is covert action by a Department paid for by tax paying citizens without our knowledge. I demand National exposure of this/these proposed Programs and Regulations.
