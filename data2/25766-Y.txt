-- I sincerely SUPPORT this rule, as with OPT STEM extension it is very unlikely to increase the competition in the job market for us U.S citizens or permanent residents. Instead, it can help to retain foreign talents that consumed our high education resources, and make them contribute greatly for the U.S. economy to pay back the resources they consumed. 

-- Specifically, F-1 students on OPT are required to only work on positions related to their major. For example, a Mechanical Engineering student can't take a job related to Marketing. Such high limitation excludes ALL F-1 STEM students from non-STEM related jobs already.

-- In addition, for open positions requiring STEM majors, the majority of the companies require at least permanent residency (e.g. some for national security reasons, some for saving hiring cost). This requirement rules out all F-1 students as well. And of course any government or security related jobs certainly rule out these F-1 STEM students too. 

-- Given the above two restrictions, the number of companies a STEM F-1 student can apply to is really limited. What's more, these positions are usually highly selective in its requirements by its nature (e.g. high tech jobs like Biomedical Engineering, Chemical, Computer Science), commonly requiring a candidate to have Bachelor/Master's degree or even higher, a high GPA and internship experiences so s/he can perform the expected job duties. 

-- However there's a lack of interest for domestic students to go beyond the Bachelor's degree (e.g. http://ro.umich.edu/report/11enrollmentoverview.pdf). As a result since the foreign students already used our high-education resources, we can retain them to make up the shortage of talents with the more advanced degrees. If we look at the enrollment numbers published on each school's website (e.g. http://ro.umich.edu/report/11enrollmentoverview.pdf), the percentage of enrollment for foreign students in Master's degree or above (number of foreign students divi
