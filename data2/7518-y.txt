James Paul I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. This rule provide a lot of opportunities for students which is a main attractive factor for foreign students. Without this rule, I don't believe US can still attract so many talents to contribute for the country. Hence, many industries will be influenced especially high-tech companies. Besides, foreign students can benefit local economy as they need to find a house and buy food..etc.
