Jessica Wang I strongly courage to expend the OPT period. Nowadays, even Americans are trying really hard to find a job in states, the international students only have a limited time to find a good job/internship seems no fair. We studied in states for so long, and we just want have a time or experience to work on with Americans in order to get more knowledge and cultures from states. The time is too limited for us. Business major students has to work in the real work in order to learn the knowledge. However, 12 months is just too quick for us. Please expend the opt period for the international students who worked really hard in states.
