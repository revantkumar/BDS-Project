Vivek Tummalapalli I strongly support having OPT extension for more than 17 months for the students.Coming from other countries and getting adjusted to new culture and later performing well (with more than 3 GPA) in college is not easy.Instead of making their immigration path easier it will become more tough if this OPT extension will be removed.US government can remove OPT if they can provide stable immigration status or if they can provide chance for a student to directly apply Green card after education.(So that he/she can stay in country).These tough immigration rules make the hard working students loose their interest in career and dreams by the time they get a green card.
If we don't have proper solution for this immigration issue we may soon loose students who want to come to united states for study. That is loosing revenue for united states.
