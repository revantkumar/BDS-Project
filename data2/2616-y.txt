V G Srinivas B I really want STEM OPT extension rule to continue.
I am an international student from India, did my masters from one of the prestigious universities here and now working with one of the top companies in the bay area.
Having worked for almost 2.5 years in India, came to US, to pursue masters along with gaining practical industry exposure which I consider is priceless.
But because of revoking OPT stem extension, all our dreams to work here and gain real time experience will get shattered.
There are more number of open jobs in the market than the number of people graduating from the universities, which means that our existence in US is no harm to the jobs of the US citizens.
In this regard, I kindly request you to reconsider the decision and bring the new opt stem extension rule(24 months OPT stem extension) into place so that it will be a win-win situation for everyone.
Thank you.
