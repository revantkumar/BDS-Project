As a international student in the STEM field, I strongly agree with the new OPT extension rule. If it can be effective, first of all, tones of American company can take great benefits. For example, the company I'm doing internship now is responsible for data analysis in clinical trials. I know most employees in this area will need this Opt extension. Without all of us, how can the drug be approved by the FDA? Second, it will attract more excellent students to come to the US.
