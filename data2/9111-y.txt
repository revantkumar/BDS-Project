NILAY MEHTA Immigrants are accounting to a massive 14.7% contribution to the American Economy as of 2011 which has increased by at least 2 fold by 2014-2015. STEM Extension is important for students to continue their contribution to the GDP Growth through their services and the taxes paid. I strongly support the proposal of increasing the STEM Extension to 24 months to encourage talent and innovative minds from all around the world.
