As a foreign student majors in STEM fields, I strongly support this proposal and here are some reasons.
1. OPT extension is one of the most important reasons that attracts foreign students in STEM fields to choose US universities in spite of the high tuition fee and living expense. US universities get more fund from increasing number of foreign students.

2. US economy will definitely benefits from this proposal. Highly educated employees contribute a lot to the whole industry.
