I strongly support the proposal of expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees. Reasons are listed as below.

1.Job market equals to everyone, no matter job seeker population is small or huge. Job market in the states remains relatively equal to every job seeker, the primary reason to get hired or not depends on the overall professional ability. Hence, even if the job seeker population is small, the unqualified people will still be unqualified.

2.Expanding training opportunities for F-1 STEM students will attract more international students coming and studying abroad in the states, which not only leads to cultural diversity in a good way, but also financially benefits schools meaning schools are able to afford better facilities and enrich teaching teams, which turns out to serve students better.

3.It does not make sense that companies would rather hire lower-salaried foreign employees than citizens. For the same position, there is not much difference between foreign employees salary and citizens salary, especially for STEM related positions. Since students who can meet the requirements of STEM related jobs usually have a higher education degree, as well as solid professional background. Companies wont offer qualified job seekers with lower salaries just because they are foreigners, in contrast, companies will offer everyone who is qualified with appropriate salaries because they perfectly fit the position.
