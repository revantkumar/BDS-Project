I object to the changes being proposed for the Optional Practical Training (OPT) Program. This looks like nothing but another way to push Americans out for jobs and allowing people from other counties to come here and and take our jobs. Take our jobs at a possible lower wage, the company will not have to pay income tax or social security taxes on these new workers. The SS is already in trouble and will be running out of money to pay to the people that have already payed into it. This not fair and the country will suffer for it.
