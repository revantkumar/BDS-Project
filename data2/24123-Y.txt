I am an international students recently graduated with a Ph.D degree. I am working at a position requiring high skills. I want to work here and OPT extension is very important for me, due to the recent H1-B abuse. I strongly support the new OPT rule.

For the folks who oppose OPT extension, you willingly let in millions of undocumented immigrants, give them citizenship and all kinds of welfare. They screwed up your economy and jeopardizes your society. I am working hard, paying taxes and not using any of your resources or committing any crime. USA is supposed to be the opportunity of land, and I am both confused and surprised that such a country refuses to let those with advanced degrees in STEM fields to stay and contribute. Why are you trying to push people like me out of the country? This baffles me greatly, please tell me what is going on.
