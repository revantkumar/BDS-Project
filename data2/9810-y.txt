Frank Tsao Having the extension is showing the sincerity of American being immigration-welcome country. Every year, there are millions of excellent foreign employees working at the companies which make huge impact in innovation and technologies. The tax contribution from those employees indeed help American a better place to live in. I don't understand why so many people think immigration taking American's jobs. The truth is that most of the time, those IT and high Tech. jobs requires higher degrees to fit in. Therefore, those job opening are targeting higher educated people. If you did not go to graduate school or enough a college, please stop making comments like that. What you really should worry about is illegal immigration who do not have a degree. Be reasonable please!
