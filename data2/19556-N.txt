Stop the 24-month OPT extension. It is not in America's interest. There have already been nearly 500,000 work authorizations granted through OPT between 2009-2015 in which both workers and their employers are exempt from payroll taxes. This has cost the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds $4 billion! A further problem is that employers are not required to pay the prevailing wage to OPT workers. Employers make more profit by hiring OPT workers and paying them less instead of hiring American workers with the same skills who need these jobs. This extension is opposed by a multitude of unemployed Americans and by the multitude of Americans who care about them.
