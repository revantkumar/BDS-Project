Qi Wang In my perspective, the OPT is crucial for both the students and most of the IT companies. 
For students, during the two years they can get better understand of this fascinating country and improve their professional skills. I think most of them will treasure this two golden years in their life, which will lead to a preference for the U.S. 
When it comes to the companies, the students in OPT are the most productive groups with low salary. They did most of the low-level work. Thus we benefit a lot from this kind of group.
In sum, I do recommend keep OPT.
