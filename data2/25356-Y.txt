The OPT extension will be beneficial to the United States. First of all, international students with STEM degrees will contribute tremendously to the U.S. economy by devoting to the STEM related fields, especially engineering and mathematics. Second, this rule will help attract more international students to come to the U.S and study, which could bring a large amount of revenue to the universities. During their stay here in the U.S., they will pay taxes to benefit Americans and will spend foreign capital to boost the U.S. economy. Lastly, the American culture is inclusive, open, and welcome every talented students to the U.S. We should give them more time to practice what they learnt in the American universities and thus, benefit the American economy in the long run. In addition, the employers in the U.S. will be really happy to see the OPT program extended for their international employees.
