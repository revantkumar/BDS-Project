I strongly support the OPT extension proposal for good reasons. First of all, many students from STEM discipline have advanced degree and obtained financial support from the US universities. If they are forced to terminate their practical training in a short time without contributing back to the states, it is a waste of money and education resources of universities. Secondly, the technology industry is still growing and many jobs are created every day. Those entry level openings need people to fill in. International students would not be a threat to the natives because the native applicants have way more advantages in the job market by all kinds of regulation. To reduce competition in such a brutal way is not healthy for the country. Moreover, since there are many caps preventing the international grads working longer, such as H1B cap and so on. We should not worry that those people will occupy the job market. Thirdly, stopping the extension will diminish the reputation of the states. US is always known as an embracing and open country. That is why it attracts talents from worldwide and empowers its competence. Revoking the extension is an adverse signal to the world that US starts to act conservatively and stop being open. It would cast a stronger chain effect on the reputation of our country. Last but not the least, American dream is always about encouraging people to fight for their future. It is never about depriving people of chasing their dreams.
