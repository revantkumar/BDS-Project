the newly modified policy about extending STEM related international students to work legally for 24 months is awesome if it can be approved by the immigration government. Personally, the US is a country with diverse ethnicities, which is the origin of its foundation and motivation. The American Dream is to let every one with talented skills can compete fairly in the related fields. It's because of the diversity and inclusive that shapes America as it is today. I just want to say the extension policy will greatly benefit American people, because it saves lots of talents in many areas from rushing into other countries. In the long run, it's a win-win policy for both American people and our international students.
