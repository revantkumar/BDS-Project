Allowing this ruling to pass and subsequently granting STEM nonimmigrant students like us a longer training period are crucial to many of the companies in the technology sector. A sudden termination of the STEM extension policy will cause disturbance in the U.S. technology sector as a good portion of workers who are in fact international graduates would be required to leave immediately. Who's going to fill those positions? Moreover, those who return often choose to find a job in their home countries, which would intensify the global competition that American tech companies are facing. Companies such as Google, Apple and Facebook would suddenly face the situation in which half of their positions remain unfilled for months or even years and their competitiveness permanently harmed; in sheer contrast tech companies in our countries would happily receive us and our expertise back.
Here's a word to those who opposes to this ruling: only a tiny portion of international students end up obtaining H-1 (temporary worker) visas. The rest of us are merely interested in having enough time after graduation to develop our skills and prepare ourselves for job markets in our home countries. Without the opportunity of practical training, fewer people would be interested in studying in the US; without us coming to the US for study, few would afford public universities (or even private ones) in the future as your cheap tuition comes at a cost of our outrageous 'out-of-state' tuition. Nobody is 'stealing jobs' from local workers and I haven't seen a single case where a foreign candidate is more favoured than a U.S. one in an interview. Rather than responding to some dubious Facebook campaigns and being passive here, it's better to go to your school's public library (partially and indirectly funded by us) and develop some real skills.
