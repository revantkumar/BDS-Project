I support the proposal to expand OPT for Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. It is beneficial not only for the students themselves but also for American people even for the whole US economy.

For the students, this proposal will allow them to have better chance to obtain different opportunities, to better adjust them to the US societies and to better transfer what they learned in school to the real skills they could use in the real work environment.

For the American people, this proposal will introduce the healthy and fair competition and help improve the overall qualities of the whole work force. I know many Americans would say this proposal will steal opportunities from Americans. This is simply not true. We all know that the competition is good as long as it is healthy and fair competition. Otherwise, US won't have anti-trust laws to limit monopoly. And we all know that US is an immigrants friendly country. Otherwise, US won't be as great as it is now. I am a Chinese immigrant. From the history of China, we can easily see that to close the door will only lead to be defeated by other countries. So American people should not refuse this proposal. Instead, they should support and embrace it. Instead of limiting the opportunities for brilliant and excellent nonimmigrant students and forcely saving those for American students, they should open their mind and improve the performance of the American students to make them more competitive. This will not harm American but improve the quality of the American education and the whole work force. In addition, this will lead to more successful Americans and more opportunities.

In summary, I fully support this proposal to expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. And I encourage all Americans and non-Americans to support it for all people's good.
