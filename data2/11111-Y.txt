First, I support this Rule, STEM students study Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. According to the University I attended, most STEM students are international students from all the world, only a few American study STEM major, especially in graduate school. In the modern America society, it needs and requires more and more engineering, science background talents, who can help build a better society and help America companies grow faster. It is a fact that it is very hard to hire proper and talented persons for most companies. And companies need to spend lots of labors, time, cost on hiring process. The worse part is when companies find the right international students, they need to worry about their status, because international students may have to leave no matter how talent they are because their status. It will be a big cost and waste for companies, which will slow their growth. This situation may keep happening unless talent international students can stay in the U.S. for longer time legally. So I support the new rule. Thank you!
