Victoria Williams Our company have the eastern exchange program, hire the internship and OPT student from the eastern countries every spring. They are kind and diligent people, I feel comfortable working with them. I know some of those people have to come back to their country after one year annual, until recently I know that's because some immigration policy. That's evil, why not encourage people with American dream stay here but use taxpayers' money to support those who do not want to work instead? I strongly support OPT Extension.
