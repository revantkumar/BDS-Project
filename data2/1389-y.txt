Liang Li I do support the OPT STEM extension. I agree with this policy for three reasons:

1. Student in STEM field do need longer training period due the nature of what they're study with. As student in physics field, I know how long it takes to getting familiar with the experimental equipment and lab facilities, and 12 months is barely enough for me to getting start with the current work and then I have to leave? It does not make sense no matter for the company or myself.

2. Student working with OPT will not occupy the opportunities of the work of U.S citizens. Student with OPT will eventually get back to their own country if they cannot obtain a valid working visa, which is capped as 85,000 per year (and the majority of the visa is actually obtained some foreign consulting companies), so the total foreign workers with valid visa is not going to increase because of the extension of OPT. On the contrary, as most of the OPT applicants are well educated, working in relative innovative and creative field, it only likely to boost the market and economy and create more job opportunities.

3. U.S need more competitive environment to continue leading as the top 1 country in the world. Just to remind you, today's prosperous United States is based on their competitive and innovative parents and grandparents. The source of this spirit, is the fusion of different minds and thoughts, coming from different nations and peoples. It is essential to have these innovative, creative and hard working young people stay for a little longer to contribute, and help to keep a competitive United States.
