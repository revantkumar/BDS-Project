Tency Tong I SUPPORT the proposal for following reasons:

1. More talents, more contributions. OPT provides the opportunities for those highly skilled and educated young talents to make contribution in U.S.. These talented students have succeeded from the massive competitions among the numerous countries before entering the U.S.. They have a higher awareness of what they are doing, and they are well prepared to endure the hardship that they are going to encounter. The government ought to be confident about the ability of the international students by giving them chances to make contribution. Otherwise, things stay the same. Nothing would be changed or improved.

2. Society needs diversity, while technology and science need it as well.
Diverse society gives people a broader look about the world and inspires people to think more objectively toward the problems. People actively ask for truth and justice and freely express their thoughts toward every issue. This is why the U.S. has been so successful. This era needs innovation to progress, and innovation comes from the diverse ideas coming from diverse people. Being too conservative toward international students will directly leads to the loss of these potential contributors while other opening countries can benefit from them both economically and developmentally.
