We need to limit these visa's. Employers come in lay off or fire the American workers to bring in their own people. Look at the merger between the Siemens and Westinghouse. The American workers were laid off and the German workers brough in to take the jobs. This is not FAIR. We do not have enough jobs for Americans. Stop this nonsense now.
