This is a great rule! I have read a lot of comments about unemployment rate and give the few jobs to American first. What I want to say is this rule is about to provide foreign students whose major is in STEM list. And STEM is designed to let foreign students fill up those majors that American do not want to select. I did not see any conflict between providing STEM students with OPT extension and provide the few jobs to American. If two candidates with similar skill strength, a recruiter in most cases will hire American, because less cost (no need to sponsor VISA). Now, foreigners are largely working in IT fields, this is not because foreigners are smarter or more hard-working than Americans, this is because not so many Americans are will to select this major! In the fields that Americans dominates, such as lawyer and doctor, there are few foreign students. Moreover, even if all big techs are not going to hire foreign students, I don't think the Americans who study at law or medical school is be able to fill up these vacancies.
