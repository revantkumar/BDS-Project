Aaron Luan I support the Act. I can fully understand what Americans concern about. However this will long term benefit U.S. economy, hi-tech industry and all other industries as well and hence helping the country wellness. I can hardly imagine if those great companies like google, amazon, apple, microsoft and facebook can keep their advantages to their peers worldwide without the best resource as they are having now.
