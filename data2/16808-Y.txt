The OPT policy enables the foreign bright students to make much contributions to this country for a long time. In my eyes, the foreign students are not only full of intelligence, but also hard-working guys. Also, the STEM students focus on many crucial fields which ensure our country to be the most strong country in the world. That is why our country can lead the world in these decades. 

For many local residents in our country, frankly speaking, plenty of students around me pursue the degrees in the business, medicine and laws. On the contrary, they do not prefer studying the STEM courses because they think that these subjects are hard and boring, which also bring them less salaries in the above three areas. If we can not provide more opportunities for the foreign students and attract them to make contributions to the STEM fields in our country, our country may be lagged behind by some fast-developing countries. With out good policies, how could our country keep strong and prosperous???
