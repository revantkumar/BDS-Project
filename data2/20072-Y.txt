I strongly SUPPORT this proposed OPT program. It just makes no sense forcing well-versed international STEM graduate students out of US after offering financial support and advanced education, and it would be great loss to the US STEM industry. Imagine what will happen to hi-tech companies like google, MS, fb after losing so many talented employees. Actually retaining talented international students will boost the industry and can in return create more job opportunities for the local.
