I strongly support this new policy for the following reasons:

Firstly, this rule will not do any harm to U.S. economy. On the contary, it can attract more talented foreign students major in STEM to fulfill the large amount of requirements in related area. The extension of OPT provides not only opportunity to a student, but also a boost in the nation's economy.

Secondly, I consider American spirit as equality to all talented people and absorbtion of advantages from different culture. A culture prospers because of its admissions to others.
