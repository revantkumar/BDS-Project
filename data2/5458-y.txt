Dennis Xiong I strongly support the new proposal. Well educated international employee can benefit the campaniles a lot! They usually work hard and complain less which make it easier for company to operate. To another aspect, well educated international employee can make the people work harder and higher efficient due to the competitive environment, which will obviously let the industry advance much faster. Besides, diversity will benefit the society a lot with more innovation!
