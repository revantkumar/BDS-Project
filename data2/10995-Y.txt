I strongly support the new OPT-extension rule. After reviewing the against comments online, I found the majority of them unwarranted and even ridiculous.
One comment said Allow most participants to pays NO money into Social Security or Medicare. This is not true. Non-citizens who live in the US for more than five years pay for Social Security and Medicare. This is has nothing to do with whether somebody is in the OPT or not. This means almost ALL the international PHD students pay for these the first day they start their OPT. Another comment said:"Take hundreds of thousands of American jobs and hands them to foreigners". This is wrong as well. Some companies do hire more immigrates than US citizens, but that is ONLY because the US citizens don't do those jobs or are not competent of doing them. Therefore, I think the new rule do nothing hurting the US but to help boost the economic development of the country.
