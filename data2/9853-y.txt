Yunhua Sun In my point of view, allow more foreigners who gets higher education and skills to work in US is a good for the country. They are not illegal immigrants. They are not taking advantage of the social benefits. Instead, they pay taxes, work hard, and might make great changes to the country, just like Einstein. 

First of all, the US is the best country In the world because it's open and fair culture. The US is not the Us any more if it against this culture. 

Secondly, people who has skills and knowledge are great assets to any nations. That's why the US spent a lot of money in education, especially for stem majors. Now, there are many stem major graduates who are ready to put their knowledge into work. Why not using their knowledge to make the country better. 

Third, I agreed unhealthy competition bad. If anyone who is go against the market rules, this is bad for the country. However, it does not make sense if you say you want to keep this job to Americans. No one is taking the job away from any one(except extreme cashews). Once you realize what you can learn from competitors, you will become better and get more opportunities and high salaries. Why should you prevent this competition and opportunities to improve from Americans?
