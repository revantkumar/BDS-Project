Cathy Liu I support to STEM OPT extension. International students came to this country, paid expensive tuition and many of them have good academic performance. It's fair for them to get the chance to work after graduation. This extension can encourage more talented internationals to work in multiplies industries in the US and boom up the local economic significantly. I do believe this regulation can bring benefits to both international students and the county, so I support it.
