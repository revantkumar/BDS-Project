The high-tech industry is one of the few driving forces of American Economy now. Having adequate workforce for that industry is only helpful to the local economy and thus job creation. Canceling OPT extension will largely deprive IT companies of crucial workforce source and make them have to ship jobs overseas or shrink in employment all together.

What's more, international students constitute an important support to the education industry in the US. There will be much fewer international students attending universities in the states if they would know their chance of getting employed afterwards has decreased drastically. That causes loss not only to the universities that largely rely on tuition income from international students but also to the neighborhood of these universities which thrives essentially on the existence of them.

People in different profession cannot compete for the same job. An international student getting trained in the STEM majors and aiming for the high-tech industry wouldn't pose a threat to anyone outside that industry. On the contrary, all his consumption and tax would contribute to public sector and private sector in his neighborhood. The industry is facing extreme lack of qualified workers, not the redundancy. The only viable and reasonable way to help local economy and employment of natives is to help guarantee enough supply of labor force to the high-tech industry before it has to ship the positions overseas, which is not that impossible if political influenced by interest groups keep raising the cost of keeping the jobs in the US.

The only way to help the economy is to embrace the future, not trying to turn back and head to the past. We need an immigration system that guarantees talented and qualified workforce can make their way into the US smoothly.
