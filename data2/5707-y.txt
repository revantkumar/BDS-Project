Ryan Soda I strongly support the proposed rule. MY company, a U.S. high tech firm, is growing pretty fast these years both domestically and internationally. We have been hiring many international students who have received higher degrees in STEM areas of U.S. colleges. They have be contributing a lot to our international business since theyre familiar with cultures and business in their own countries. Were definitely hiring many citizens but found that fewer U.S. students inclined to learn STEM than international students in many colleges. Considering we have tons of international business and large demand for high-talented people, were also hiring international students. As a senior talent acquisition leader in the firm, I believe 24 months or longer of OPT extension will be great for many high tech companies like us. Please pass this proposed rule or many high tech companies will have to face great losses. Thanks!
