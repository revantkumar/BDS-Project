Niranjan Santhanam I strongly Support this new rule as it would give International students who have graduated with a STEM degree to stay longer and gain more expertise in their relevant fields, thereby contributing to the growth of companies here in the US. And also it gives little more time for students to get their H-1B work visa in case the company/Student wants to further work in the US. By retaining highly skilled student/employees the companies can directly contribute to the growth in the economy of the country.
