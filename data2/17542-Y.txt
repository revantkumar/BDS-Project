STEM students are not working on less wages they are earning more than median family income of US family.

US is was and will be the country of immigrants. Just because some came here earlier can't stop coming other people.We aren't illegal immigrants and It is not our purpose to migrate here forever (Because of hardships one has to face to become a US citizen).
