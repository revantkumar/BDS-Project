I am a student in NJ, major in quant finance. My family sold house to support me. I will be DESPERATE if this is cancelled. If there is limited opportunities to work in America, my learning of stochastic process, programming is totally useless at all! Then I shouldn't come to America to pay for the highest fee in the world.
