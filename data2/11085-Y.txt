I am a US Citizen with a Master Degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech in Artificial Intelligence. I am in my mid forties and have a hard time getting newer opportunities to work in the high tech industry as the silicon valley based technology industry prefers to hire fresh grads with far lower skill and experience because it costs them less and they are willing to work for long extra hours. Most of these fresh graduates are on OPT and moving to H1. I have several friends of mine with master degrees in advanced fields who are unable to find work commensurate with their education, qualification and experience just because of programs like OPT and H1 which are letting High Tech companies in SIlicon valley undercut American Engineers in salary and quality of life issues.

This extension of OPT by 24 months would make things even worse for Qualified Workers like myself and would discourage Americans in the future from pursuing STEM courses as they are likely to be undercut in salary and quality of work life by cheaper OPT and H1 labor.

I see the extension of OPT by 24 months as a giveaway to High Tech companies who want average cheaper labor at the cost of well qualified American workers. High Tech companies do not just want Tech Workers, byt they want them cheaper and this is a giveaway for that. As a US citizen I do not support this.
