I do agree and support this OPT extension totally. the foreign students who have OPT should got a offer from company or work for some company already, meaning this company need these employees so much. As we all known, US company never hire a helpless or useless people ever. US development need these guys.
The H1B petition is harder and harder by years because there are so many job opening coming, we need good hands to fill those opening to keep everything smooth and growing. Just imaging: people who working on some important projects or research have to leave due to the expiration of OPT, how much lose for a company?
if government is not able to provide more H1B, the OPT extension can help those smart people stay longer in US to contribute and get more chance for H1B.
