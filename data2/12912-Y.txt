Students from all over the world struggle and study in prestigious universities in USA . They work dawn and dusk to secure jobs in their fields.Many students pay exorbitant money for their education in USA some of them spending all their savings , few selling off their parents property and support their education

These students after completing education work in research and top companies they help in country progress .unlike h1b holderstudents contribution to country progress is very immense

I request to extend opt for 6 years. There must be fair policy between h1b holder and student . off late companies of Indian origin are sending employees of minimal skills who lack basics these employees are able to work for 6 years but a student who has studied in top schools willing to contribute for us development is sent back home.

Please support students and encourage them by extending opt period. Save students save us economy
