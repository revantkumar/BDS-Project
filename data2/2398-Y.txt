President Obama seems not to care about the future of the States and wants amnesty for the illegal immigrants. However, we should. 

Compared to for the illiterate illegal aliens, I prefer amnesty for the top university students from around the world and give them opportunities to thrive and contribute for the benefit of the United States. 

These highly-educated students represent the future of our nation. Please do not turn our back to our nation's future.
