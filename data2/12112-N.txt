I continue to adamantly oppose this program for the following reasons:

It allows most participants to pays NO money into Social Security or Medicare;
It takes hundreds of thousands of American jobs and hands them to foreigners; 
It fails to require employers to pay the prevailing (usual) wage. 

This is against America and the American worker and I want it scrapped immediately.
