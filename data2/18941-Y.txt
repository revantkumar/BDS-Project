This is a great rule for OPT extension.

This gives people opportunity to further enhance their skills in the industry related to the knowledge they obtained from U.S colleges. Getting a degree does not mean much unless that translates to good job opportunities. Experience in well developed industries in the U.S is a essential part of one's career. 

It has little negative impact to local people's jobs. The amount of people with similar degree is only a small portion in the work force. The F-1 visa already excludes many companies to hire F-1 student since many companies do not support sponsorship. The OPT also restricts F-1 students only obtain jobs related to their field of study. The job contention with people from the labor union is minimal.

At the same time, many qualifying workers entering the high end of the job market helps the U.S continue to lead the high-tech industry.
