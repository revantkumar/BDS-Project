Anne Baker I strongly support this proposal. This proposal will attract more international STEM students and therefore boost the local economy.
I am a resident in the Fenway/Kenmore area of Boston, MA, which has a lot of universities and colleges, such as Boston University, Northeastern University, Simmon College, ect. In recent years I noticed more international students joining the neighborhood. As a result, lots of new stores and restaurants opens up, new apartment buildings are in construction, and Fenway/Kenmore area is now more than just a baseball park. I am sure the boosted local economy will benefit local citizens from all aspects, such as more jobs, more income, and more fun places.
Thus I would strongly support this proposal.
