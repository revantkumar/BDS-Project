Daniel Sphar I strongly support the Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Policy:

The unemployment of US is not caused by F-1 students. On the contrary, F-1 students satisfy the the US companies are smart. they will only hire F-1 students if they cannot find suitable Americans for this position, because companies pay same salary but F-1 students need special person to take care of their sponsorship.
