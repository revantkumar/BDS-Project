I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. On one side.

US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.

I don't think they have to worry about it will take away US citizen's job opportunities at all. First, the proposed rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US. And OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if they get caught. Second, it was because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that international student can come in. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. And those tech companies is risking potential loss of those international employees because of the H1B lottery system. So, the employers have no reasons to choose international workers from US citizens if they had that choices.

the brave US people are never afraid of competitions, I think it is that makes USA so great, and it also brings the best people, like the best scientists, the best engineer to USA, that's one of the reasons that USA is the only superpower in this world.
