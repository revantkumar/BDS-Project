Xiao Yang As an international student myself, I strongly support this new policy to extend and improve the training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees. Considering the increasing number of international STEM students who got trained by the US schools, the current 17 months OPT policy or the original 12 month policy was barely enough for the STEM students to obtain a H1B visa after graduation that can help them to legally work in US.

Why is letting the international students work in US that important? The US schools have invested money and resources to attract these talented young people from all over the world. And many of these students are wiling to work in US in order to contribute what they've learned in school back to the society as returning the favor. These young people, with age averaging between 24-28, are approaching their "career peak" with great enthusiasm, creativity and productivity. It would have been such a waste to see them getting rejected by the US industry not because of incompetency or their personal choices, but due to the limited work/training authorization policy. 

I believe this new OPT policy with 24-month extension is going to make more contributions to the US country in the long term.
