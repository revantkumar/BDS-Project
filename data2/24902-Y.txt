My company has an employee working on F1/OPT. She is an excellent software engineer. If she cannot work on her OPT extension, the company will have to find her replacement immediately. And it would be really hard to find a hardworking and reliable employee like her. Since my company is a small startup company, thus would be a terrible setback to the company's growth. 

So thinking of the many small startup companies like the one I'm working with, I would strongly suggest allowing opt extension.
