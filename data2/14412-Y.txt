Dear Sir or Madam, I am an international student studying in STEM fields. Many people have expressed their worries about OPT program harming the employment of US citizens and the potential immigration problem in their comments, which I fully understand. However, there are two things that I would like to point out in this comment. Firstly, the people who are in the OPT program are not just any STEM workers - they are newly graduated students. Secondly, STEM jobs are challenging and it takes more time for newly grad to get familiar with the industry and become productive. At Google people often say to the Nooglers (new Googlers) that they won't be productive in the first 6 months. Provided with the best higher education in the world and given enough time, we international students will be able to contribute to American society at our best. The openness and the ability to attract brilliant minds are what make the U.S. a great nation.
