I fully agree with the proposal for the STEM opt extension for the following reasons:

1)The international students could make more contributions to the U.S. if they could stay longer and apply what they've learned to work. Many international students are pursing a graduate degree and they could form a remarkable workforce in every field of the US development.

2)The international students themselves could help prosper the economy of United States.
If more and more international students are leaving this country because they have no legal way to stay longer for practical training, there will be a tremendous loss for the local housing service, entertainment industry, auto industry and so on. 

3)Even though there are more competitions, they are good ones. American is famous for its equal employment opportunity policy and provides fair chances for job seekers whatever their race, nationality and gender. The competitions brought by the internationals will also better the quality of employees for any enterprise.

This new proposal will certainly bring a great value to the international students and U.S. employers, and further enhance the flourish of United States.
