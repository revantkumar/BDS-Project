F-1 Students With STEM Degrees's Expanding OPT is really needful, for both American companies and students themselves. As all know, Many companies, mostly IT companies do need talents(especially in STEM) as their employees.

If STEM Extension is cancelled finally, I guess more than 50000 employees HAVE TO leave their jobs, which means a big impact on companies's operations. Companies will suffer the loss because qualified employees were kicked out because the cancellation of OPT extension. 

On F1 student's side, they should be given the chance to use their knowledge to do real practical training. Also, America can also take advantage of those excellent people. OPT extension and expanding opportunities are really beneficial for both America and F1 students.
