The STEM extension is very important to my work status. I chose to study statistics because I knew there would be more working time after graduation. I really hope that STEM OPT extension can be kept. I love my current job, and certainly do not want to lose it because of the sudden policy change. I am pleading for the OPT extension for STEM major.
