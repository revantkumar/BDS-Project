By passing this rule, it will attract more talented people coming to US and thus make US better and better.

I hate some citizens providing some non-sense statement like company pays cheaper for opt students and make many of them lose the job. If you are saying this, you obviously never work in a good company. Our company only hires the good ones. We would rater pay higher to hire the talented worker than pay less money for someone not that good.

Come on, we are an immigration country! Don't be selfish because it hurts U.S. a lot!
