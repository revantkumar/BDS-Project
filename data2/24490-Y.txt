First of all, I really appreciate the decision that DHS will expand the OPT policy.

But I am really disappointed by the negative reviews. How come some of the people living in this country being so shortsighted and biased.

If you got the same education as foreigners did, why would you worry about losing job opportunities when a foreigner could even get one? If you are not as competitive as a foreigner, why would you worry about losing job opportunities that would never belong to you? People are talking like the citizenship is some kind of privileges that used to make them employeed automatically several years ago, if that's the case, don't worry, it's irrelevant to the OPT policy, because it won't grant foreigners citizenship.

I also noticed that people are talking about how creative and smart the American students are in many reviews. I totally agree with you and I have to admit that's the truth, but I just want to mention that this specific policy you are leaving a comment or review to, is actually serving for the foreigners that also study in the very American education system, and most of them graduate from one of those so-called top universities by you American people, in case you forgot to skim the policy itself before you furiously leave some comments. Either you got some not very elegant double standard or you lied about the creativity or smartness of American students if you want to deny the fact you were talking about.

And at last, if capitalized words could make you sound more reasoning, please, capitalize all the words. I won't do that, because I don't want to look like a paper tiger.
