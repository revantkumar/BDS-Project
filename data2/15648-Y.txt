I strongly support the proposal because of the following reasons:

1. Government should let individual's capability decide their employment opportunities among competitors, not based on the nationality/gender/race/color, which is the fundamental of EEO. Extending STEM OPT to 36 month in total can make the hiring procee fairer, helping hiring companies making decisions eaiser without considering this candidate might be force to leave the company due to his/her short OPT time.

2. Currently, Corporate America is cutting recruitement of international students with limited OPT time because the H1B lotting process is too competitive and crucial for international students to get their working visa. By exending STEM OPT to 36 month in total can significantly relieve the burden, and help boost the prosperity in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematicas with STEM student's talent.
