I do support STEM extension. Obviously, states benefited a lot from international students and these students are hard-working and full of passion. Not only did they bring power to the industry, they brought tremendous fundings for colleges as well. Besides, this extension will definitely do harm to citizen employment because this does not obey the just rule for seeking jobs.
