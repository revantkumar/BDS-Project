A report from the the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) says that International students play a critical role in sustaining quality science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduate programs at U.S. universities. It will come as no surprise to observers of graduate education that the report documents the fact that foreign students make up the majority of enrollments in U.S. graduate programs in many STEM fields, accounting for 70.3 percent of all full-time graduate students in electrical engineering, 63.2 percent in computer science, 60.4 percent in industrial engineering, and more than 50 percent in chemical, materials and mechanical engineering, as well as in economics (a non-STEM field). However, the report, which analyzes National Science Foundation enrollment data from 2010 by field and institution, also shows that these striking averages mask even higher proportions at many individual universities. 

International students are choosing U.S.A as a destination for earning STEM graduate degrees because of available resources for conducting high quality research in U.S.A universities. These students work with assistant, associate and full time professors to publish high quality research work in prestigious journals. This research work is a basis for technology innovations, start ups, and making U.S.A as a global technology leader in the world. Many of these STEM students do consider (while choosing USA as a destination for earning STEM graduate degrees) of gaining some practical experience after the completion of their graduate degrees before they leave U.S.A. Thus, this new STEM OPT rule will help research going forward by attracting International students to pursue their graduate degrees in U.S.A.
