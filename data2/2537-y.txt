Jinru Xue I think enlong OPT to 24 months do help internatioanl student and benefit US government. Comptition is welcome in every field. And we all know that international student work hard and achieve lots especially those who want to have work in US. This means that there are flow of skillful candidates at job market. This situation can not only improve companies' competitive power, but also can encourage the other employees to improve their skill. It is obvious that most of the international student do help their companies even the whole country get progress. By the way I do not think that most of the international students who want to work in US do also want to immigrate to US. We have to understand that what they learn is under American system, they might want to have some practice at America and then go back to their own countries. These working experimented may give them advantage in their motherland's job market! Government Gould not deny the achievement made by the international students!
