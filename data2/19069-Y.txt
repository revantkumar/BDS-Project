Dear ICEB, 

I support the 24-month STEM OPT extension on the basis of the following reasons. 

First, Shortage of high-talented workers indeed exists. 
In 2013, A letter, written by more than 100 chief executives of major tech companies and trade associations, addressed the shortage and need for highly skilled tech workers to political leaders in US including president Obama.(reference 1) In the letter, it stated "Five high-tech companies alone - IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm- have combined 10,000 openings in the United States.". The enactment of the 24-month OPT extension will allow extended contributions from the STEM students and will certainly fuel the power for innovation, which is a long-lasting driving force for the greatness of United States. 

Second, competition is the driving force for excellence, and too many interferences from government would damage economic freedom.
"The father of modern economics supported a limited role for government."Mark Skousen. Many obstacles have been put on skilled foreigners of finding opportunities. Lots of job positions require US citizenship or permanent residence. Most of the rest companies have preference for hiring US citizens over foreigners. Considering the obstacles and difficulties foreigners encounter in finding opportunities, an apparent question to ask ourselves would be: "why American companies sometimes choose to hire foreigners?" I would like to believe that American companies are clever enough to hire the most competitive people. With all due respect, American people should be more open and confident as a super power, that they can compete with the foreigners with a huge advantage of citizenship. On the contrary, too much "guidance" from government damages the equal competition in the job market, sabotaging the economic freedom.
