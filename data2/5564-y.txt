Praveen Kumar Chikkamma Prabhakar The number of H1B applications is increasing every year and causing the application process to go into selection by lottery. This is very unfair way of granting H1B visa's to students who have invested a lot of money and time in getting a degree in STEM fields from US universities. 12 months of OPT followed by a 24 month extension will give a minimum of 3 attempts to obtain a H1B visa. Since there is no reform to increase the H1B cap , this reform is essential in providing students that extra attempt at obtaining a H1B visa. I support this reform.
