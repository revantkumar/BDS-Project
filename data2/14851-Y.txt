I highly support this proposed rule. The economy of the US highly depends on high-tech companies which hire a lot of non-immigrant talents each year. Those people contribute much to the economic growth by hard working day and night. Many of IT work positions require laborious work with much lower pay (compared to many Financial companies) in return. Only those nonimmigrant new graduates are willing to take such positions, with the hope that they can stay in the US in the future. If OPT extension is cancelled, few international students will select to pursue STEM degrees in US. This will result in direct economic loss considering the fact that many schools and universities recruit a lot of international students who pay much higher tuition fees than local students. Moreover, it will become very hard for those high-tech companies to high many well-educated labors. It will cause great damage to the economy in the long run. Considering the national interests and long-term development, it is a wise and well-informed decision to support the proposed rule.
