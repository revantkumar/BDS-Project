STEM graduates are beneficial to the U.S. economy. With signs of slowing down in the global economy, keeping STEM graduates in the U.S. is a great way to maintain America's competitivity. Without the OPT extension, many talented engineers, scientists, and mathematicians will choose to work in a different country, and resources spent on their education will be gone with them. 
Most STEM students are willing to stay and be productive in the U.S.. They are definitely a positive contribution to the society. If it were up to me, we should be beating whether we should offer STEM graduates green cards, rather than extensions of OPT. 
Expanding the OPT program is a win-win situation. 
We should definitely make the extension official.
