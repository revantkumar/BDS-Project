Yike Xue The rule does more GOOD than harm to Americans as well as the international students!!!

I can never image our company and most other IT enterprises could run without the majority OPTers. Without the rule, many of the mid-size IT companies would get into troubles.

On the other hand, this rule is the main reason that keeps attracting talented foreign students to come to the US. Many of them contributed a lot after graduation in every area of American industry--aeronautics, physics, information technology, etc. The quality of many universities is improving year by year. American students benefit from it also. They will have excellent classmates and better study environment.

The only "bad" thing about it is some people may not be able to lay back and wait for a job.
