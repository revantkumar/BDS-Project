Kshitij Pandya I strongly support the OPT stem extension expansion for it may provide better training opportunities for international students after completing their respective degrees. This could help students improve their profile many folds with specializations in fields they desire to work in. And this program would also help students gain stronghold with the technology stack that is desired by the market these days and create a broad spectrum on their resume which would span many areas be it any STEM related field only to help the betterment of the industry.
