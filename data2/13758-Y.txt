I support the new OPT extension rule.
First, I think it is a good method for America to attract talent person. I am an international student from China, and I major in engineering management program. The reason I choose to study in the US is because it can provide more opportunities and better resources than other countries. If the OPT has longer time, I will have enough time to apply my skill in my intern or job. It can help to increase American productivity. And if the OPT has longer time, it will attract more person who want to show their talent and catch the opportunities. So that talent people will attribute to American economics and development.
Second, there are many programs which need more than 2 years. If the OPT time is too short, some international employees cannot get visa in time then the program may be influenced or delayed.
Finally, I am a Chinese STEM student, and I would like to return to China after I have several working experiences in the US so that I can become more competitive than others in China. Therefore, I think the new OPT extension rule is beneficial for American industry and development and international STEM students.

Hope more people can support this new rule!
