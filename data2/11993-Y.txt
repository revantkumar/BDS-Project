I strongly support this new rule, as practical training will boost US economy. I personally use my OPT in Research Labs, and would like to use OPT extension to have some training at Industry. I don't understand why some people treat international students as potential immigrants. I admit we are competitive, at least I am proud that I have cutting-edge research work done, regardless of how much payment I get. Please, those anti-"international students" people, grow up and get a life.
