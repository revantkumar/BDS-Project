STEM OPT extension is very beneficial and necessary for international students in getting a hands-on experience on the new technologies available in current market. US is known for development and innovation, and a number of international students come here hoping to contribute their fair share. 

OPT extension gives talented and skilled immigrants a chance to work in the US. I have seen many vacancies,during my job search, that are reserved only for US Citizens and Permanent Residents and I do not think, in any way, this extension rule would neither decrease their chances nor create an imbalance. As stated in many research surveys, international students contribute major share in the research/development in this country.

I request DHS to consider extending the OPT by 24 months, which is not only helpful for STEM students, but also for US universities and companies. Create an Immigrant friendly culture in the US and care for the students who come here a long way from home.
