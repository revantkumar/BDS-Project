To Whom It May Concern- I think that any person that tries to be shady and go behind the backs of the people that they are supposed to represent is a very sorry person and so are the people that go along to get along !If you people want these programs so bad ,I think you should stick your hand in your own pockets and waste your money. You people are being paid to keep the American people safe instead of worrying about people that are not even supposed to be in this country ! I think keeping Americans safe should Occupy all the time that you are getting paid for. Now we are told that your Department of Homeland Security can't even keep up with people you have trained .If you remember the last time that happened ,we were hit with a terrorist attack on 9/11 .Thank you for your time.
