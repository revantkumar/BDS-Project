Jue Wu Compared with initial OPT extension rule from 2008, the new rule definitely considers more about American workers. It extends total potential OPT up to 36 months, however, it also puts on more requirements and restrictions for OPT students.

First, if a STEM student wants to apply for OPT extension, his employer will be required to implement format Mentoring and Training Program. In other words, OPT students need to provide more detailed evidence to support their jobs are related to their majors. This narrows down OPT students job markets, more positions will be left for Americans.

Second, as part of the Mentoring and Training Program, employers who hire OPT students must provide more documents support that: (1) the employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the students opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives. Therefore, it reduces situations that citizens may be laid off because OPT students cheap salaries. 

All in all, the new proposal is a win-win to both STEM students and American citizens, because it provides longer periods for OPT students working legally in the US, however, at the same time, it narrows their job options and adds more restrictions, which is a protection for citizen workers.
