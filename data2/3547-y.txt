Julie H. OPT program creates more value than its potential cost, therefore its extension should be approved as a rule. Some value can be measured, such as economic growth, new jobs created, etc. STEM students have relatively more "empowering" skills to drive those measurable growth. Foreign STEM students also help the growth of US business in foreign markets. Lots people complain the cost of the program, yet they overlooked that it provides far more than its cost. 

There are also values that can not be measured. Foreign students not only bring their skills with them, they also bring their culture, their unique and diverse experience that most of us do not possess, with them. President Obama once said, "diversity is what made us rich". It's also what made us stay ahead of competition with other parts of the planet. OPT and its extension attracts foreign students and give them time to make their contribution to this country.

Lots people are concerned that US citizen would lose their job or would not be able to get employed, because foreign students raise competition or that foreign students are cheaper. First of all, competition is never a bad thing. In fact, we need competition to ensure that Americans stay ahead of their peers in this global economy. As for the wages, DHS is take steps to ensure that US workers are not harmed because of this rule (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/19/2015-26395/improving-and-expanding-training-opportunities-for-f-1-nonimmigrant-students-with-stem-degrees-and#p-228). 

I vote for the approval of this rule.
