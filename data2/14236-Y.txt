I strongly support "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students".
All the people in the world know why America must and can be the Number 1, because America has the most advanced IT and smart scientists in STEM areas, if all of them leave America to other developing countries, I think that's gonna not good for everyone in America.
Because we all live in this IT era, nobody want to lost the most important human resource except you choose to give up the future of your country and next generations!
