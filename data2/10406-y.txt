Amanda Ellis I am speaking based on my experiences as a recent Biomedical graduate. As we all known, there are not enough Americans in graduate of post-graduate education. In my department, half of the PhD students are foreigners. The foreign students are fulfilling the need for the employers needed. The OPT is 12 months now, it is not enough for them even get familiar their job.OPT holders are not cheap labors. They are qualified and hardworking people who is able to contribute to this society. They got job related to their degree and got professional knowledge which is useful to all of us. I believe OPT extension will not take jobs from qualified Americans. 
PLEASE allow the rule to take effect and let those people contribute our society.
