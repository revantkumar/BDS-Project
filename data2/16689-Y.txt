I disagree with WashTech's argument that American citizens are displaced by F1 student employment. It should be understood that at present, it is an uphill battle for international students to secure employment on OPT due to the "temporary" nature of their visa. Employers are hesitant, and that is understandable. The OPT expansion proposal would open many doors for them to garner the required training because employers would see this as an adequate time frame to contemplate the H1B visa! F1's are not stealing jobs. The entire nature of their stay is temporary.
