Logan Marple I strongly support the OPT extension for international STEM students, which is surely a win-win policy for US citizens and international students for the following reasons:

First, lots of reports and studies concluded that immigrant scientist and engineers making huge contributions to USA. Highly skilled immigrant scientist and engineers are important source for technology innovation and important factor to keep US economy growth. If you dont give international STEM students a reasonable time to get a H1B visa via lottery, they will have no choice but go back to make contribution to their own countries, which will harm US interest and benefit the competitors.

Second, international STEM student are not stealing on job opportunities from US citizens. It is well known that US are short on STEM workers. Without highly skilled international STEM students, these tech companies will face a shortage in hiring tech workers, eventually, they will have no choice but go seeking for skilled workers overseas and move part of their business there. Meanwhile, immigrant STEM workers are actually creating new jobs for USA. The job market isn't a Zero-Sum Game. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). 

Third, each immigrant workers in STEM fields pay considerable amount of tax to the federal and the state, generally more than 30% of their salary. These tax will eventually be used in increasing the welfare and improve the education of American people.
