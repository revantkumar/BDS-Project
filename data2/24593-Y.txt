This rule is definitely essential and far-reaching in the sense that it enables the U.S. benefit much more from the productivity of STEM students educated by its own academic resources. As a large percentage of these students were funded, it would be a huge waste if the U.S don't give them a stable & worrying-free chance to serve the STEM industry whose development makes a huge difference in terms of the well-being of the whole society, i.g. creating more jobs for citizens. So I think this rule will definitely benefit the economics of the States especially amid the expected global turmoil.
