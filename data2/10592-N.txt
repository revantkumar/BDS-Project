I say no to Obamas' intend to allow Non-Immigrant students to over stay the current amount of time (12 months} in-which 
they are allowed to work while pursuing a degree via "OPT" programs. 

Why should they be allowed to seek work in the United States when many, many American workers are still unemployed. It is
unfair to all American Workers. Why not train Americans instead allowing foreign students to study and work in this country for
free.

I have already seen an American get fired from a job for calling a non-immigrant Mexican student a "Gringo" in a joking
manner. 

Obama has caused all of the immigration problems via Mexico, India, and the Middle East. It is unfair for Amercians to be
second-rate to foreigners.
