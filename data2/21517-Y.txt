The 24-month OPT extension will definitely help international high technology students with high degrees to serve in the big companies using their talents. The extension will provide an extra opportunity for high technology students who failed their H1B application for the first year. It is very common to fail the H1B application for the first year--for me, I'm a Ph.D student in Civil Engineering, only 2 of 6 of my Ph.D friends had successfully get the H1B visa in April, 2015. Some of my Ph.D friends were forced to go back to their own country since their F-1 Visa has been expired and didn't get the H1B, which were frustrated for them. Most importantly, however, their companies were suddenly suffering a big talent loss since the companies have already trained them for nearly two years. And their companies had to take another 2-year training to get an equal-talent employee.

For me, I am currently employed in the No. 1 Engineering Design FIrm of the world (a Fortune 200 company), and I have already been trained one year so far. I'm currently a qualified Geotechnical Engineer in my company and have already designed millions of dollars projects for our clients, including highway transportation, soil slope stability, dams, deep foundations, power plants, etc. Some of them are related with Federal projects. If the OPT extension is invalid in next February, I will be forced to go back to China with my wife and may never come back again, since I can easily find a high technology job in China based on my education and my world-class work experience. It would be definitely a big talent loss to my company, as well as to the United States.
