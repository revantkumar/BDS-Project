I strongly support the policy. By implementing the rule not only the non-immigrant students with STEM degree can contribute to the economy of the country but also would also ample amount of time to grow individually by understanding the different dynamics of the industry. By retaining the STEM degree students the talent pool of US can only increase and lead towards the growth of the nation.
