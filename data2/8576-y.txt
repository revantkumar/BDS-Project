Feitian Zhang I highly agree with the step that Homeland Security Department is taking to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees. 

I am working at University of Maryland using my OPT-extension on an ONR (Office of Naval Research)-funded project --- PECASE (Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers). I am the leading research person in this project, advising several undergraduate and graduate UMD students.

Without the new policy regarding OPT-extension implemented, I will be force to leave the country since the 17-month OPT-extension will not be valid either. That would be a great loss to the PECASE project, the research lab in Aerospace Engineering at UMD, and the students that I am advising. I believe thousands of people like me will have to leave their positions if the OPT-extension policy doesn't get accepted. That would be very unfortunately for us to be force to stop our on-going research, but more importantly, that would be a tragedy in the US University system.
