This is an cheering proposal!!!! I definitely vote for this!!!America will fall by shutting the door to high level STEM students! We may gain some jobs by keeping the STEM students out. But, we will lose much more by letting go these talents, who will contribute to this country at a higher level by innovation and advancement in science and technology, which in turn creates new jobs and opportunities! Being open and attracting the talents to come the US and to contribute has long being the driving force for the prospering of the American society. We should not let the short-sight of some people to ruin our society's openness, innovation and prosperity as a whole!!!
