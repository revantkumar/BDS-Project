The Department of Homeland Security is proposing the expansion of the OPT program for foreign students. At the least this is helpful and important for American workers because of the following:

OPT actually creates American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT provides $4 billion for the Social Security and Medicare trust funds from international students who use OPT Extension.

This expansion must take place.
