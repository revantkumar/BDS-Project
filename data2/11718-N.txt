I have been really struggling with the reasons our government wants to bring foreigners into this nation when our own legal immigrants and citizens are being forced out of these jobs....every job available is being offered to foreigners, and companies like Disney are forced to train their foreign replacements. The zuckerbergs of the country, who should be putting people to work, are trying to get visas for foreign help, I guess to save money. Meanwhile, kids cannot get hired to pay off their college loans, and people who have worked for years are forced to train their foreign replacement. It stinks to high heaven. 

Get this country back to work Mr. President. Close the doors to the visas until people are working again. Your duty is to your country, not the world. Welcome foreigners when this country is prosperous, and people are working again. Until then, NO,NO, NO, NO, NO!!!!
