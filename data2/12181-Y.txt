I strongly support this new rule. Now the science and technology are critical foundation for all countries. The U.S. government needs to keep those STEM students who already educated in the U.S. as they are able to contribute their knowledge to boost the development of science and technology. If the U.S. still try to keep advanced science and technology, do not sent STEM students who educated in the U.S. back to their countries!
