Please do not approve or begin this program. Myself and hundreds of thousands of unemployed IT, science workers, engineering, students cannot find work or are having immense competition from foreign workers and students. DHS and the Federal government are supposed to represent the American worker and citizens first, before assisting anybody else. I cannot get suitable work due to foreign legal and illegal IT workers. They work for less, without benefits. Global Hi-Tech corporations disregard the American workers, disrespect us, and hire non-citizens constantly. We are taking a beating. STOP these unfair programs that give our tax money to non- citizen students and workers. STOP! You are now known as the Department of Homeland INSECURITY. You do not provide real security for U. S. Citizens and it's workers. Give our tax money to assist American college students who have a very high unemployment rate due to foreign students taking their jobs. My two nephews who are both recent college grads cannot find work in their field. I cannot find work in my IT field. You don't enforce border security, you don't deport H1-B's, EAD's, who over stay. You don't deport foreign exchange students to over stay, or quit school. You don't do nothing but assist foreign students, workers, and criminals. We're in a very tough economy and DHS is making it worse. Thanks for nothing. Foreign IT recruiters(many with fake names), also control IT contracting and consulting opportunities and they decide who to submit to a hiring manager. We have now allowed non-citizens to control IT employment within U.S. . They call U.S. IT workers from overseas via VoIP phones. This is a national security problem. What is wrong with you, DoL, DHS????
