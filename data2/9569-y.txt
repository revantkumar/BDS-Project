Jicheng Li I support this rule. 

This rule will enhance American economic, scientific and technological competitiveness by attracting talented international students to become involved in expanded post-graduate opportunities in the United States. 

Many countries are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students.For example, Canada also recognizes that educational institutions need international students to compete in the "global race for research talent." Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program up to a maximum of three years. This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of international students in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. 

The cancellation of OPT STEM may push the educated talented students to these countries, making a contribution to their economy. This will be a great loss to USA.
