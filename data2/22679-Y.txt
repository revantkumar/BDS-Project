Expanding OPT extension is a really good policy. Not only for all international students, but also helps all tech companies. For most international students, the most advantage for them to come to US rather than UK, Canada, is because US have the longer OPT to give them enough time to find a job. 
For US government, this is also a good thing, because most STEM students have good technical skill, which will also help US to improve the level of technique and science.
