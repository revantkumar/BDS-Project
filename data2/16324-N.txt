this program is a insult to all the American citizen- students that are seeking a future of potential not the over burning of student loans with under paying corporations that extort the intent of this program. We the people, who have watch as our nation has been eroded by this and other Federal government programs which is one of the primary elements of low pay and underpaying positions that exists today. This program needs to be intended to help exposure of the American Capitalism model not be the federal nipple to be extorted. Do completely away with this or reconfigure, restructure it so that it is not a mechanism or tool for large entities to leverage.
