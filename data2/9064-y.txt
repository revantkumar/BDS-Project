Nishant Boddupalli My OPT is about to expire in May 2016. I have to apply for my H1B visa and if the lottery doesn't pick my name, I will have to leave the country. My company will not be able to replace me because I work with connecting my company with business contacts from around the world. If the OPT for STEM graduates is not extended. My company will not be able to use my resources. This will reduce their ability to serve the industry.
