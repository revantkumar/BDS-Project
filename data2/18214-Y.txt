To Whom It May Concern,

I strongly support this proposal. The OPT expansion has extremely positive effect to U.S. economy with almost no drawbacks. In the oppose, U.S. will go through a hard time if all the STEM in expansion leave the country.

International students are able to stay in America ONLY IF they are employed. With the requirement of E-verification for the expansion, people can make sure that all the students stay in America because THE COUNTRY NEEDS THEM. Also, because local American students get jobs much easier than equivalent international students, the expansion does not really impact the local students much. The reason of the expansion existence is that, America is truly in high demand of excellent employees with STEM Degree.

Recent year U.S. economy recovered and rose. Information Technology made significant contribution to it. If OPT expansion is canceled, most of the IT companies including Google, Facebook, Amazon, will suffer from lacking of qualified employees. It will certainly cause a huge loss of those companies, and then affect their products, stock market and eventually people's daily life of entire country.

The decision is important for all of us. Please carefully consider the proposal. Thank you.
