Dear Sirs,

Your idea of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 Students is detrimental to the citizens of the United States of America. You are cheating the American people by stealing our jobs and giving them to foreigners. DO NOT DO THIS! You must support the rights of Americans, not the US Corporate Establishment that only cares about its profit.

We, the American people, can and will do these jobs at a fair rate for the labor. Do not give our middle class away. 

Here is what has happened over the years:
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

What you must already know is: 
The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.
OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

Do NOT cheat the American worker any more than you have. It is Un-American and Anti-American to give our jobs away!!!

Sincerely, Dayton
