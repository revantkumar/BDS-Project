I Strongly support the proposal. A few of my reasons are listed below:
1: U.S. non-immigrant students are employed by a large variety of employers every year, indicating that they are capable of bringing benefit to U.S. companies and the society, as they are needed in these companies, they should be given the chance to work longer and bring more profits to the U.S.

2. The STEM extension stimulates and encourages more students to come abroad and learn in the U.S, thus bring diversity and workforce.

3. Engineers and scientists are engines of the society, they are the driving force to development, STEM students help improving the U.S. society development.

These are my comments, I hope the U.S. government can seriously consider this proposal.
