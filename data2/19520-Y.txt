What makes the United States a great country is the remarkably open culture that allows the best of the best to contribute to its society no matter where they come from. STEM students, after receiving high-standard education from the United States, are undoubtedly among the best contributors any country would dream of. This 24-month OPT extension policy will not only give the United States an opportunity to benefit from temporary workers who received the world's best education, but also will give these STEM students a chance to examine what they learned and to get a closer look at the working culture of the United States. IT IS A WIN-WIN.

Some citizens may worry that these "foreigners" could replace them on the job market, leaving them unemployed. THIS IS WRONG. Find a history textbook and look at the recessions when hundreds of thousands of job losses were seen. They are not due to foreigners taking jobs of citizens. They are due to lack of economic growth. Having talented people work in this country for two more years - if not more - can only help economy grow, not the other way around.
