Let them get their degree and show them the hell out of here. Americans need the jobs and we can't afford these people in any way, shape, or form. The fact is we never should have let them in, in the first place as they usually cheat on their visa's anyway. I don't even like what I* said to begin with. Giving them a degree is far to much and I'll stick with never letting them in, in the first place. OK Mr. Dictator Obama.We have a country of laws that have been constantly ignored under this administration and there should be a regulation about that. Oppss.., there is. It's called a law and they must be imposed and used and not put on the shelf due to an illegal and unConstitutional Executive Oreder.
