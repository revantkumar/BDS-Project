My son is a 27 year old American who cannot find meaningful work (By that, I mean work that does not involve a drive-thru window). Why are we supporting immigrants who will not pay into social security or Medicaid? Close the Immigrantion window until there is a REAL shortage of workers in the U.S. United States citizens should ALWAYS be the main concern of our legislators. In my opinion, 80% of our legislators are TRAITORS to the American public and should be stripped of their citizenship and forced to leave the country never to return.
