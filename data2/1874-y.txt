Balwanth Bobilli I strongly support the rule for making, 24 months OPT extension. Firstly, this is economically significant to the US Government, and moreover, giving an opportunity to diligent and intelligent students to work 3 years(overall) in USA. Students will gain practical experience and help the companies to boost their profits which ultimately benefits the US government economically and maintaining USA has (Land Of Opportunity) from decades. A positive verdict on this will give definite success to US graduated students and the Country.
