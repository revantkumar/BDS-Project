I am a engineer at a technology company. We do have a lot of international students working here. I have to say they are doing a great job and they do contribute a lot to our company. As far as I know, the silicon valley has lot of international students. This is a great policy to help the American tech companies to keep their status internationally because each company needs a lot of engineers every year. If we loose many great engineers from international student. It will be a big loss damage to US. So I strongly support this new policy.
