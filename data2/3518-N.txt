I oppose the Proposed OPT Expansion!!

What about the Americans with STEM degrees that are not working? There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree. There are about 10 million employed Americans with STEM degrees that are not working in their specialties. I'm appalled that so many visas are given out when SO many these American workers would return to those fields with appropriate incentives.

Foreign workers displace graduating Americans who are struggling to repay massive student loans.

Stop doing an end run around Congressional limits on H-1b 3-year work visas! By turning the F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas, that's what is essentially happening. That is unconscionable given the amount of qualified American workers that are available.

According to knowledgeable sources, there are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas, yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields.
Big Tech lobbyists have spent over $1 billion seeking immigration increases, but Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are laying off tens of thousands of employees. 

I oppose the expansion and it's unconscionable that this is even being considered. Consider the American worker.
