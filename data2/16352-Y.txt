I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. American spirit is to give equal chances to every hard working people, Talented students who come to US to study deserve more time to gain work experience in US.
2. Longer OPT will attract more talented students to come to US which will benefit both economy and education. These income will help college focusing on increasing quality of teaching. Also, more international students will activate the local economy, i e,: An Asia town was built near my school 5 years ago and created hundred jobs.
3.Engineering is the blood of a country, Unite States attracted millions talented engineering students all around the world using OPT and OPT EXTENSION.
