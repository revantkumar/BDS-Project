I don't think it's clever to stop nonimmigrant students' right to work in US institutions after their graduation. US, as the most developed country in the world, should best know the importance of talent. Limiting students' chances of getting jobs in US could only harm the further improvement of this country.

First, the nonimmigrant students will not take up the jobs that belong to American people. As they graduated from rigorous education in the college, they are expected to work in industries that require very profound skills and knowledge. They will not simply take a simple job in corporations. Also, they are chosen by the company because they are unique and cannot be easily replaced. they must have some talents the corporation wants. Otherwise, the company will not choose them.

Second, letting them work in US provide more benefits for the society. All students are under very good education,making them polite. Also, some of them may work in positions that need their understanding of their homecountrsies. As the propel of the globalization, their expertise understanding will only help the US create more profits and make the US more competitive. If the US chase them back to their own countries, it's competitiveness will be weakened.

Finally, some US citizens are unemployed not because of the nonimmigrant students. If you look at the career fair, there are always some vacancies. It may because of their unwillingness for certain jobs. Therefore, with restrictions to only work in certain industries has already insured that US citizens have more prior chances of jobs. The industries need talent people because they need to be competitive.

Due to their expertise and benefits to this country, they should be allowed to work in the US. If they help the country gain more profits, all the US residents get benefited. Through the channel of tax payment, the profits and benefits they've created will help build up a brighter future.
