I am protesting the quadrupling of the "Optional Practical Training" program. 

This new Obama regulation will put hundreds of thousands of more AMERICAN WORKERS out of work! These foreign workers will be exempt from paying payroll taxes enabling their employers to save money that support Social Security and Medicare. Employers are not required to pay standard wages to these foreign workers.

This program is a scam since no "training" occurs. These are simply foreign workers that will take jobs from my college graduate children! The OPT jobs give away program is so bad that even the AFL-CIO is against it.

Shame on Disney, QUALCOMM, and Microsoft for lobbying for this OPT program and planning to lay off tens of thousands of AMERICAN WORKERS and replacing them with foreign workers. Shame on the Obama administration!

Americans are AGAINST the OPT program.
