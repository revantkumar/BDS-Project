Pan Ye I am strongly agree with this proposal considering following facts which brings benefits to USA society:
1. Expanding OPT will reduce the loss rate of technology elites every year, so that those elites will not go back and become strong competitors in the globalized market.

2. Multicultural working environment keeps local environment young and comparatively new with challenges and opportunities. Ideas from different cultures usually give different views of same question/problem, so that the solution could be more effective.

3. Positive competition improves the ability of both employees and employers. A country just keep silent and stable without enough internal competition will definitely loss its global power. 

4. New careers and positions are created by having OPT students, especially for those who makes start ups. A expanded OPT will give more chance to those F-1 students after they get experience in career and market, then start their own business in USA, which definitely will hire more local people.
