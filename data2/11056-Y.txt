I support improving and expanding OPT for STEM degrees F-1 students! Longer OPT period will attract more foreign students to come US rather than choose other countries, like UK or Canada. It will not only stimulate United States economy but also attract more talents around the world. 
On the other hand, when more F-1 students can stay and work in United States longer, it will also boost tourism, shopping income. Students'parents and relatives are more or less to visit US and spend money during this time.
