hahaha ,some comments are really funny:
Let's keep these jobs for hard working Americans, not foreigners!!!
Companies would like to hire person who can make money for them. They are not charity. If you have the abilities to make money for them, they will hire you. Hard working is one of the abilities. However, if you can not get a job, that's because other people are competitive.
Do you own business boy.
