Comment:
The move by DHS to extend the 17 month opt extension to 24 months is really a positive sign for international students. The move not only strengthens the trust international students have on the us education system but also the diplomatic ties between USA and rest of the world mainly India and China which constitute majority of the international students in USA. If possible DHS should also consider extending the opt extension period to 36 months.
