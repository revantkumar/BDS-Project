I DO SUPPORT the OPT-Extension. I'm an chemist in Chicago with the H1B visa and my wife is a STEM student. She planned to find a job in Chicago after graduation. However, if the OPT- Extension is cancelled, she will go back to China and I have to go with her. I'm involved in an important program of my company and I know that it will affect the progress of the program if I go back to my homeland. But I have to go with my wife because I think family is most important. I think I'm not the only person who has this problem.Because of the cancellation of OPT-extension, US will not only lose the talents with STEM degrees, but also lose the H1B visa holders who contribute to the development of US society and economy.
