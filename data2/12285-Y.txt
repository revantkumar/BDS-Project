The country should think about how to remain competitive in this highly innovative world. You CANNOT just lock yourselves into the boarder of USA and continue to have good quality of life as we are enjoying right now. Immigration in and out of the country will happen anyway. It is an indicator whether the country is strong or weak. It is a matter of choice which kind of immigrant we want to welcome. If skilled and innovative immigrants do not prefer USA over other countries in the world, that means we have a problem in our own development. The apparent choice is to welcome more innovative brains to this country. Extending the OPT period for STEM graduates is apparent a wise choice.
