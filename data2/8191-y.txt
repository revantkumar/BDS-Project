Fuzhi Zhao I support the extension of OPT for STEM students. OPT is an important part of education for international students. It is an extension of study after college. The extension of OPT allows students having more time to gain important career skills and prepare them for future success. Usually, projects and researches undertaken by STEM students take a longer period of time to achieve outcomes. The extension of OPT plays a crucial role in benefiting both the companies and students. 

Competition is always existing everywhere. Even if the extension does not exist, the STEM students are still graduating from colleges and universities every year. Even if there is no OPT at all, companies will not lower the requirements for each job vacancies. Even if companies could lower the job requirements, the competition among companies in the U.S and oversea will not decrease. F-1 students have already been restricted from a lot of companies which hire citizens only. The unemployed ratio fell to 5.0% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The full-time employment is now above where it was before the recession. Therefore, the benefits of cancelling the OPT extension to those long-term unemployed are limited. 

The above is the reason why I support OPT extension.
