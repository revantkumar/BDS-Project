The proposal is not only beneficial to the F-1 students, but also have good impact to the US society, and is good for economy. I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Students in STEM learned a lot of practical experience during studying in the U.S. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. 

2. Competition is a good thing, which enables the companies to select better candidates. In IT industry, especially in companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Linkedin, etc. there are many international candidates from China, India who have made great contributions to the IT industry in the U.S. If the proposal is denied, it will be a great loss of the whole IT industry.

Based on these considerations, I strongly support the proposal, which would make a better America.
