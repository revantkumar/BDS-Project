I appreciate the effort in recognising the importance of foreign workers in the STEM fields. Universities accept the best of students without discrimination based on region. This results in a large pool of foreign talent which goes unused if they're not given work permits to help build the national economy. While I definitely support the 24-month extension, I believe it should be extended to 36 months giving a chance for students to contribute longer in the US before returning home.
