I think that the new regulation that extends the period that foreign students can remain in the US an hold a job for up to 36 months is not fair and hinders the ability of young Americans coming out of college to get those jobs. The incentives that are given to the companies which hire those foreign students should not exist because who is going to hire Americans if they get incentives to hire foreigners. I think this has to stop. It is enough that those foreign students get financial help to get their education, while their families pay no taxes in the US. In the same time, students from the US, whose parents are taxpayers, don' get the oportunity to work because companies get incentives to hire foreign students whose families are not taxpayers in the US. Our government is bitting the hand that feeds them.
