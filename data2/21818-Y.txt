The chance should be equal to everyone. It not matters weather you are a native or not. The most important thing should be that weather you are good enough to get the job. I love American, not only because it is a developed country, I mean there are quite a lot of other developed country all over the world. The difference is that American give strong image that everyone is equal. If you are good enough, you can achieve your "American Dream". This nation is consisted by people all over the world. This country is open to every excellent people. What we do is not occupy the resource,but make this country better.
