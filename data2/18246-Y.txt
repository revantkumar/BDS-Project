Great news!! I strongly support these proposal by the DHS . The expansion of opt to 24 months will have a great support for international students to get trained in there STEM fields. The extension not only benefits the international students , but also to the large number of companies and the US economy. Since each STEM worker is capable of creating or providing another 1-2 jobs. I think these rule does not effect the US workers 
I strongly support the proposal
