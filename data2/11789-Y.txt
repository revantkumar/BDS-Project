I support this proposal!!
I am a small business owner and I have a grocery store and a restaurent near the University of Southern California campus. 
99% of my customers are international students and my life gets better because of them. I am actually thinking about expanding my business and hiring more people. Thanks to those students, thousands of people like me can make a living since USC area is already a international student village. Please pass this rule!!!!!
