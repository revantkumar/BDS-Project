I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. More international students in the work place would enhance the national competitiveness which has immeasurable importance to the national or even the worldwide economy in the future.
2.It is important to encourage more international students come and study in the US. The International students can make huge contribution to the local economy.
3. The government should let the students who studied in the US university stay and make contributions to the US.
