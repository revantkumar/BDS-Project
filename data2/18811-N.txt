Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:/revised re
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

I have deep concerns that OPT will continue to remove billions from Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The systems are broke and can't support retired Americans and the government continues to take "OUR" money away from the funds. The SS fund is money I earned and input for my retirement NOT to be taken out and given to others who have not worked and put into the fund.

How much will be removed from SS and Medicare due to this new/revised regulation? What regulation gives permission for funding to come out of SS and Medicare to support this regulation?
