Just think about who will benefit from the extended OPT regulation: The American People! It's simply naive to assume that OPT extension will harm the job opportunities of American workers - the fact would be completely the opposite. The incoming of high tech workers will definitely boost American's economy, especially high tech industry, and it's exactly why US is still No. 1 in the world. A booming high tech industry can create a numerous number of new job opportunities. Being open to high quality immigrants guarantees that US has the highest competition in the world, and being closed to the other part of the world can only make US inevitably fall. To those people who say NO - think twice about the future, the future of high tech industry of US, and your future.
