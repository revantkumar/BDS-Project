The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a 
detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire 
foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of 
available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put 
further downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire 
foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy 
should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it. This move would be a travesty of the "progressive" 
government, which regularly claims to be "looking out for the middle class" while in fact doing things like this which will help to 
destroy it!
