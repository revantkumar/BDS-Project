Of course I SUPPORT to expand STEM OPT time. This policy is very important because it will show a better future to local Americans and international students. Based on the development of internet, every country will connect with each other tightly. Especially for STEM majors, it is a perfect chance to know there is a better market or better company or better product in another place. And we will see that this communication provides another insight to think about work and products. Our progress should be create new market and new products, not just prohibit other competitors. America is the place to give people this chance to achieve their dream. More international students mean a lively market in America, and it is also a good chance to understand other countries. More importantly, local people can contact more people to expand their way to live. Without question, it is a good thing for both of local American and international people.
