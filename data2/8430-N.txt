I am writing to request that the proposed changes to this regulation be eliminated. We need to use our American workers instead of importing foreign workers to take the available jobs. We have far too many legal and illegal workers in this country now. If a foreigner chooses to get an education in this country, that is fine (if they pay for it). However, that should not be a doorway to staying here when the education is completed.
