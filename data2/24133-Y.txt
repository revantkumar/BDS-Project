As a member of a normal household living in the USC neighborhood, this regulation has limited effects on me and my family actually, but I guess it might affect a lot on the number of future international students coming to USC. That is sort of my business then. 

The two houses on the left of mine have been rented to the USC students for years, especially after 2009, the booming of international students arrival. I myself is a friend of Asher, the landlord of the houses, and he told me that he'd rather rent his houses to international students coz they are quiet and trouble-free. But Asher experienced a hard time finding suitable tenants (international students come and go especially after graduation and it is hard to rent out a house as whole) this summer, he then had to find a group of local students to fill in. 'Nightmare' came to us from then on.

The guys regularly hold BIG party during weekends and every time they have party, the yard is full of over ONE HUNDRED young people. Too much trash and too loud noise! I talked to the organizers and they told me that it is their fraternity house. I felt insane as fxxk, I do know where is the frat street near USC okay?! My family have been lived here for around 30 years and it is the first time I felt the local students from USC is so troublesome.

I know it might be a little bit unbiased but I have to say I 'd rather be the neighbor with quiet international students as before. I will support any regulation that can attack and remain them here.
