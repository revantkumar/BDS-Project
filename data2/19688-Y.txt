I am an international student who is graduating soon.

This opt stem regulation provides some kind of relief to smart and talented international students with a stem major. What is more, it provides must boost to U.S. economy. Some classmates of mine just got bored and inpatient about the inaction of politicians to fix the immigration reform of keeping highly skilled foreign workers. Thus, they decided to go back to their home country to start their company there instead of staying in U.S. to start one or work for one start-up. If more forced to do so, this will affect not only the high tech industry but also they would rather not seek higher education in U.S.. To secure a job or build connections, they think they would rather study in their home country. Just consider how many international student flock to colleges and graduate schools in U.S., especially those public schools who need international students much more urgently. 

Thus, no matter from what perspective, international students and foreign skilled workers will do more good than bad.

We welcome this kind of stem opt regulation and do urge pass it immediately. We also hope there would be a better solution instead of a fix to immigration problem.
