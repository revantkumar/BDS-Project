I am supporting this Rule, this is going to benefit both US and the students who spend lot of money to get educated. As some people worried, this rule is no way going to effect any of the US citizens, employers interview people before they take them. If the person is productive, then the employer will definitely prefer the best person with best skills. People who works hard and talented will have better opportunity and they deserve it. It depends completely on the personal skills and talent.
