Expanding the OPT opportunities for international students has several positive impact to US society:

1. Many technology and engineering companies rely on OPT as a buffer to H1B visa restriction. And many positions can only be filled by talented international students,especially in STEM field. Hiring international students for those positions won't affect employment for US citizens.

2. Many students working on OPT contribute a considerable amount of fortune to USA such as taxes. And expanding STEM OPT will encourage more international students to come to USA for their education therefore bringing in more financial revenue for USA schools.
