I strongly agree to extend opt time. More time for opt means international students can stay in U.S. longer than before, and companies will have more choices to pick and hire employees. This will help make a healthier completion environment in the U.S. and companies under this will have more talented employees and develop faster, and finally the economy in the U.S will be better and better.
