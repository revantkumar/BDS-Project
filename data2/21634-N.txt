Greetings from Steve a Chemical Engineer.

Plans to increase OPT are bad for the United States of America:
A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

PLANS TO INCREASE OPT ARE BAD FOR AMERICAN STUDENTS AND WOULD DEMOTIVATE THEM GOING INTO STEM:
But on a much more personal level, why would I as a successful Technical Fellow in my field encourage United States Citizen students to pursue STEM? 

Clearly the OPT is being misused to get cheap high tech labor from foreign countries trained and then KEPT in the United States. What this means for citizen students is that they can look forward to low paying jobs if they do the exceptionally hard work of getting a technical degree. OPT removes the technical incentive and the ability for American students to pay back their loans. 

TAXPAYER MONEY IS BEING USED TO CREATE JOB LOSS AND WAGE DEPRESSION FOR CITIZENS:
Who benefits from OPT? Taxpayers will pay billions of dollars (see above) so that their children can be unemployed or payed low wages if they go into STEM. Meanwhile those billions of dollars of taxpayer money allow American businesses to get wildly cheap labor. Shouldn't business shoulder the cost of importing and training labor for them to use? Why should taxpayers shoulder that burden for businesses who have no loyalty to American citizens?

DESPITE SELF-SERVING CLAIMS OF LOW LEVELS OF TECH WORKERS, IN REALITY THE UNEMPLOYMENT IN ENGINEERING IS ALREADY HIGH DUE TO THE MISCHIEF OF OPT.

IT IS TIME TO PUT OUR AMERICAN STUDENTS AND WORKERS IN HIGH TECH FIELDS FIRST.
IT IS NEVER APPROPRIATE FORCE TAXPAYERS TO FUND POLICIES THAT RESULT IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND WAGE DEPRESSION TO THE BENEFIT OF COMPANIES WHO HAVE NO LOYALTY TO AMERICA OR HER CITIZENS.
