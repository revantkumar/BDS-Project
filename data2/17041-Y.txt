I support this proposal. I don't think we can have more job opportunities if the international students leave US. We may replace some of the employment from them. But there is still a hole we cannot fill in, resulting in harming our economics and eventually losing our business. In short term, we may have several job opportunities available for US citizens, but in the end we could lose more.
