I am from the mid south, and I see everyday how our workers are not able to find good jobs. Making it easier for foreign workers
to replace American workers is ridiculous. 
In these times of increased terror threats, it is also foolish to continue to flood our country with foreign persons when we cannot 
track the people here now. 
This program will lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.
DHS is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT
workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field;
how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment.
This will expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap,
which gives them an advantage over American workers.
Because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around
$10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program. This will further reduce the amounts paid into the system and add
to the demise of the Social Security system. 
I am very much opposed to such a program. Until our unemployment issues are solved, and our backlog of current immigrant 
visa violations is addressed, we do not need to encourage employment of foreign workers.
