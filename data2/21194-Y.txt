As an international student, I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. The international students spend double money and double time to gain knowledge and skills. We deserve more opportunities and times to practice our skills.

2. Almost everybody in the world think that America is a country which the most open and freedom. Everyone came to United States should have equal chances and opportunities. Also, as everyone known that United Stated is a migration country, and it can become the most active country because the American people and migration people's hard working and cooperation.

3. More migration people chooses to conduct their owned business in America, it will bring more work opportunities to American people. Longer OPT will attract more talented students come to America, some of them in the future probably will establish next Google, next Microsoft. Please do not only think about the next day, please think about the next five year, next decade.
