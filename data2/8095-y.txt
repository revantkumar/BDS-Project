Roger Carr I am completely and utterly opposed to any expansion of STEM OPT programs.
The STEM OPT program should be eliminated entirely, not expanded.

Any program like this, which preferentially benefits foreign students in their competitiveness with newly educated, job seeking American students is using American resources (or waiving collection of tax resources) to disadvantage American students and new grads.

Extending the STEM OPT program for foreign students challenges American students through additional competition for scarce jobs, diminishes American students ability to afford, and complete their education, and creates a low-cost preference for employers to hire aliens over Americans.
Whoever conceived of this proposal and considered it a good idea should be removed from government "service".

Why would such a program be suggested, other than to enhance competition against Americans, and to support foreign nationals?
