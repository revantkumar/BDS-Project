XinYu Dong I'm a member of the STEM students group. I'm learning the Computer Engineering in UF and I support the proposal. 
In my researching aspect, I can hardly see any American student -- maybe more in undergraduate level, but not in graduate level. Most of us are from China and India. And this is not an uncommon situation in American universities. Our tuition fee is much higher than general American students, which definitely contribute a lot to the fundings. 
Secondly, we come to America for knowledge, for experience, nothing else. I've seen so many comments emphasizing that they shouldn't allow F1 students to immigrate to the United States. Here I want to ask, "Why do we have to immigrate to America?!" My hometown, China, is developing in such a high speed - especially in Electronic area. This means much much more opportunities for us to go back to China compared to stay in America. Those commenters should learn more about the world before leaving any useful comment.
