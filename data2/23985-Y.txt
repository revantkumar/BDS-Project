As a F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degree, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason.
1. As a master student, experience is very important for us. However, most of masters in US are all taking classes. We seldom have chance to have projects with professor like PHD student. So the work experience after our graduation is really important. But the 12 months(maybe less) OPT period is even not enough for us to get familiar with our job. How can we get enough work experience in shortly 12 months? In our own country, the 3-year master degree mode is quite similar to the PHD degree in US, which means, they already have 3 years project or work experience right after their graduation. That makes the US master student really disadvantaged when seeking job together with them in job market. And STEM extension program can make us get competitive in the job market. The STEM extension program is an important reason for us to decide to achieve degrees in US. And this policy is cancelled, it will cause a lot of students give up their plan to study in US and choose some other country like Canada and England, or just achieve degree in our country. So the extension is really important for our future career and development.

2. I think in a country like US, diversity is very important. For example, international companies may have sites outside US. If they have employees from these countries, they may have some useful suggestions. And in US history, a lot of huge contributions are made by foreigners who had US education background. Assume they didn't get chance to work in US, we could not live the life like that. STEM extension program means give STEM students a chance to contribute to US for a longer time.

All in all, STEM extension is really important for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students like myself and I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.
