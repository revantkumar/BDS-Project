This is unacceptable. Foreign workers are already flooding the IT and high tech marketplace, thus drastically reducing the pay rate for all of us. There is not a deficiency of high tech workers. We don't need foreigners to fill jobs. We have enough high tech and IT professionals already here. We definitely do not need to increase competition for the few jobs that are available. Instead of making it easier to work in the US, you should be making it harder to take jobs from the existing US citizens. 

Your job is to support and protect those that voted you into office. You job is to protect American jobs. Don't you realize that by flooding the high tech market with unneeded foreign workers, you are displacing a whole sector of citizens that are highly skilled and educated.

We no longer manufacture anything in the US. It has all been outsourced. We have very little left to protect. You have a responsibility to the voters and the citizens of this country to allow jobs in the US to go to US Citizens. There is no need to import additional tech workers. Despite what you may believe, or what others may have told you, there is no deficiency of legal US citizens as applicants for high tech jobs in the US. I have been in the field now for over 20 years. I know.
