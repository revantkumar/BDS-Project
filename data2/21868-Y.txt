OPT extension is ABSOLUTELY needed. Not allowing students with a PhD or Masters degree will only be a great loss after US taxpayers have spend thousands of dollars towards their degree. Consider a student who has US Masters or PhD degree, the school has paid tuition fees and scholarship for the student upto amount of 60,000 $ per year! Multiply this number with 2 years for Masters degree and 5 years or more for PHD degree. Making the students leave after US top universities have trained them to be the best and invested120,000$ to 300,000$ is really stupid. This rule should be made mandatory so that these students are allowed to contribute to US economy and not create competition by going back to their home country.

Additionally the fact that H1B is going for a lottery for three consecutive years speaks for itself the dire need for STEM graduates. In the absence of parliament failing to pass an immigration law, this rule is essential. 17 month extension rule was initially implemented as an emergency rule because of H1B lottery. And the situation has not changed. USCIS is still holding lottery to give visas to even PHD degree holders for the past three years. Absence of such rule will only mean acute business loss for US.
