Jian Yu I Strongly support the new OPT extension. It serves well to US' national interests.

1. OPT extension will greatly enhance US domestic consumption. According to NAFSA, in 2013-2014, international students contributed $26.8B to US economy and created more than 340,000 job opportunities.

2. OPT extension also can help the development of high-tech industry. Many famous high-tech companies were founded by international graduates during their OPT and/or OPT extension time (e.g. Mike Krieger & Instagram). These high-tech companies are very important to both US economy and the nation's leadership in high-tech industry.
