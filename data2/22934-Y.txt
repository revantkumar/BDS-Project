I strongly support this proposal. More talented students have been attracted to study in United States instead of other countries because of the STEM OPT extension. Considering the negative comments on the job competition brought by OPT extension, it is obvious that there would not be such a competition because OPT STEM extension only applies to e-verified companies, which guarantees that the employers would not discriminate against anyone during the hiring process. Under the equal opportunity agreement, it would not make sense to blame to job competition on STEM OPT extension. 

I strongly support this proposal because STEM students do need the extension for the projects/research they are working on. Many projects would last for more than 1 year and the extension gives sufficient time if their projects are not finished within 1 year after graduation.
