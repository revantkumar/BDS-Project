Ariana zhao I strongly recommend opt extension. 
No matter whether we admit it or not, international students have better technique skills than local american people. 
The american government already do a lot to protect americans right to work. And companies always prefer us citizen than international students.
American is built out of immigrations. The situation is already so hard for international students, so why should not US government give opt extension to them. To give them more opportunity to contribute to American.
