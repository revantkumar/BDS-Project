I strongly support OPT extension proposal.

Throughout the history of US, international students have made invaluable contribution to the US economy, education and innovation as a whole. To name a few well-known examples, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Shantanu Narayen, current CEOs of google, Microsoft, Adobe respectively, and Jerry Yang, one key co-founder of Yahoo, are all foreign-born used-to-be international students who obtained advanced degrees in US and all went through the phase of OPT. Without existence of OPT, these people would not have made the huge contribution and impact to US tech industry, instead they would have come back to their own countries and started tech companies in their own countries using what they learnt from US graduate schools, which in turn become competitors with US companies. In addition to these big names, there are hundreds of thousands of international students in STEM majors that become important workforce for US companies.

Take a glance on a larger scale. According to wikipedia, 27 out the 87 (more than 30%) American Nobel Prize winners in Medicine and Physiology between 1901 and 2005 were born outside the US, many of whom obtained PhD degrees from universities in US. According to a NY Times article in 2011, "The number of international scholars working at colleges and universities in the United States as researchers, instructors and professors rose to 115,000 last year, an all-time high, from 86,000 in 2001." And this number continues to grow since then. Not to mention that, for almost all STEM majors, international students take up at least 40% of the whole body of graduate students, which contribute hugely to the advancement of science and technology. Without existence of OPT, these again will be completely impossible.
