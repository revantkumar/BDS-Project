Qingyun Bian To me, it seems that the comments trend is fairly predictable. From Americans' point of view, this proposal would taking the jobs from their hands. From international students' point of view, this proposal will be a life saver. However, from the US government's point of view, this proposal retains the brightest minds from all over the world, increases US's overall education level and boosts economy in the long run. 

Relying on the comments will most likely lead to revoking the proposal. Yet analyzing rationally based on the country's welfare, the conclusion we get will be entirely different.
