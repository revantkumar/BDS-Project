I strongly support OPT Ext rule. Nonimmigrant students have right to pursue equal opportunity. Many students contribute to their talent to IT, engineering and other science fields. Longer OPT will attract more talent students to stay in US, which is definitely good for US economy. Longer OPT is a win-win policy.
