The American labor force is sitting around collecting checks from me and your constituents. It is so wrong to not place the American first-every single time-until the Employer has exhausted the entire available labor pool.
Do you even know what the skilled labor pool breakdown by job is/are sitting on the sidelines instead of working? How about the number of job openings/postings for the VA Centers in Redding and Chico, Ca. They both need at least two doctors and two more lab techs. Do you care?
Please keep Americans first in all Job Plans.
