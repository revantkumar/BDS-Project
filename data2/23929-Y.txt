Please stop the madness! We have American students who can do this work and should be doing this work. 

You are going to be "requiring the implementation of formal mentoring and training plans by employers, adding wage and other protections for STEM OPT students and U.S. workers, and allowing extensions only to students with degrees from accredited schools." This should encourage the employment of U.S. workers and students.

The last paragraph states in part that the aim of this program is to "prevent(ed) adverse effects to U.S. workers." This will be done "By earning a functional understanding of how to apply their academic knowledge in a work setting, students will be better positioned to begin careers in their fields of study. These on-the-job educational experiences would be obtained only with those employers that commit to developing students' knowledge and skills through practical application. The proposed changes would also help ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States." 

All of these last items should be devoted to U.S. students and workers. Let's pour our resources into them and export them to the world!
