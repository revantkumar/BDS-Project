Very positive initiative from DHS. As a nation we should support such efforts. 
STEM workers are backbone of our rapidly growing economy, and any arrogance on our side will lead to our own downfall. 
As an employer, I have never looked for a foreign national where I could find a US citizen. It is a lot more risky and paperwork to hire foreign nationals and on top of that they cannot work on certain projects, not to mention short term commitment.
