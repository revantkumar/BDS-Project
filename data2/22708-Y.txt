I *strongly support* this rule for the following rules:
First, everyone deserves equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study should have more time to practice their skills after graduation.
Second, it's good for US economy to have more talented people to work in different areas.
Last but not least, this is good for US education system since longer OPT will for sure attract more talented students coming to study in US.
