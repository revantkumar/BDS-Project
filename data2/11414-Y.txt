Support this rule. Notice: this rule doesn't help foreigners getting hired in U.S., it just LET THOSE FOREIGNER STUDENTS WHO ALREADY FOUND JOB COULD WORK A LITTLE BIT LONGER. It's not a big deal to Americans, it won't really affect any U.S. citizens finding a job, but impact pretty much on foreign students who could contribute a great deal to U.S. companies/institutes.
