I. OPT will discourage F-1 students, which could lead to follows...

Without the F-1 students who pay high amount of tuition, how many US citizens are still able to get college education with financial aid?

Without the F-1 students, many local restaurants and markets would lose lots of money.

II. OPT students is NOT TAKING AWAY ANYONE'S JOB - tech companies DO NOT tend to employ more international students, because the paying is EXACTLY THE SAME as US citizens. The only fluctuation (eg, 105k vs 100k per year) is caused by difference in individual ability only. 
If you are arguing that us students are less desired by tech companies, then I assume you are implying most US students are not as competitive as most international students. In that case, even if OPT extension is cancelled, people overseas will still take up the spots.

III. If OPT extension is cancelled, a large number of engineers would have to go back to their homecountry AT THE SAME TIME (around February 2016, I believe). That will cause A HUGE HOLE in all tech companies' human resources, and these companies would have to spend lots of money and time to fill up the shortage. And that could LET DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SLOW DOWN BY HUGE EXTENT. Which, will definitely affect lives of you and me.
