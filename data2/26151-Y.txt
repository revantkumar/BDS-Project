I am strongly support the OPT extension for nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. As a graduate student approaching the end of my Ph.D. study majoring in chemistry, I have been fully prepared for becoming a research scientist and working in pharmaceutical companies in U.S for at least the next three years rather than 12 months! It would be extremely difficult for any fresh Ph.D. like me to build our career in the STEM field within a year or two. Without OPT extension, I could hardly image how could I make any contribution to U.S. in such limited timeframe by applying the best knowledge I have eventually learned during 5 years of my doctoral degree.
