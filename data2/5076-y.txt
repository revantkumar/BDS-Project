Jack Wu I strongly support this plan.

If this extension doesn't got approved. There will be much less international students willing to come to US for a STEM degree. Because one year is simply not enough to build up their experience to find jobs in their home country. They may go to Canada, or to Australia, or to Japan. But not US. This will greatly damage US higher education. There will be loss of diversity, loss of financial benefits (international students pay higher tuitions), and most of all, loss of talent.

What is more, this will bring collateral damage to US economy. Because international students bring vitality to the local communities by spending on hoursing, eating, and all other services.
