International students who got their OPT and a job are mostly well trained and highly knowledgeable in their domain of study. Most of them could do very well in their home country. The future of US depends on how many talented people it has working for it. One-year-long OPT is simply too short and equivalent to driving those talent out of the US. Last year only one third of international students were able to get H1B work visa, which means two thirds of them had to leave U.S. even though they were doing terrific job propelling the US economy. This is directly against the American Dream, which give every immigrant a chance to prove themselves, rather than letting them take a chance in the H1B lottery. A two year extension of OPT is really necessary to give every student a fair chance to prove their value and pursue their American Dream.

Some people argue that OPT is depriving them jobs. It is gross ignorance and simple short-sighted to say that. International students stay here to build American companies and help them compete in the global economy. This will ultimately bring more jobs to the U.S. citizens. If international students were to return to their home country and compete against U.S. companies and drive them out of business, more U.S. citizens will lose their job. Simple think what if Japanese cars crushed American cars world wide, what if Korean and Chinese smartphones outsell Apple. 

In short, a two year OPT extension aligns with the American Dream and will generate jobs for U.S. citizens. For the interest of both international students and american, please approve it.
