This new policy should be passed, and U.S. will benefit from that.

As we all know, foreign students are the majority in engineering school. For some universities, even more than 80% of engineering students are from other countries. That means, there are few U.S. citizens study in that area. And if government does not expand OPT, U.S. will lose about one hundred thousand engineers, at the beginning of next year. Moreover, there is no way to find people to replace them. Many companies would have difficulty to recruit. Then, factories will move to other countries which have more talented person. Less factories, less jobs. So gathering more engineers can create far more jobs for U.S. and boost the economy. 

Also, longer OPT period is a good message for international students. It can absorb more talented students come here and it is helpful for the high education of U.S. . Losing those students might risks the leading position of U.S. in high tech area, and even might destroys the education.

International students are young, energetic, and ambitious. They are valuable and precious every country. So government should issue more policies and regulations to keep them here. If not, they will leave and build other countries.
