The expansion of the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program is an outrageous attack on American workers, especially recent science and engineering graduates - it should be cancelled immediately. This scam enables DHS to designate college graduates as foreign students. Foreign students don't pay payroll taxes. And neither does the employer. The employer is exempt from paying the 6.2% Social Security and 1.45% Medicare taxes. That nearly 8 percent difference means an employer can save money by hiring a foreigner over an American. This is a blatant screw job on the American tax payer - the OPT should be ended immediately.
