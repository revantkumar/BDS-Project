There is no google, intel, Goldman Sachs or i would say we Wont have a silicon valley without educated immigrants in the STEM fields. 
The comments where people say immigrants are stealing jobs from american citizens.
I find this statement preposterous this extension is for those highly educated people who are at already advanced technical jobs. why were these people hired in the first place? 
because the qualifications and requirements are very high level that american citizens are unable to fill them. This proposal will not take away jobs from american citizens but rather we as immigrants want to create new industries, technologies, companies in the future and create jobs for the american people. I strongly support this extension of 24 monthsOPT for STEM students educated in the US
