Lynne Vanahill Please see my attached comments for specific details. As a PDSO at a large, research institution with over 2200 Active F-1 records in SEVIS, I welcome this proposed regulation. Overall, I am strongly in support of this proposal. I think the benefits outweigh the costs and this will strengthen the U.S. economy and increase opportunities for STEM students. Likewise, it will make the U.S. more marketable world wide in our quest to recruit highly qualified international students.
