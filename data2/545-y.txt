Albert Lee I'm a US citizen, this time I stand for foreign STEM students. I mean, students that are competitive in the area of science, technology, engineering and math. The reason is very simple. If this rule doesn't pass through, I heard there will be 40000+ smart students to be DEPORTED to their country next Feb. This is a very very negative sign that America is attracting smart people who can really contribute to the science and technology development. It's also very bad for US education if this rule doesn't pass.
