I think this is a very helpful rule for STEM international students, technology companies and even national economy of the USA.
1. For students, 12 months OPT may not be enough for them to really apply enough what they learn into practice given that they need to do projects in companies. If a longer extension is allowed, it definitely is beneficial.
2. For companies, especially tech companies, they need these highly educated immigrants to work for them. The best way for them to select the best employees is through a longer period of internship, which OPT extension makes possible. A lot of the projects they have are like 2 to 3 years. If international students do not have the OPT extension, they might not be able to finish the project and their companies will need to spend huge amount money to train another person for the project.
3. These companies are the core of USA's modern economy, while most of their research & development employees are immigrants. If these companies cannot have more great students through the OPT and OPT extension period, their work quality and even profit could suffer! If these companies all suffer due to the rejection of OPT extension, USA's economy could be hugely affected.
Thank you. I really hope the government can think about the OPT extension seriously and embrace its benefits.
