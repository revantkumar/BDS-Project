The OPT extension increases to 24 months from 17 months is very necessary for this country, I strongly support this proposal to be accepted. 

As in my research field of nanomaterials, among the top ten scientists in U.S., seven of them were not born in the U.S.. International scientists and engineers are one of the reasons why this country can still keep its leading position in the world. 

Plus, most of the international students, especially for those with advanced STEM degrees have been well trained during their graduate studies, so that they can contribute directly to the development of this country. Data shows that employing one of these STEM advanced degree students will create seven potential jobs for the country. This means that more advanced degree holders we employ, the more jobs we are creating for all the U.S. citizens. So why not?

The OPT extension won't benefit those non high technology jobs, and instead it is creating more 'normal' job opportunities for everyone in U.S.!
