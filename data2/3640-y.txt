SHIXIAO LI Chinese and Indian students are the majority of my maths, statistics and computer science classes. They study very hard and raise good questions. If we can provide more opportunities to them, they can use whatever they learn in classes which will build our university's reputation. Our professors also want their students can do interesting job in US. If all international students go back to their countries, our professors can rarely see what their students are doing. It's also a waste of our education.

This policy is not saying every foreign students will stay in US FOREVER. It's just about providing more opportunities. Qualified students will stay and help US become better and increase the GDP. The extension is not very long. Why not give it a try? It will do favor for the country, the university, and the student. 

Thanks a lot.
