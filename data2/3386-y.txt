Michael Glaze A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership and quantitative skills. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. This rule is very beneficial for retaining talented international students. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
