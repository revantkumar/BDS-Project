There is a growing anger going on out in middle America and the press totally ignores it and passes on the lies Washington gives them...We took the Democrats out of power in the Senate and the House in the last election because they just did not listen to us....We will continue to clean house until you start representing the people who actually pay the bills...I was a lifelong Democrat now I will vote against rather than for.
