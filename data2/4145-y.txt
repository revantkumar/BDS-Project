Neil M. Lorber, Ph.D. I am against expansion of the Optional Practical Training program. I am against the Dept. of Homeland Security's proposing a rule that would have this expansive effect.

Such an expansion would allow certain tech companies here to hire foreign students for as many as 3 years and avoid paying their normal share of payroll taxes for that entire period.. 

Our own college graduates cannot presently find employment !
