I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am a international graduate student and will graduate next year. In my opinion, it is obvious that it will a win-win rule for both U.S. and we foreign students.

Those STEM students all have experienced background education in the U.S. U.S spent time, teacher source, lab facilities and many resources to train and educate international student. I think these students have excellent technology skills which can take more advantage to U.S economy. They are legal tax payers! They can bring more value to economy for U.S. Yes, they contribute to the economy as much as, if not more, than US citizens.
