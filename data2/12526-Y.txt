As an international master student, I want to say the tuition fee and some of the living expenses are covered fully or partially by a fund from the university. This is eventually paid by all tax payers, that is, every American. If we force these students to return to their home country right after graduation, we are effectively using our tax-payers' money to educate future workers for our competitors. This will definitely hurt the USA in the very near future and we should figure out a way to fix it. OPT extension is a temporary way to deal with this.
