In Silicon Valley, the percentage of immigrant-founded companies has declined by 8.5 percent since 2005, the first such drop in recent history. Many attribute the decline to U.S. immigration policy. Companies are in a global competition for talent, and other countries are rolling out the red carpet for them while we are rolling out the red tape. The U.S. and Silicon Valley are still the places to be, but if Congress doesn't act soon, that won't last for very long. (5). Tech workers are the life blood of our industry and as such we need to continue to do all that we can to ensure access to the best and brightest workers in the world. This means focusing on STEM education, training and improving access to high-skilled immigrants. They are going to be the future drivers of our industry.
