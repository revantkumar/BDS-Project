I support the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and help US to keep top talent from leaving to competitive countries like China. Every year, many talented young STEM student leave US because there is not enough H1b VISA. This extension will give these student more chance to contribute to our economy. This policy has tremendous positive impact on the future of our country. It is vital to keep the talents.
