The debate rests on whether the extension yields benefit for not only F1 students but also U.S. society. I think it's apparently beneficial if F1 students with STEM have more time to choose the most appropriate occupation. Because they are usually high tech work force, they as a group will generate more social welfare than they cost. America needs such high tech work force to achieve growth. Especially nowadays U.S. people are still trying to recover the economy, so it's not wise to suddenly cut off such work force.
