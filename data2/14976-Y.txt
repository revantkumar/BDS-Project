It is a non-ignorable fact that the international students with advanced degrees in STEM have a huge contribution to US economy. In 2014, the growth in international students coming to the U.S. for higher education had a significant positive economic impact on the United States. International students contributed more than $27 billion to the U.S. economy, which corresponds to a 12 percent increase versus 2013 ($24 billion), according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. In most IT companies at Silicon valley, the international students have been the major working force. It will be a disaster for US economy if these talented students are forced to leave US. I strongly SUPPORT that the extension of OPT for STEM students should be 24 months.
