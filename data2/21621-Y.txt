Please do not enact this proposed rule and please bring the Optional Practical Training program to an end. I know first hand that there is a glut, not a shortage, of Americans who are interesting in studying and working in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations. I am a Ph.D. candidate in physics at the University of Kansas. Before attending Kansas, I received my M.S. in physics at a school in a department where at least 40% of the graduate students were foreign. During this time, I saw native-born classmates who were strong students get turned down from all of the Ph.D. programs in physics that they had applied to. I myself only was accepted to 2 out of 8 programs I applied to when I went for my M.S. and 2 of 7 when I applied for Ph.D. programs. The inescapable conclusion here is that not only are there a large number of Americans who are interested in STEM study and occupations, but that these Americans are being denied opportunities to pursue studies and careers in STEM due to the very large foreign presence of STEM students and workers. Please allow Americans who are interested in and have been encouraged to pursue STEM careers the opportunities they were told they would have.
