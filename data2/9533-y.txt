Adrian Slater You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. Based on the experience of last few decades, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields. They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
