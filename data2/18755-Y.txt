Great! I don't know why those person want to restrict the time for the stems students working for US? Will they make us lose opportunities? Absolutely not! They will make our companies more competitive! Looking for the computer field, which give most chances to OPT student, also help lots of american find the working opportunities. And we can find in nearly five years, when we provide more and more chances for opt students, the unemployment rate decreasing into 6%? So I really curious why some people want to restrict stems student? I think most of them want everybody be a lazy guy and do nothing only talking, like them. And they want to ruin the whole computer field, make this field stop increasing and finally, just like 5 or 10 years ago, we cannot find many stems student, also most american cannot find a job, and I think these people will fell happy!
