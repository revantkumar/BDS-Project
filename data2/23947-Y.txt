I really believe it is important for OPT to have an extended period. It is essential for the United States of America to give everybody a equal opportunity as it is a free land. The extended period could attract more high level genius into US and help it to build a better society as well as bringing the technology forward. Education is an important part of US development as is the advertisement for the whole country. If the rule does get through, there would be more talented people coming in when they know for sure that they will have a pretty good chance to secure a job in US.
