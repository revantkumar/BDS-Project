I would support the proposal since:

1. Government should let the students who learn knowledge in US have a bettern opportunity to make contribution to the United States. This will help improve the efficiency of the entire US society by motivating both the aliens and US citizens. 

2. Here US holds the spirit of freedom and diversity. This policy is one of the application of this US spirit.

3. This could attract more intelligent people come here and join the US which is beneficial to the US in a long term.
