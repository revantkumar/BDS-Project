It is a commendable effort by DHS to act in timely to save the STEM OPT and also increase it by another 6 months . However I wish to bring to your notice why exactly extension to STEM OPT not service the purpose to save foreign stem graduates from being forced to leave USA.

The STEM extension gives us more opportunities to try our luck at the all elusive "H1-B" lottery but we have also seen a significant rise in the number of H1-B applicants each year . Since past 3 years we have seen the CAP being hit less than 5 days . The probability of making it in the H1-B lottery next year is less than 30% even for a STEM Graduate.

It makes no sense for a foreign STEM graduate to move from one non-immigration status to another (F1 to H1-B) . Some people who are unlucky in the lottery may be forced to stay in F1 for 4 years and then have to apply for H1. This delays their Green Card process. We already know how long the queues are especially for asian countries. On the other hand people who enter US through a H1-B Visa can stay up to six years and also apply for a Green Card. 

In countries like Canada and Australia foreign STEM graduates are allowed to apply for permanent residency right after graduation . If USA is to retain the best and brightest it is an imperative to provide foreign graduates with a Green Card. 

In Conclusion i would like to say the 24 months of STEM Extension may not be sufficient to hit the lottery at least once .

However as a temporary relief STEM extension must be increased upto 60 months which makes it on par with H1-B Visa .

In the long run i believe the following steps would ensure that STEM students are benifitted in long run

1) I would like to suggest to remove the CAP on STEM Graduates for H1 - B
2)Allow Green Card to be filed directly on F1 Status(Make F1 a dual intent VISA)
