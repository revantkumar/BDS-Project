This is a very good proposal for both international students and universities in U.S.

For international students, they have more chance to practice what they have learn in universities. And they can also make some money yo cover the cost of daily life and tuition fee, while earning more experience in real work. With more OPT, international students can enjoy more chance to find intern or full time even without H1B visa. And as a result of OPT extension, they will finally have excellent skills. At the same, those students could also create huge value for the society.

On the other side, for universities, there's also lots of benefit. As we know, the standard to evaluate an university is not about whether a student can hunt a job in US, is about whether students can have more chance to learn skills here. The most different between the university in US and other countries is that international students could practice their skill in real work. This benefit will draw more people come to U.S. I believe more international students coming to US, learning knowledge, doing researching, is good for US in every way. But the quality of education will be impact if there is no opt extension any more. 

Therefore, OPT extension is an excellent proposal. I'm very happy to see it could run as a real rule in U.S.
