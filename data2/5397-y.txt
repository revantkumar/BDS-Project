Vinay Rama Limbare I support the extension. 

USA currently has shortage of skilled workers. And it's the foreign students who come to US and study fill the shortage. 

If the extension is not implemented, then international students (F-1) would not come to US to study therefore affecting the economy and also bringing the shortage of workers. Hence all the current work would have to be outsourced, which is also bad for US economy. 

Apart for this, it would personally help the international students to learn and gain more knowledge working here in US. It won't only help to improve their technical skills but also helps in personality development. 

The amount of risk taken by these students and studying in US has to be rewarded in the form of STEM OPT extension since H1B quota is no-where going to increase.
