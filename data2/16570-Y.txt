To state first, I STRONGLY SUPPORT it.

I am so disappointed seeing those negative comments under this proposal. Since when do the American people become so uncomfortable with foreigners and so unconfident in their children and future generations?

America becomes a strong country because of its attractions to the most talent people from all over the world. And why are we avoiding the chance to work with the most talent people?
