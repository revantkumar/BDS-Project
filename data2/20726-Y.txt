I agree for the extension of the OPT for STEM students. The reason is that the OPT is a great opportunity for international students to start a career and also it is a great opportunity for US and US economics. Excellent people are coming to US for further study and they got degrees from universities. They could contribute to the advancement of technology a lot if they have an opportunity.
