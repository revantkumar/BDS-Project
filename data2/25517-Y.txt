Dear Sir

Having sufficient OPT for international students are critical for graduates to gain practical training and is part of the education process. Terminate OPT without getting sufficient training will only do harm to both trainees and the company.

1. Current OPT for STEM is only 12 months, which is too short for students in engineering and other fields to get enough training, getting along with colleagues, and contribute to the company. I have been in OPT once, and I felt that after only a couple of months experiences, I haven't had any chance to use my learnt skills to contribute to the work, then I will have to leave. 

2. An employer usually looking for trainees to be trained for future talent pool and long term development for that company. Insufficient training period will only do harm to both company and the trainee, since they JUST get familiar with each other, then they need to terminate the OPT due to this rule. The incompleteness of training period will leave the company at the risk of losing man-power for promising projects, and will leave the trainee at the risk of losing his/her loyalty to serve a company. 

Therefore, I strongly support extending the OPT.

Sincerely

Chuan Sun
