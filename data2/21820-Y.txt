Smart move. Historically, US has been accepting most talented people from all over the world to assist with our science and culture, and that is why US has been and will be the richest and most powerful country in the world. We have the best Universities around the globe, attracting smartest students from all nations. After spending our money to train them for five years, it is just ridiculous to let them leave to help our competitors. Any savvy people would try their best to keep those talents within america to help US stay in the leading position in the world. 

Some people are worried about losing their jobs due to those students. Come on! Have you imagined how many jobs we would lose if all those companies led by foreign origins moved into other countries? Those talents create jobs rather than consume jobs.
