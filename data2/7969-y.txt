Nan Zheng The OPT STEM is not only important to the international students who just graduated from the US universities, but also to the American companies and industries. Majority of students at OPT status are graduated with MS and PhD degrees. They have strong knowledge background and high technical skills. They are precious talents who can contribute a lot to the economic development to the American society. They are qualified employees and can provide big support to the tax fund. The employers may also have more options when they are looking for desired employees since the international students occupy a big portion in the graduate schools. In addition, without OPT STEM, these people will have to leave this country. The tourists to American will dramatically decrease after that because no family or friends are here.
I also feel, the employers have the power to choose whom to hire. This has no relation to the STEM. Some people said the foreigners occupied many job opportunities. That means they have the advantage over the native citizen or they would like to work whatever native people don't. The foreigners may bring more and bigger benefits and profits in some respects.
