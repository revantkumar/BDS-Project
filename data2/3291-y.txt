Alex Liu I strongly SUPPORT the Opt extension program. 

1. The F1 students with STEM degree make a lot of contribution to the development of American's high tech.

2. They pay a lot of tax to the government.

3. Without the OPT extension, a lot of companies will lose a lot of employees and their development will be restricted.
