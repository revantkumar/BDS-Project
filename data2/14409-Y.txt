I once worked with some foreign graduate student in a tech company, and I was the only guy who is an undergraduate American student, all others are graduates and the company will only allow the international students with at least master degrees to get into the company. When I was there and when I heard that only International graduate students are get enrolled, I already feel the unfairness in the job market for non-US. But I am not proud of benign treated as an US citizen, actually, I am a little shamed of the companies who has separate employment policy for different people. All I heard about in the university or in the news and even in the debate is that US really appreciate fairness. But when come into the job market, everything is different. As a colleague of those international students, I found them really smart and hard-working people, they do really good job and they are nice to me. I really enjoy working with them. I hardly believe that without those ones, these company can last long. This is only a small part of the US economy. In general, if we let those smart hardworking guys to go back to their own country and do not even have a chance to make a life in US, US will not be as the most attractive educational and working place around the world. They came here mostly because they believe in American dream, that if they work hard they can earn a life here. That is the spirit of the US, and Let's Just keep that tradition. If we cannot even give a well educated ones a chance to fulfill his or her American Dream, how can we promise An American Dream to everyone ???????
