US economy and high-tech companies does need those well-educated STEM students. They are top talents from their own countries, companies need their knowledge and skills to compete globally and are willing to hire them at a high compensation level, one-third of their income goes to federal and state tax. This is a healthy ecosystem. I believe if natives have same level of skill sets, they will definitely get much better offers.
