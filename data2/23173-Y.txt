Dear Immigration Officers,

My name is Zhong Wang. I am currently a software engineer at Apple. I joined Apple 3 months ago, and would like to share some of my personal experience related to this proposal.

First of all, I would support this decision, because students from different countries have different characteristics, and they will bring in new blood to the industry. A lot of Chinese students like me are interested in data and infrastructure work. We are good at dealing with details, while my American colleagues are more excited about new features and applications. I think foreign students are actually complimentary instead of competition in the job market.

Second, both of American and foreign students have the same dream, which is making the world a better place to live. The rapid growth of technology industries really changes the world a lot, and makes the world more and more open. I really hope to have opportunities, to learn more advanced knowledge in US tech companies, to make contributions to the improvement of human society.

I think this proposal will offer a great opportunity connecting students from all over the world together, learning from working in the most advanced tech companies in the world, and making contributions to human society.

Best Regards,
Zhong
