I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reason:

What makes U.S. the most powerful country in the world is its ability to absorb the brilliant minds in the world.

It has been proved that countless foreigners stayed in the country because the extended OPT gave them enough time to make contributions to this country.

Thus the approval of this proposal is a great benefit to the U.S. economy.
