As a current H1B visa holder, I strongly support this new policy. International students are making huge contribution to this country. Without the new OPT extension policy, a lot of new employee using OPT may have to leave the country in 1 year if they are not selected in the H1B visa application. That means US companies have to lose a lot of talented new employees and the money and time they used to recruit and train those new employees are totally wasted.
