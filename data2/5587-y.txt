Bonnie Jean Fulcher I am opposed to expanding the time allowed for foreign students to train in America. I believe it is helpful for them to get a job when they return to their countries and that is the purpose. However, extending this not only keeps these same job opportunities from American College students who also need entry level positions and it allows for the possibility for the foreign student to remain here; which is not the original intent of the program. Less taxes are collected which also hurts our economy. This only benefits the foreign student. If we had a healthy economy and needed more workers, it might be different... but we do not have a healthy economy. I know many, many college age students who cannot get the jobs they want and in many cases they are taken by foreign students in such programs. There need to be limits to helping the foreign students and more opportunities for American Students and for our economy to grow through taxes being paid. Please help American Workers first ! Or the opportunities will die out altogether if our economy fails.
