Absolutely outrageous! ! ! 

The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months
in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit 
them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM
students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation
of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's almost
impossible now for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even
more difficult by adding unnecessary and unwanted job competition to the mix. This is an obvious effort to circumvent
the intentions of Congress.
As to the author(s) of this plan...................unfortunately some folks don't have the sense the Good Lord gave to an 
animal cracker.
