I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension.It's short sighted for the US government to decrease the international students' opportunities to work in America just because they aren't citizens.
Actually, most citizens or their ancestors were immigrants. They leave their hometown and help build today's America. There's no reason for so-called native people to keep international students from create welfare, especially the highly educated students.
