Auria Wanson Most international STEM student want to go back to their home countries in the future, the extension of internship period not only have benefit for the students but most importantly benefits USA. The country doesn't pay as much as citizens for students but could acquire equal or more. If opt could extend to 24 months, there will be much less students need sponsors. I think it's better for the country.
