Fei Wang I firmly support the OPT extension and I strongly believe the new OPT extension is the absolutely right choice to US government. 

Firstly, USA employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. 

Secondly, international students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.

Lastly, competition from the STEM talent is a good thing to US people, since it will bring diverse views and creativity.Without competition, the whole society will not make progress and the USA may lose its power in the world.

To sum up, no matter from the viewpoint of economy or the competition benefits, the new OPT extension will be of great significance to STEM talents and US.
