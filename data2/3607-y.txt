Eshwar Narayan I strongly support this rule. The American economy is benefiting on the whole with new foreign students coming to study in top universities in the USA. The STEM OPT attracts foreign students to come study and gain practical experience working with great minds in the college and corporations. The tuition fees paid by the foreign students helps educational institutions to expand their research and development operations and also infuse forex into the US economy. Students also get great exposure under world renowned professors and will get a chance to work at top tech firms. Many of these students have gone ahead and filed patents and invented new products for American companies increasing their revenues and financial reports. This in turn helps to boost the American economy. If OPT is cancelled - this will deter foreign students from coming to US and paying huge fees at the educational institutions. They ll go back to their native country without any proper work experience to show and they ll struggle. So foreign students wont take the risk of coming to US for higher studies.
