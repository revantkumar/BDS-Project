This proposed rule is really benefit for the economic growth of the U.S, since as we all know that IT companies contribute a lot to the U.S tax and there are more and more start-ups in this field need STEM students to support them and those start-ups need couple years to get in a right way, losing those STEM students means losing start-ups and as a result, losing more potential job opportunities for the U.S citizens. 
Besides, Those STEM students won't take over U.S citizen's job opportunities, because when STEM is defined, it means we need international students to fill in those positions, which also means we don't have enough experts of U.S citizens to take those positions. It also explains why STEM just includes couple majors, not all majors.
Generally, we can not imagine the result when we losing those STEM students. We need IT companies to support our economy, we need start-ups to create more job opportunities, we need scientists to support our country.
