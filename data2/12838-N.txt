If you go to the US Labor Board and review the participation rate you will see that we are close to 40% unemployment for Americans. 62.4% to be exact. Americans need jobs and Congress just printing money does not solve our unemployment problem. Hiring illegal CRIMINALS, and people with HB1 Visas does not put one more American back to work. It is time to put Americans first. We must help America first before we can help any other country and their poor. We have over 20,000 Americans living on skid row in Los Angeles, California. We some of the richest players in Hollywood only a short distance away. They say they support Obama and sharing the wealth. Why are they not cleaning up their own back yard? That is just one city, how many hundreds of thousands are on the streets across America, hungry, thirsty, sick with disease, and homeless. Until we get Americans back to work there should NOT be one illegal CRIMINAL with a job or one HB1 Visa granted until we get America back to work. AMERICANS MUST COME FIRST.
