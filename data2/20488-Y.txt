I support the proposal to extend OPT by the department of Homeland Security. The reasons are:

First of all, staying longer in the US doesn't guarantee landing on a job, while daily spending on rent, food, grocery, tuition etc. is inevitable, not to mention travelling and luxury product spending, which is quite prevailing in foreign students. These spending has greatly inspired the economy and created countless jobs in the US and will inspire it even stronger with the OPT extension.

Secondly, some local people might worried about foreigners stealing US worker's jobs. Well, from my personal experience, if a student can't find a job within 2 years after graduation, an extra two years would help very little, he/she is simply incapable of getting a job!

To summarize, the benefit the extension will bring to the US economy by far exceeds the minor harm from job opportunity competition. Therefore, I strongly support the proposal.
