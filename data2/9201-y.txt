Fan Zhang I strongly agree this proposal given the following reasons:
1,There are lots of programs need longer time to finish, such as a friend of mine who recently participate in a software development in a start-up company, it has a promising future and it won't be finish unless he got more time. And in fact most of the STEM programs supported by national funds need about 3-4 years to be accomplished, so in terms of research need, the extension time is necessary.
2, I'm from China, which is a fast developing country and a fast growing market, now an important focus for many companies. For example, if Facebook want to be successful in China, they inevitably need to hire Chinese students who understand Chinese market and customers. For the benefit of all those employees that could be successful in Chinese STEM area, the extension is needed.
3, The STEM extension helps to keep the US academic capability globally. A lot of students including myself have received many offers from universities from both UK and US. We came to the US because we believe we can get the best resources, education and opportunities. Although most of the private schools' tuition fees are high, we still chose US universities, because we know it is worthwhile. 
4, Most of STEM students want to grain great working experience during the time in the US and go back to their own country. So a 12-month OPT is far from enough. For example before a student can get a job, he/she must have a internship for about 3 months, and after that if he/she show interest in actually working here, it may take several months for the company who want to hire he/she to train him/her. And if he/she only have a 12-month OPT, it's just a few months left before he/she could contribute professional skills to the company, which is less worthwhile for the company.
