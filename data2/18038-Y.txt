I think the proposal of improving and expanding OPT for STEM students is still reasonable and necessary for the development of advanced technology in the US. As far as I know, lots of companies in IT are still lack of high-class and talented labors, which cannot be sufficiently filled with the US citizens. The situation is much worse in the research institutes of IT companies especially. Furthermore, the proposed policy will attract more and more talented people to the America and lower the cost of explicitly inducing high-class labors from abroad. In other words, the policy is not to shrink the job opportunities for the potential citizens, but to fill the gaps of some specific areas. 

As well as stimulating the development of high tech in the US, the proposed policy will also increase the competitive capability of the US from the perspective of attracting the talented or the high-class labor stay in the US and contribution to the US rather than letting them go back to help our opponents. Since we have already provided high quality education to the F1 students, including students from China, India, etc., we should also reap the benefits from their contribution to the relevant companies and in turn the states. In addition, as we know, the consumption capability of the current F1 students from China or India rises dramatically alongside the growth of their countries' economic boost. This will also stimulate our market and create more job openings for the citizens. Therefore, improving and expanding OPT for STEM F-1 students is still an indispensable policy in the foreseeable future.
