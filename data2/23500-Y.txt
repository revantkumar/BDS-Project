I am glad to see this new rule and movement in the US`s immigration policy. Every year, there are more and more international students and scholars who come to US seeking degrees and advanced technologies. As most of those people are pretty talented, I would see a huge benefits if those highly trained and educated people can stay and help the country going forward. So it`s very important that the US government offers those people an opportunity to stay. As we all know the H1B lottery is getting hotter each year, many talents who got well trained and educated in US have to leave the country. This very welcomed new rule can mitigate the situation in some degree, but still, we need to rethink about the overall immigration policy to build a nicer environment to attract talents all over the world to come to US.
