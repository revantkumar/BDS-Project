DHS/USCIS ,

Thank you very much for this change. We really need to amend existing OPT ( 17 months) rule.
Also its really good that OPT status will be automatically extended up to 1st October.

I support this new rule and want to thanks everyone who has made efforts to change it.
God Bless America.
