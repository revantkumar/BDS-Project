I am strongly opposed. Our children will stop going into debt to get stem degrees if wages remain flat and jobs become harder to get. No intelligent child will work hard and go deeply into debt only to compete for jobs where the advantage is held by those who do not contribute to SS or medicare. Colleges will become more dependent on foreign students and will eventually struggle to keep their doors open. This is an immigration plan defined by college admission departments, not a policy for the good for the country. While this program might supply needed labor in the short term, it will crush our ability to compete in a global economy going into the future.
