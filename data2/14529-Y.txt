Great Rule and a must rule I would say. I know some would argue that getting foreigners to work here is a very bad idea. But I beg to differ. US is a diverse country and there are lot of opportunities for everyone. I haven't found any concrete statistics that the immigrations of foreigners have damaged the opportunities for the US citizens. And we must remember that there are some great talents that US imports when foreigners come. Extending the STEM would give students more chances to get their H1B and that would be a attracting stuff for students as well. Suppose there is no STEM extension then there would be only one chance for the students to get H1B and that might affect the students decision to choose the country of their study. They pay a lot of money for studying here and if they don't get a chance to stay here then they would surely consider other options. That might have a significant effect on Economy as a whole as well.

To conclude, I would say Students come here with an ambition to experience diversity of US and they must be allowed to do so. I strongly support the rule.

Thanks.
