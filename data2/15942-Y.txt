I'm an American engineering graduate student at a major research university, and I know how capable my international colleagues are. Half of all advanced STEM degrees in the United States are now earned by international students. This isn't because international students are taking the spots of American students, its because there simply aren't enough American students interested in pursuing these degrees nowadays. I was one of the few students who chose to continue their education after my undergraduate degree. My undergraduate class was ~90% American students, and now my graduate class is probably less than 50% American students. My university tried hard to get students to stick around, but few would.

Our universities are among the best in the world in part because we attract the best students. Research universities provide tremendous benefits to the economy as a whole, they are much more than just places for students to earn degrees. However, without the students our current system is not sustainable. While the OPT is not the reason most international students choose to study here it is a benefit. Limiting the OPT would harm our universities.

Beyond the benefits to universities the OPT provides high quality workers, even if for a limited time, to industry. This is not about providing a cheap source a labor. There are safeguards to prevent this, and if cheaper labor was the goal the job would be exported overseas. Our country leads the world in technology and innovation, but not allowing some of the best students from our universities to stay and work is an easy way to endanger that position. Brain drain is a real thing. 

The STEM OPT extension absolutely needs to be re-implemented, and beyond that we need to rethink how we handle visas for highly skilled workers. A protectionist policy is misguided and will only work against our status as an technological leader.
