Zhimin Tang I do support the extension. First, United States is country that has a spirit for chasing freedom. The extension doesn't violate this spirit but well manifest and encourage young people to chase the American Dream. Second, it is beneficial for the American economy. On the one hand, the international students from different cultural background will bring much innovative ideas and power to the development for industries related to STEM. On the other hand, it is undoubted that competition exists anytime. The international blood will contributes to the diversity of the competition and gaurantees that the American companies have sufficient employees supply, Third, the extension shows the priority the American gives to the education. It ensures that the new graduated students have opportunity to pratice what they learn in the university.
