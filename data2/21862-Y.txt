I totally support this revision. As a data analyst in an engineering school, I see how international students promote the diversity of engineering discipline, and how difficult they are in getting jobs after graduation. Foreign graduates are already facing lots of barriers and restrictions in job seeking as compared to native graduates. It's never the right way to place excessive restrictions on others so as to 'protect' native workers. To be more competitive, one has to work hard and study hard to promote him/herself. The revision of regulation will do good to the economy and enrich the gene pool in the near future.
