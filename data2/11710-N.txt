Why aren't the likes of facebook and other high tech companies going out and offering to train U.S. citizens to do these jobs instead of selling them out and lowering the prevailing wages of these jobs by bringing in cheaper, overseas labor? Shouldn't the U.S. public have the right to know why they are being tossed aside without a second glance while many will even have to train their immigrant replacements before being let go by the likes of Disney/ABC!

Please contact me and explain why these U.S. jobs are not going to U.S. citizens who elect the very politicians that are supposed to put the interests of the United States citizens first.

Sincerely upset by this nonsense,
