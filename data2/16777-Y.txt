I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. America is a nation where the most talented people all over the world who want to come. To keep the leading role of US in the global competition, we want to keep all the talented people stay in the states. 
In order to get them coming and stay in the states, we should provide them with environment for working hard and stable. Can you imagine how miserable when a talented people decide to leave US only because there are no more H1B for them? 
Moreover, all the talented people are human beings. So they need friends and potential girlfriends/boyfriends especially. The way to support them to stay to to keep their friends and also the potential girlfriend and boyfriend to stay. Therefore we need more OPT time to get h1b for all of them.

2. The Chinese government has offered REALLY GOOD stipend and startup funding for those talented people who want to go back to China. As I know, 5 out of 10 of my friends who graduated last year from the Top engineering university in the state went back to China or go to Singapore, which gives much better visa condition. Wake up America, if you keep preventing the talented students staying in the States. We will be really disappointed. 

3. The diversity of workforce will also enhance the competitance of US company in a globalized market. We do business with Asia and Europe. So we need people from these countries to win the war.If the competitiance has gone, even all the STEM jobs goes to the US citizen, we will still losing our jobs to China, Japan, India, Korea. At the end, more US citizens with STEM major will have no jobs.
