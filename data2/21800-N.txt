I strongly oppose the Dept. of Homeland Securities proposal to increase and expand the Optional Practical Training Program (OPT). The Center for Immigration studies under a FOIA request learned under this program some 497,000 work authorizations were granted through OPT from 2009-2015, thus depriving this same number of Americans the same opportunity. Of particular concern to me is that both the foreign workers and their employers are EXEMPT from payroll taxes, costing social security and medicare some 4 billion during this same period. Also, employers are NOT required to pay the foreigners a prevailing wage, and being in the OPT program gives these workers a bridge to the H1-B tech worker VISA, which also deprives recent American STEM students of jobs. What this is really about is providing companies the means to hire cheap foreign labor at the expense of American workers and STEM students. This is anti-American and should be stopped!
