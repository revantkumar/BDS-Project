Michael Bellemore This illegal executive action by the Obama administration must be stoped. There should be no amnesty granted to those that break our laws, and illegaly enter this country. American citizens should come befor "illegal aliens". Legislation should be drawn up to make it a criminal act to hire, aid, or in any way give "sanctuary" to any and all persons illegaly residing within our borders.
