Wenxi Li I am here to support this rule. A longer period of OPT is defintely a good reason for international students to come to America for study. THIs will then bring profits and subsequently create jobs in Education institutes and business such as book selling, vehicle selling, resterants, etc. This will also increase the diversity in academic and industry.
