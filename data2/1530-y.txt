Lillian M I strongly support this proposal for the reasons below:
1.United States is always being an immigration country which means being open to all the brilliant and creative talents all around the world. This proposal can definitely attract more talents to come here and settle down here to become new Americans and make contributions to the economic and scientific developments of US.
2.The employers in US are in strong needs of the fresh graduates, especially these with background of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. To keep the talents they need, the companies spent lots of money and time on hiring and training the international students. If the employees have to leave the companies due to the visa problems, it would be a considerable loss for the employers.
