It is a sad day in America when taxpayer paid Federal Government employees do NOT support, encourage and demand that United States citizens educated in our own country should be a REQUIRED FIRST CHOICE for employment opportunities.

American taxpayers should require to see the employee's personnel files of ANY STAFF person who suggests anything other than "A qualified United States citizen must be your first choice in employment selection with verifiable reasons for NOT hiring Americans First!"
