Increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years is ridiculous!
You may as well just sign over our country to whomever has the most interest. I work in IT and know plenty of educated, very good IT engineers who are STILL unemployed or underemployed because of the flood of foreign workers taking over our jobs. Make no mistake, once they are here, they hire more of their kind too - discrimination...Remember this work from the 60s and 70s and how we were denied jobs then too, because African Americans test scores were given sometimes a 30 point advantage? Sadly, I find myself telling young people not to pursue IT in college because of the uncertainty in job security.

If this is approved, then you are not listening to the real people in this country! Start thinking about our well-being for a change..no wonder people like listening to Donald Trump rant and rave....they are sick and tired of things like this...over and over again.
