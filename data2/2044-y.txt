Samuel Robison Agree 100% to this rule.

With this rule, more international students are willing to come to study in the U.S. I think one of the reasons that US. is powerful is because it's willing to embrace brains and talents regardless of race, sex, region, etc. I believe without the OPT rule, fewer talented people will come to the U.S. 

International students contribute greatly to US economy. I don't understand why some anti-immigration people state that this rule is wasting tax-payers money.

We pay more tuitions, we buy luxury stuff, we rent apartments, and we shop Apple products - sim free phones - because we have families and friends and we often shop online/instore, and greatly helped U.S financial growth.

Please make this rule live.
