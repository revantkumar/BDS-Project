Renjie Weng The Expanding OPT with STEM degrees is not only benefit to the U.S.A, as well as make good impact on the global environment.

The importance of the high educated people to the prosperity of one area is same as that of the blood to the body. Especially since the Industrial Revolution, talents contributed in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math are the critical power of the economy and development.

Most of those educated people can make more contributed in the U.S. than in any other area in this earth because U.S. is the first one and currently the only one place which lead the technology and science development (Because U.S. has a well developed environment and carefully designed policy to ensure this happen). On the other hand, the U.S. requires more educated people to study and work in the STEM field.

The other point I support the Expanding of OPT is: It is also critical for U.S.'s national benefit. The escaping of high educated people have negative impact on the economy of a county. For example, we do not know which country the next Einstein, Planck, or Turing will be born in, but U.S. can keep its leadership to be attractive enough for those talents. It is possible without Turing, someone else might invent the Turing Machine Theory. However, without the poll of high educated people from all over the world, U.S. would have not been the best place where Intel, Microsoft, or Google been found at.

In short, I support the Expanding of OPT for both the benefit of global economy, as well as to the U.S.
