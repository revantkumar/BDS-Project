Sooraj Radhakrishnan In order to be the leading economic power in the world, US has to be at the fore front of scientific and technological research, innovation and entrepreneurship. While US universities attract some of the best students from across the world every year, the OPT program and the current proposed extension makes it possible for them and their acquired skills to contribute to the US economy and the scientific and technological advancement. As far the students are concerned, it gives them the opportunity to collaborate with leading minds in their respective fields and enrich their career experience. I record my strong support for the proposed 24-month OPT extension and CapGap relief for all eligible F-1 students.
