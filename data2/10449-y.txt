Ruize Lu I strongly support this proposal since this is a double win for both United State and international student. And I don't think this will affect US citizens. Since we all know there are huge requirement for positions of IT, technology and science company. Extension of the OPT will help those companies to find a lot of talent people to work for them and make technology moving forwards faster. While there's no this extension, this gonna be a huge loss for the development of the technology even the society.
