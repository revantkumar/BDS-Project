This cannot continue to happen. People who have worked hard and earned degrees in these fields and are already employed should not be casualties of a failed administrations action.These people have families to support and I'm sure some of them even voted for the current administration to keep them in office. Why is it that a country that wants people to buy everything yet at every turn looks to lessen to workforce more and more? Is there a jobs program in other countries that allows American workers the opportunity to advance their lives while taking work away from native countrymen?
