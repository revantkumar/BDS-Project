I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.. They can achieve their American dream and make full use of their knowledge to realize more things in U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, many talented Chinese graduated student choose to stay U.S. to accept the offer of local company, which will graetly increase the diversity of these companies and help them to be more competitive in global competition.
