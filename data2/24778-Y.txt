I strongly support this proposal because it is beneficial for both the F-1 student and the U.S. society.

1) Eligible F-1 students are often hired by local high-tech companies for reasons. These students have gained professional training inside and/or outside of the U.S. They are highly qualified for those job which need a lot of well-educated students to handle. F-1 students who just graduate have the freshest knowledge and great motivations to work in the field they are good at. Losing these students is like losing a great deal of high-tech contribution, and give them away to other countries.

2) Culture diversity is the major characteristic of America. The F-1 students not only contribute to the high-tech industries, bringing international insights; but also bringing their own overseas cultures in states, bringing more vibrant atmosphere to American society.

3) OPT extension allows F-1 students to fit in American companies, giving the high-tech industries most contribution. This mechanism ensures the most suitable employees to work in American high-tech industries. And those who cannot fit in will leave at the end of the OPT extension period. Such OPT extension not only ensures the contribution that these F-1 students can devote to American society during the OPT extension, but also ensures that the most suitable persons to stay after the OPT extension. It is for the best.
