i strongly support the proposed rule however i am concerned with the extra administrative burdens placed on employers through the Mentorship Training Program that may potentially deter employment of F-1 STEM students. While a formal mentoring plan is applaudable, the strict attestment requirement from employers may have serious negative effect on hiring STEM students, especially by small companies that lack legal and administrative resources.
