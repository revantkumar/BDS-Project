The efforts of this administration to work around Congress on important legislative measures has to be stopped. This game of stopping all legislation in the Senate by Harry Reid, and delegating authority via departmental regulations is unconstitutional and it has gone far enough. I will never vote for a Democrat or any other politician whose goal is to pursue an agenda that hurts the common people of this nation, so you know why I am against this law by regulation scheme this administration has been using. Electing Democrats to high office was a big mistake and this will be corrected in the coming election cycle. 

No more Obama administrations - and no more anti constitutional politicians. This is not the America my father fought a war to defend, it is a sham and it has to stop. 

I do not want to see any more of citizen rights given to foreign persons, those jobs can go to Americans, and it is a lie from big business that they can't find enough qualified Americans to fill these jobs. They just want to go on the cheap by giving jobs to people who will work for half wages and no benefits, while our people suffer unemployment and go bankrupt. The real bankruptcy here is the moral one that drives the cynical thinking and motivation for regulations like this one.
