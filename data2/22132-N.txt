Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a very good plan. A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed several desiring facts about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand. Two of them are:

OPT actually creates American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT provides $4 billion for the Social Security and Medicare trust funds from international students.

The proposed regulations are "responsible and necessary considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was vital to promote U.S. economic development, and that the Department was adequately overseeing it."

The report also provides a important supporting fact regarding a major national security issue in that tens of thousands of foreign students are well-educated, they will promote the education level and the safety of our community. The GAO said that 'OPT provides United States with many talents and skilled foreign people who apply their valuable experience and knowledge to our nation, making the United States the leading role in the world.'

This rule must go into efffect.

Thank you,
