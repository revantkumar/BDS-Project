james bobek Dear Sirs:
I strongly oppose Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Operational Training Program. 
This will only harm American workers both employed and un or underemployed. You will stop this program and
or retract any planned expansions that depresses wages for the American worker. - thank You for your attention in this matter
