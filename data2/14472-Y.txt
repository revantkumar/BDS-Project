I think that 12 months regular with 24 months more extension time is a good and necessary length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at Google, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion. So the project will be influenced badly.
