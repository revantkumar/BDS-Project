I personally agree to extend the OPT STEM program.

There might be some misunderstanding about this program, because some people think all foreign students can apply for this extension. In fact, only talented STEM students who work for e-verified companies can apply for that.

Some people complain that it's hard to find a job because there are so many OPT students. That's not true. Competitions exist everywhere. In this technology driven era, if you don't work hard, you cannot find a good job. I agree that talented people have made it harder for ordinary people to find a job. Because companies need brains and talents to help generate more revenues. This program helps companies to pick only the most qualified candidates. in this way, companies and organizations can thrive, and eventually contribute to the greater good. If it's too easy to find a job, if everyone knows that there will be know competition and that they can easily find jobs as long as they have citizenship, they will not work so hard, because they don't have competitors. So some US. STEM workers are merely too selfish.

OPT students are legal tax-payers, they contribute to US. economy. Not only because their ability to consume, but also, they help companies to thrive, to grow bigger and be profitable.

100% agree on the new program.
