Peng Wu How can a student be in OPT?
1. They have to be better than most of students in their home countries to be able to study abroad.
2. They have to be better than most of job candidates to be able to find a job within 3 months. Those who can't be are already forced back to their home countries.
3. Some of them have already been trained on their positions for about 1 year.
They are most productive labors. They are here to build this country. I don't understand why force them back for any speakable/unspeakable reasons.
