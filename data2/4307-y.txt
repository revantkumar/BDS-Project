Elsie Connelly I object to the.administrations overreach. Enabling foreign students extended visas is just another way for Obama and his cronies to turn the United States into a 3rd world country.

If they cannot finish their course of studies in the allotted time, that means that they are not here to further their education.

It is just another way for them to bypass the legal requirements for legalized citizenship. Of particular concern are the unwarranted intrusion into our freedoms of speech.
