I fully support it. OPT for international students and the extension of OPT for STEM majors would both benefit the students and the US. 

As for the students, they can obtain very useful post-graduation trainings and experiences in a US working environment with great companies and research institutes. The education and the short working experience they received in the US would benefit their life and career greatly wherever they go in the future and promotes the spreading of US influence worldwide. 

For the US, the education and working opportunities under OPT attracts talented students across the world, which ensures the US to keep leading the world in science and technology. As a result, more job opportunities will be created instead of being occupied. If the next Google or Apple is founded in somewhere else other than the US due to its less attraction to talented students, it will be a huge loss of job opportunities for the US people.
