Alexsander Apostolov I SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
First of all, there is no doubt that international students are playing more and more important roles in our country's high-tech developments. Almost all the IT companies such as Google, Facebook, Uber and etc. are now hiring a great number of international students especially the stem students. In other words, they are becoming the pivotal manpower in American economic now. I can't imagine what will happen if the government drive them out of the country right now.

Moreover, I think the idea of stopping the proposal is surly a kind of retrograding. Instead, the key point is how to improve the proposal and make sure it will not be abused. For example, we can make the rules apply only for students from the top 50 universities in the U.S., or we can regulate the rules to make sure that H1b lottery is fair and nobody can cheat in it. 

So as a U.S. citizen, I strongly support the new law and hope that the other people can think and speak rationally. That is one basic principle of being a U.S. citizen.
