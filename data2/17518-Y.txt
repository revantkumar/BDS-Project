I am supporting this doc with all my mind.

1. The reason why the U.S. keeps being the most powerful and competitive country in the world is because it tries to absorb talented people from all different places. No matter where u are coming from, as u work hard, u will earn your own new life. This is "American dreams" all about. From the first nuclear weapon to the great social network, a large amount of cutting-edge tech are supported by students and professor from different countries. From engineering perspective, this is much more obvious.

2. Large amounts of STEM students had become permanent residents and even citizen to serve the land with their dreams. Part of them make their own business, which is a way to create more jobs for local residents, not to mention the tax they contribute to federal and local government.

Highly support this rule to pass.
