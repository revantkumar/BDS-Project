MM93 Danni Chen I firmly support this regulation for the following reasons:

1. Freedom and equality is the basic rights for human beings and in the US, absolutely including the equal rights of working opportunities among all ethics.
2. Foreign students have been trained and educated through the US college systems with professional technical skills and knowledge. They are smart and talented people, they can contribute to the development of the technical field, and they all went through the legal and formal recruitment system when they get access to the the US job market. I don't see any reason why they should be restricted for the the equal working opportunity. 
3. The foreign students have contributed a lot to the US education system in terms of the education investment. If they are treated unequally, the future students will not choose US for high level education, which will be have bad impact to the US economy.
4. The IT industry work load now has a lot of foreign students. If the rule are banned, a lot of the students will have to go back to homeland, and this will cost a lot for these US company to recruitment, and induce a unstable working market. Obviously, this will be a bad news to those company. 

Overall, considering the US economy and international politics, the 24 months extension rule should be passed.
