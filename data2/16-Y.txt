I somehow gloat over you Americans, when you spare no efforts to facilitate the cancellation of the OPT extension and at the same time feel greatly proud of it, because in your eyes, this brings about the possibility of higher wages and more working posts for a citizens.

Let me tell you some facts that you should know. In STEM, people from China and India takes a large portion. Each year, China loses a huge amount of highly qualified manpower resources. The intellectual students in the top universities of China, who have passed countless horrifying peer competitions to succeed, are seeking to continue their study in those famous universities in the U.S., and many of them would like to find a job after graduation in the U.S. Sometimes, I really worry about the situation that China has exported too many excellent students and workers to the U.S., contributing to the development of your country, not mine. 

Yes, I admit, if there are less people compete for a post, the wages could increase. But think for a while, what those international companies would do to cut the cost? I believe they would choose to move to a country with abundant and highly-qualified workers. You may recall how U.S. loses the manufacturing industry by the high cost. It could be anticipated that, in the near future, U.S. will become less and less attractive to the STEM workers. Maybe one day, companies like Apple and Microsoft would like to move most of their R&D centers to China or India. This is what I really hope to see, as a patriot from China.

Cancel the extension, please, if you would like to send back those qualified workers. You may even cancel OPT and CPT, if you are really willing to lose the leadership in STEM subjects. Good luck to you Americans!
