As a result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, many talented young people were forced to leave their country and take refuge in Syria.
Through Iraqi Student Project, my husband and I had occasion to assist many of them in their quest for advanced schooling
in the United States. They have all made us proud. All of them faced enormous difficulties once they graduated in securing 
continued legal status in the U.S. 

Now students from Syria are similarly challenged. It is my hope that our nation will handle these young people more hospitably.
