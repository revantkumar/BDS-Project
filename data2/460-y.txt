Shuangshuang Li As a software designer at IBM and a former foreign student studied at Carnegie Mellon University, I strongly support proposal. Myself, along with hundred of thousands of foreign professionals, are making our contributions to U.S. tech companies, which is an important role for the entire high-tech industries in US. This rule will ensure more talented and hard working international students coming to U.S. to study and work afterwards. U.S. should open its door to smart souls and make it the greatest country with greatest minds
