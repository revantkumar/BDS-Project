I strongly support the OPT Extension, which I believe is a very good policy for American economy. As we all know, immigrants with educational background in STEM fields have contributed tremendously to America's economy, especially in areas like information technology, natural science, engineering, or finance, immigrants are a major driving force for the growth of these fields. If the OPT extension does not exist any more, American companies will lose many talented foreign employees who will make great contributions to the community, America will lose a lot of energy in STEM fields since developments in these fields are greatly driven by F-1 students with STEM degrees. In conclusion, the OPT extension is a very good rule for America, it gives many talented foreign students in STEM fields the chances to make contributions in America and ensures American's sustainable vitality and progress in science and technology fields.
