Michael Torr Please do not ignore this comment I am making. In Chinese community, they are asking people to submit multiple comments to say supporting OPT extension. I just translate a few sentences using Google translate:

*****
Chinese navy in the world should be invincible! ! !
Suggest that you change the name to submit a few more
*****

My thoughts:
If US government is going to allow these people stay longer, who knows what they will do to this country. What I interpret from this website is, they are cheaters, they are thinking they are Number 1 in the world, as in a form of Chinese army.

Please see what I found from this website:

OPT!
