Charles Lee I strongly agree that we should give a long OPT extension to the foreign students, in some special situation, we should give H1B or green card directly to them for our country's benefits. We provide the best education in the world. We train these STEM students to be the best employees for lots of areas, especially IT area. As far as I know, most of the biggest companies in US hire OPT students, and these students have become the strongest power in their engineer teams. Might I ask why we want to quit them and send them back to their countries? I cannot imagine such well-educational people make their best contribution to some countries other than ours, US. For our benefits, we must give them opportunities to make these contribution. It will hurt our country if we say no to them, as our economy and all other industries depend on these smart brains. In a word, please make sure to give them opportunities and benefit our country best.

Thanks.
