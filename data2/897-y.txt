Authur Leyton Please pay attention. Students under OPT are legal with a valid F-1 visa. They have paid their tuition, and all living expense. If they are illegal, that is definitely a seriously problem, but then they are not able to get an OPT. Please leave a comment after figuring out what is going on.
