YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension.

Firstly, for many years, foreign tech workers contributed marvelous growth to the USA economy. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.

In addition, when I watched American television shows, it always talked about American dreams. I've seen so many foreigners said they have an American dream and they work so hard to fulfill it. USA always claim itself as the equal and fair country in the world, which give so many people in the world the courage to chase their dream. And OPT-extension is the great reflection of this spirit, as an international student, I've seen so many other students who have the greatest passion for their American dream. APPROVE the OPT-extension, not only for nonimmigrant students, but also for the USA.
