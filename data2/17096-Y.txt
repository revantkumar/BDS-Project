I strongly agree with this new proposal for three main reasons:

1) Foreign students have great pressure in finding jobs and staying in the U.S. with limited OPT time. This extension will help more students in STEM program finding jobs in the U.S. No one can denny the fact that lots of brilliant foreign students have contributed to the fast development of America.

2) This extension is not conflict with local Americans. American people still find jobs much easier than foreigners. My American classmate can easily find a job in Amazon while a foreign student with the same level of knowledge may take months to find a not too bad job. It has already been so tough for foreign students. Why not give us more opportunities to pursue our dreams in the U.S.?

3) Americans pursue fairness and freedom. It is unfair to block foreigners outside U.S. It is also unwise to block brilliant foreigners outside the U.S. 

In a word, the new proposal will benefit both Americans and foreigners in long term.
