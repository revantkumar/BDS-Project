Tiger Han May I ask why so many negative response to this proposal?

1. America is built by the immigration and freedom of striving for better life.
2. The inequality is not due to the immigration but the unseen segregation (gender, race, age) in minds.(I hate to say that but it is true)
3. Excluding high qualified potential citizens is a better choice for U.S. Immigration policy in future? No one can buy it.
4. Don't let junky comments faked by those anti-immigrate associations blind your eyes.
5. Don't be coward, my fella!
