Brian Nelson I totally support the STEM OPT Extension, the policy will definitely bring lots of benefits for the U.S. economic development. According to the chapter 16 of "Handbook of Trade Policy for Development" by Dr. Francisco Rivera-Batiz, Professor of Economics and Education and Professor of International and Public Affairs from Columbia University, immigrants have relatively little competition with natives. In some cases, (especially for the case of STEM fields), immigrants may in fact be complementary with natives, raising the natives' wages and employment opportunities. Employers that utilize immigrants may not survive international competition without the availability of the migrants and both their income as well as the earnings of the natives they employ is positively effected by immigration. 

In addition, the policy will increase the labor force proportion, which will become a demographic gift for the U.S. economic development. With higher level of labor force rate, the dependency rate will decrease. The increased labor force will also lead to a higher level of savings, which will become a large amount of resource for investment, which is a significant factor for economic development. The tax paid by the foreign students will become revenue for the country. Since those foreign students are not citizens, they could not share any U.S. welfare benefits. All of their tax will become resources for the natives in the U.S. As a result, those students are LITERALLY HELPING THE AMERICANS TO REDUCE THEIR BURDEN. Their tax help to pay the Social Security for the elderly in the U.S. Then government will have left money for investment. This is definitely a good policy!
