I am strongly against this. There are low paid and millions unemployed U S citizens. I think training the unemployed with better jobs will get them to work. Why not give the training to the legal citizens first. Rewarding bad behavior has NEVER been a good thing. What if all legal citizens ran red lights, they are breaking the law,they get punished if caught. Illegals NEED to learn in this country there is a right way and wrong way to do something, if you do something wrong there is a consequence. There are millions here in the US who choose to go through the system and do the paperwork,get a job. What does helping ILLEGAL UNDOCUMENTED people say to those who came here the right way and through the proper channels? That's a slap in the face to them, and our own natural citizens.
