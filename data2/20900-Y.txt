OPT program is crucial to not only the foreign talented students but all the citizens living in this country. I'm really really shame on those disgusting comments that showing bias and prejudices on international students who are devoted to the improvement of US economics. THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR COUNTRY!
I'm working in a IT consulting company that founded by my boss, a Chinese immigrants who came to LA holding a F1 visa ten years ago. I lost my previous job during the f*king 2008 crisis. It's hard to imagine my situation now without the help from him. OPT program is not a low wage allegation, those students coming from other countries are being paid the highest annual salary 'cause they are more skillful than native Americans. The competition is equal and if you want to seek for a suitable job, just gain more knowledge and learn more skills!
