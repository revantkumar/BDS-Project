I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. There's many advantage for capable STEM students working in US. First, they're mostly working in technology field and DON'T have anything to do with minimum wage. They need to receive a salary higher than the minimum wage to get a valid visa. And they're paying taxes to help enhance society welfare. Many international students work in big and competitive international companies such as Google and Facebook. They're in fact enhance US's advantage in international competition. And to some objective commenters: foreign students are BY NO MEANS endangering social security. They're programmers and engineers. Silicon Valley has thousands graduated foreign students, and we can all see it's becoming better and now is non-controversal No.1 IT center not only in US, but also in the world.
