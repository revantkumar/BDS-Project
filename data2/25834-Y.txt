I am so surprised to see there are so many objections to the STEM extensions. Throughout the history of the US, talent foreigners have significant contributions to the development of the country. Anyone who is eligible to the STEM extension program might be the next one to change the country. Without such a program, he/she might leave the US due to the current stupid immigration system. You are more than welcome to stop the STEM extension program if you want to screw up the country.
