The extension of OPT is beneficial for the US economy, science, and technology development. Research shows that international students comprise more than 50% of the STEM advanced degree in American colleges and Universities. Nevertheless, most of them will leave the US after their graduation. With the extension of OPT, the international graduates with STEM degrees would be allowed to use their talents and skills working for the US companies, organizations, or research institutes, which gives the US advantage to compete with other countries.
