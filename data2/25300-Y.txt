I would strongly support this rule. 
Opportunities are made for the people who work hard. No matter where you from, what race you are. We all created to the equal. As you work hard for yourself and the society you should able to benefit from the society as well. American is a great country because it treat you as how you respect it. 
Hard work should lead to a good feed back. Not less opportunities. 
Good luck Amrincan, good luck peoples. God bless you all. 

Thank you.
