Expanding OPT for STEM international students will do exactly no harm for citizens. I really don't understand why any American would say no to that. For the employers, they only care about hiring qualified students without paying more. Therefore the huge amount of internationally students who perform better than their American peers and don't require the H1B visa to work legally will be absolutely the best choice for the companies. And for American job seekers, it is totally wrong if you think the OPT students will take your position. Because if the employers don't apply the H1B visa for them, they can only do the job for less than 3 years, which means they are disposable, like interns. Do you want to find a job that treat you as disposable? I don't think so. And if the employers would like to pay the extra money to apply H1B for them rather than hiring you with no extra cost, it only means they won't hire you even without the international competitors. Just that simple and clear.
