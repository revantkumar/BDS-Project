I support the 24-month extension of OPT for the benefit of the stability and development of the US society. The US job market is in an increasing demand of the students with STEM degrees, and a great number of students with STEM degrees are international students. By giving international students enough time to apply H1B visa gives US employer enough time to find a good fit for the professional position after examining the performance of the students on OPT. Any sudden change in the OPT regulation can lead to a shortage and other problems in the labor market.
