I strongly support the new 24 month extension of OPT STEM mainly due to the following reasons:
1) STEM students bring value to American companies. Most STEM students work in science, mathematics and technology. They have brought huge profit to many US companies such as Google and Apple which are the cores of US economy. The current H1b policy has already driven a lot of people away when the candidates lose the lottery. The companies will lose more talented people without OPT STEM.
2) Many universities offer degrees (especially graduate schools) that offer OPT STEM options. As far as I know, one of the reasons that many foreign students apply for these programs is because the OPT STEM. If the STEM is canceled, it is very likely that students will choose similar programs in countries like UK where the work visa is easier. As a results, the programs are likely to lose a huge amount of intuition which are usually only affordable to foreign students. 
3) US is a immigration country. Like it or not, US benefits from most immigrants. At the same time, US has a solid law foundation that ensure the country can benefit from immigrants. This way, US immigrants brings population to the country so that it does not age to much and provide competition to make the country's technology is always at frontline. If we compare to other developed countries such as France and Japan, US has a steady growth in economy and technology that no other countries can achieve. The immigration law has helped the economy a lot. If OPT STEM is cancelled, this will bring doubts to the immigration law of the country and its foundations.

Overall, I support the new proposed rule on 24 month extension. I agree that people that abuse the law should be punished, but this is no reason to harm the benefits of many American companies and schools.
