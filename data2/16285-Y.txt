I support this because our higher education industry (yes, it is a industry) is highly dependent on the number of international students who assist the institutions greatly on financial issues. The most important way to welcome them is to create job opportunities for them. Btw, they are not here to take jobs away from most Americans. Only Stem gets extension, why? Because there isn't enough qualified American students in those fields.
