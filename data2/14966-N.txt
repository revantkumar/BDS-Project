It is disgraceful to provide incentive for American companies like Disney to hire foreign workers and pay them less money than their own American workers and force the American workers out of their jobs. These incentives should be stopped on the basis of plain decency and preferring Americans for American jobs. Optional Practical Training is displacing American workers and should be stopped or changed to insist foreign workers return to their home countries without taking American jobs.
