Cody Zhang I strongly support the proposal because as an international student in US, I learned knowledge from U.S. university and hope to contribute to the country. Obviously, the knowledge would be better applied to where it is from. Additionally, hiring international students smooths and speeds up trade among countries without cultural conflicts and misunderstandings.
