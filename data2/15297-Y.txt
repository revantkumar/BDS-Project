I strongly support the extension of OPT for following reasons :

1.Since high tech industry is so essential for US to remain competitive among countries, high tech companies in United States need more qualified work force with rare skill set to compete with emerging high tech companies around the world,

2.United States spend huge amount of resource on public Higher Education organizations like universities and colleges. it doesn't make sense for students from foreign countries not to contribute to US economy after they graduate. ( especially students with engineering talents )
