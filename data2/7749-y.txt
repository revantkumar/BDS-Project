Ryan Gu I'm definitely in favor of this new regulation.

Just think of those international students who start their own business here in the States. They create thousands of new jobs each year and by no means are they squeezing out those native students. Studying abroad is a very competitive process elsewhere in the world so only the very best got the chance to come to the US. I cannot think of any situation where those international students getting the minimum pay and doing works that are not related to their field of study.

Nowadays we always emphasize openness and diversity, and by incorporating international students we can achieve this goal with depth, in the sense that the students are the most lively group in the communication of different cultures. It is definitely helpful for the over prosperity of the United States.
