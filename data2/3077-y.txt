Ziyang Zhang First of all, I strongly support the expansion of OPT to STEM students. I am a small business owner and an international STEM student. My company is helping people to better understand human vision. I founded the company during my masters study in US and currently, my small startup has created 5 job positions, 2 of my employees are US citizens. My OPT will expire on 08/2016. I am worried what to do when it expires. I am planning to move my company back to China. 

US is a great place for entrepreneurship. And expansion of OPT will definitely help more young international entrepreneurs to create more job positions for US and advance US's technology.
