Totally agree with this excellent proposal. America is a migration country and the highly educated foreigners who want to stay and work here deserve better policies to guarantee their rights and help them live securely. I personally think the approval of this proposal will significantly increase the economy of United States because it will ensure more jobs filled and help to stabilize the society. STEM students are young and well trained to help build up the states. Support! Support! Support!
