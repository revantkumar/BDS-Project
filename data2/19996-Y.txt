OPT expansion is definitely necessary, especially for those F1 students. 
1) International student come to US, not only study knowledge, but also contribute to the US society during their pursuing the degrees. This OPT expansion would keep making contributions to the U.S. 

2) Some arguments say that International student will replace the local US citizens with even lower pay. That is NOT correct. As we all know, competition is very important to US, and this is also the reason why the US is the top one country in the world. We can not avoid this competition, by this local protection. This would finally harm the US in long term.
