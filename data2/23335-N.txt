We as Americans have always been there for every other nation in the world. I believe it is time to take care of our own not just in getting rid of this & all student aid programs for illegals as well foriegn students on visas. Those on Visas can & should be sponsered by thier own government not ours. We have many students leaving college with no work we need to give the American citizens opportunity to these jobs first.
