I strongly agree with the 24-month OPT extension since I see the benefits for both the employer and the students. As a students who receives 12 months opt plus 24 months extension would be more competitive after they finished their degree into the career, comparing to a 1 year entry level experience. It could also bring benefits for schools and housing's development due to the amount of incoming new international students. On the other hands, employer could have a longer contract with students who they think would be a good asset of their teams. They do not need to seeking for a newly graduated students with no experience in the industry to do the job. With all these supportive ideas, I think the extension would be a great benefit for both students and employers.
