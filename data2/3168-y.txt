Siva Sarath Chandra Inapuri It's a win win situation with 24 month OPT extension. As a management consultant , I can see the amount of benefit organizations amass from the international students. Implementing this rule will benefit international student community to get more exposure on real time application of the knowledge they gained from college. At the same time, it is beneficial for united states to retain and attract the international brain power. Lets not forget that USA currently is benefiting more from foreign born students when compared to other nations and lets keep it that way for the sake of the great country. 

I strongly support and urge the rule to be brought in , for the benefit of the United states and the international students.
