What! Are you kidding me? Giving jobs away to -=Americans! We might as well move ourselves back to where the non-Americams came from. It used to be a privilege to be an American. With all the government assistance to Non-Americansit is more like a curse! If someone comes here illegally, they get all the benefits American citizens are entitled to. If non-Americans go to school in America, legally or illegally, they are given hiring preference over Americans. If Non-Americans come to America and start a business, they are given tax incentives and pay no federal income taxes for several years. If an American wants to start a new business they must pay enough taxes to cover their own taxes plus the taxes of the non-Americans that are not paying taxes!

What a boat load of dung this is. It is high time We The People toss out all of these career politicians that are giving our rights and privileges away to non-Americans and take our country back.

The career politicians can go to Mexico and Taiwan and apply for a job! Good Luck.
