i vote for the opt extension policy! International students need to be treated better because they are the well-educated and capable people who can contribute a lot to the US. I dont think people who need opt extension will compete with the US citizen a lot because they are in a totally different pool. The jobs they are seeking are most in IT company and tech company. They will not take the job opportunity from most us citizens.
