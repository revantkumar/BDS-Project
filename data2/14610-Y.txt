I am the owner of a technology business and the graduate of an elite technical university. In graduate school, my class was 60% international students. In the technology industry, it has become staggeringly expensive to employ engineers. CapGap relief for STEM/eligible F-1 Students just makes sense. These students want to be in the US to learn from some of the best universities in the world, and they want to stay to help build some of the most valuable companies in the world. 

Not allowing students to stay is effectively a state-sponsored brain drain, and everyone is worse off because of it.
