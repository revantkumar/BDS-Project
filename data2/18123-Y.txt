I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1.The development of the IT industry cannot be impeded by the nationality. There is no doubt that IT industry is important for America. Giving more chance for foreign students to work in America will absolutely be beneficial to the whole IT industry for America. For instance, I major in Software Enginnering whose students resource are always from the China and India. Both of us devote ourselves into learning, beyond doubt, we gain so much knowledge about the Software Engineering that is the key factor the IT field. All of us could contribute so much to the development of the American economy and even the IT industry.

2.It is the American spirit that emphasize the equality. Therefore, equal chances should be provided for both native students and foreign students. What's more, American students seldom choose some particular job such as coder as their job. So, there does not exist the competition between American students and foreign students in these specific areas.

3.The rule is beneficial to American education since it can attract more foreign students. Those students who could go to America for further study are talented and great.
