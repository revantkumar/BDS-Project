I am not a law maker and I just provide some personal ideas.

I totally agreed modify the OPT STEM extension from 17 months to 24 months.

These years the H1B visa quota always went out during the first week of April. And the applicants have to enter the crude lottery process. Many talented people lost their chance to contribute their talent to American society. And many American companies lost their cool foreign workers just by bad luck. These sudden bad luck would cost American companies more to set up a process to seek the replacement. Julia Preston in New York times just wrote an article about this crude reality today. A talented French young man Tho Ngri, who kept building cool stuff since 13 year old hire by a start-up company in San Francisco. But he lost H1B lottery and he has to leave US immediately. His explorer has to put some extra money on finding his replacement and maybe found or maybe not. The longer OPT STEM extension may mitigate H1B lottery. It may give some of the H1B applicant one more time to enter the lottery next year. Save both talents for American society and money for American companies.
