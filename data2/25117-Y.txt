In my opinion, extend the OPT STEM rule has lots of advantages. Not only F-! non immigrant students will benefit from it, but also the U.S. technology companies. Without this rule, students can only work on year in U.S. for companies which cannot make more profits for companies since lots of companies spend a few months to train the new employees. However, with the new rule, companies can hire an F-1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years which definitely will benefit the production.

What is more, I think American spirit always give everyone equal chance. I hope the U.S. government can give those students a chance to show their ability and boost the U.S. economy in IT area. And also, it is good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study here.
