I strongly SUPPORT this regulation. This would benefit USA economy in a long run. 
1. A big resource supporting Universities is the tuition. Foreigners pay much more than American residents. One of the greatest attraction to those money holder is OPT. If this rule can not get approved, US government will have to find more funding to support universities. Well, expect more tax if this rule is denied. 
2. Most of the OPT holders have high level education. Those label force would serve the high tech industries. Apple needs well trained engineers to make IPHONE and a great potion of them come from OPTers. One of the best way of keeping talented people working here is the OPT. 
3. Just think of what the impact would be if all OPTers just go to there home country. A great amount of companies can not stand! A great sorrow to American economy and possibly another depression. Americans will be even more difficult to find a job. So stop crying US resident cannot find a job. It is NOT because of OPTers. They work hard to help american economy and therefore create more jobs.
4. It is a shame to find out soooo many comments saying that OPTers do not pay tax to USA. They pay the same as US residences. 
5. Now high-tech already starts to move out of the country. What if Asians do not need INTEL chips? No more IPHONEs sold to other country? Joogle starts in Japan and beat Google? what do Americans still have? STOP SENDING VALUABLE LABEL FORCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES!!
5. Great American is the most powerful country in the world because of the multicultural land. The country needs more talents, needs to keep its power.

Can not think of one single reason to go against this rule.
