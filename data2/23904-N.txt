Now I know for sure that our Administration (specifically DHS)is totally against We The People. This OPT program is a farce, just as is the H-1B program. You are robbing We the People of jobs thus getting no taxes from these recipient programs. How do you expect us to provide for our legitimate daily expenses along with loss of Social Security benefits when we have to donate to foreigners (legal or illegal?)to provide them educational benefits that when completed they probably will stay in the USA and profit more sending more monies back to their home countries. I'm sure you are smart enough to figure this out - or not? My question is: What benefits are you receiving? You have to have a reasonable reason to be going after this - it sure isn't for the betterment of our US of A!!!

Isn't this OPT, an added provision to H-1B, a violation of Congressional intent, discrimination, with no American graduates receiving the same benefits? From what I'm reading DHT doesn't even know where thousands of foreign students are living and/or working in our country - bet they will turn up IF this OPT goes through!!!! causing more loss in taxes which should be coming in from legal American citizens.

Why are you not investing monies in our own students to attend community colleges or better yet, get our high schools to provide classroom training, use our STEM program properly? Quit subsidizing these companies that hire these alien college grads rather than an American college grad with the same skills. I can answer these questions: companies are making loads of money in not hiring Americans when they abuse (H-1B) and OPT to hire cheap foreign labor

On and on this goes and there will be/is so much fraud involved in ANY Government project! Let's get THE PEOPLE involved in solving problems and keep Government OUT.

Thank you for your time.
