Victor Kovac The US Federal government needs to start putting American workers first. After all your very existence is predicated in the taxes we have paid into the system. DHS in particular should ONLY be open to US born workers. If you claim to not have enough American STEM workers - a claim that I dispute - then the government which has a near monopoly on public education it the United States obviously needs to change its educational priorities and establish programs designed to create more STEM workers. America has tens of millions of unemployed and underemployed working age people, many who could and should be re-trained to perform STEM job requirements. The American government needs to start putting Americans first. STOP ALL IMMIGRATION NOW. Each new immigrant is taking resources out of the mouth of native born Americans. Immigrants take from the social benefits network like EBT, social security etc much more than they put into the system. American government jobs should be reserved for native born American citizens. It is madness in the midst of a near global depression to allow the government to bring in more foreign workers when tens of millions of Americans are out of work.
