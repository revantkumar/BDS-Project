Stephen Metcalfe Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century.
