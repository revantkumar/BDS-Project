Chengcheng Tan The duration of an extension should be set at 24 months.I came to U.S.instead of other countries for master degree, because of OPT extension which allows me to have greater participation in STEM training. It usually takes a long time as everyone knows.It's really VITAL for so many STEM students here in United States, don't make the extension invalid. If you cancel it, it will break the balance and kill so many dreams.
