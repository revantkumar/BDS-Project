I actively support this new OPT extension rule.
The new rule can help American academic remain its global competitive. The internship opportunity provided by OPT rule is one of the important reason that many international students choose to study America, not many other counties, like Germany, UK
Canada also have a similar program that allow international students work and stay in Canada for a period equal to the length they studied to attract international students. Industrial experience is more attractive than diploma to international students. And they will evaluate the post-education work program in different countries when they choose their study place.
