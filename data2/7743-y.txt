Hu Qin As a foreign STEM student, I really understand what is OPT meaning for us.
That will affect how I realize what is euqal, what is American spirit, which is absolutely not keeping immigration out of US. As a student, we spend much more time than native students to learn not only languages , but also technology and theory to pass millions of test to get the chance studying here.
If we lost the chance to practice our theory and knowledge, maybe the society will lose the chance to get improved. Just like the previous immigration, they changed the world, but the beginning was got a job in US!! 12 months are too short for us to find a job, we need 29 months or more to get the employers know us. 
We need more right to find a job not only we are smarter but also we paid more TUITION!!!
