Teresa Qiu I strongly SUPPORT this proposal due to following reasons:

Every year, millions of F1 student came to the universities in US with self sponsorship and their tuition is one of the importance financial source to the schools. Those money was well spend on the development of both academic and research abilities for those Universities and thus benefit a lot in enhancing the overall compatibility of University in US against other universities around the world. F1 student take the OPT and OPT extension as a benefit to study in US. If they lose the practical opportunities along with the study, they may choose Universities in Europe/Australia other than US. This may result to US loose most of excellent international students who may potentially benefit to both the research abilities and also their tuitions.
