Nancy Jaye The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program further harms American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. 

I have worked for a tech company for the past five years that exploits every possible means (some not strictly legal) to move jobs from the US to India and move Indians to the US to do jobs for lower pay. They do not need another program to further these efforts to increase their bottoms lines by gutting the American workforce. 

I have watched US natives be laid off or leave in frustration over management policies and be replaced by foreign workers who are unable to do the job as well but will work for less. I have seen the quality of our product and customer satisfaction plummet, even as our profits rose. I have watched other tech companies move in the same direction. This is no longer a field I would want my children to go into.
