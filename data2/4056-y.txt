Michael Brown I strongly disagree your arguments, and DO believe improving and expanding OPT is good for USA!

First of all, no evidence conforms that US has a lot of STEM workers. However, considering economic recovery of USA, I do believe that USA needs more STEM workers to push economy growth. 

Second, there is not evidence show that fortune 500 companies did not tell the truth, and it is also did not make any sense foreign labor will be cheaper, especially in STEM area. However, your first and second arguments do conflict with each other. If USA have enough STEM worker, why fortune 500 companies just hire some one who claim less salary. The fundamental reason that these big companies wants to keep high skilled F1 student to for USA rather than other countries. In other words, it is good for USA.

Based on these two points, I strongly support OPT extension!
