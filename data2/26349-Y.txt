I truly believe that, over the course of our history as a nation of great universities, colleges, graduate schools, private institutes, and so forth, we benefit as a country and as a people, by having so many talented students attending these institutes of higher learning. 
.
There is more than one justification for what I've said, but I will leave my comment length to my #1 outlook in this regard: those students include many from countries unaccustomed to the freedoms that we enjoy in the Unites States of America, whether academic freedom of thought, individual daily freedoms, or the degrees to which many people like myself, come to the aid (if only verbally) of foreign students.
.
Income to universities & area businesses, etc, would be another reason, and I might also include that the USA's own student bodies are enriched by the cultures of other countries. I will leave those 2 added reasons with further discussion, at least for now, because... heck, I'm watching the OSU/Minnesota game, and THE BUCKEYES are leading 14-0, just before halftime in "the Shoe"! GO BUCKS!!
