I am a US citizen and I support the new OPT policy.
I know some international students and I found most of them are very diligent and smart, and I think the US should offer those smart people a chance to work for the country. Moreover, the tech industry does need STEM students to fill in the positions because less American students are willing to do a bachelor in engineering or science.
However, I think some companies may abuse the OPT extension policy, and therefore I think a better regulation for the employers should be proposed.
