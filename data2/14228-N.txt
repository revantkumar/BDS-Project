I strongly oppose any program that robs American students of jobs, allows corporations to hire cheap, foreign labor, and rewards this behavior with tax breaks that cost us millions! That is why I oppose the OPT program in its entirety. The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. I would like my children and grandchildren to have expanded opportunities that this administration seems bent on giving to someone else. Not only do I oppose expanding the program by extending the visas, I would love to see this program ended all together.
