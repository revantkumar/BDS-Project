I support the proposal because it can be beneficial to U.S.
Some people hold the opinion that the proposal should be stop because it make him out of work. It is really ridiculous. The only thing them do is to blame others take over their jobs and never think about their faults. They never reflect what is the real cause of their out of work. If they work hard at school, if they push themselves very hard at work, if they are competitive, who can replace them? Those foreign people can make them know that no one can guarantee their jobs unless they make themselves competitive. The workers who are replaced are loser, we do not need to guarantee their job because they should be responsible for their faults, for their not working hard. The wanting to be competitive will push those people to learn more knowledge and to pay more attention to their jobs, which can be do benefit to our country.
