I support this proposal. I benefited from the OPT extension and made more contributions to my employer and my community. 

In my company, a Chinese cellphone manufacturer located in Texas, I improved efficiency of teamwork. Some of Chinese teammates are not good at English. By my translation and effort, they got along better with American colleagues.

For my community, I donated to a scholarship fund in my college, University of Texas at Dallas, as well as to two churches. As a member of community, I enjoyed making more friends and making the neighborhood better.
