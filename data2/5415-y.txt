Karishma Patil As one out of perhaps only 200 internaitonal dentists in studying in a dentistry program on a student visa I request you to add DMD and DDS to the STEM degree list and help healthcare professionals like us serve the rural population. The OPT extension would be of great help to students like me and other dental students.
