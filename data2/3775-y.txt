Tim Campbell International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. International students have become integral to the financial health of many US higher education institutions, but the impact goes beyond money spent on tuition fees and living expenses. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow them to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future.
