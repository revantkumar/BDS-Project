Zhongsheng Wang I support this policy for three reasons
If international students are not allowed to work in the country they received education, students may choose other countries to take practical training, which will have a bad impact on the American industry.
If international students leave the American after graduation, the culture diversity will be hindered.
If this policy is prohibited, less and less international students will further their study in America.
