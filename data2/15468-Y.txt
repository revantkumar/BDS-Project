Recruiting more foreigners are not a problem of "competing with Americans in the job market", but rather the key to keep US as the most competitive market and nation in the world. China is now fast growing as the second largest economic body in the world. They're trying their best to recruit foreign experts, skilled workers and students to improve their creativity and worker quality as a whole. On the contrary, Americans are trying to restrict their skilled students and graduates to 1-year short work in US and even force them to leave US afterwards. Over 50% of work in high-tech and cutting-edge industry is now done by foreign employees, even higher number in the R&D departments. Shortening OPT and forcing talented foreign students to return to their home country, Americans are "winning now for themselves" by gaining more job opportunities but "losing the future of their children" since talented outstanding labor and brain powers are leaving US.

Don't be near sighted and harm the creativity of US. Support OPT extension and keep US the most attractive country for the future.
