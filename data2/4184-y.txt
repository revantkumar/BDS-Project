Thomas Brown I strongly support the proposal.

Educated young talent are the most valuable resource for our nation's productivity. It is smart to let these people work for the US and not wise to drive them back to their own country and make contributions there.

American should be open minded to the world, don't forget we are the nation based on immigrants. But we should be very careful on which kind of immigrants are welcome to us.

Government should put more control on the massive, low quality, illegal immigrants, and simultaneously encourage these qualitatively small but high-quality STEM degree holders, for example, by giving them longer OPT time and higher probability to become a green card holder.

Only by doing this, we can keep the US to be constantly strong in the world. And only by doing this, every American people can benefit from the fact that the US is constantly strong in the world.
