As an international student pursuing master's degree in the United States, I'll tell my own experience about how STEM strengthen the United States. In my college, there are so many international graduate students who are equipped with high skills and knowledge and meet the practical demand of the technical and science companies, which support the leading technological status of the United States. Improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degree will also improve the technological development of the United States.
