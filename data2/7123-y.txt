Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a STEM graduate from University of Illinois at Chicago and non a H1-B visa holder. More than 50% of UIC graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. Many of my colleagues will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule. Also, lack of a fair practical training period may account to considerable decrease in qualified and talented international students entering into United States for education and training.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
I am glad my international colleagues are able to gain practical training experience in the US.

I am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.


I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.
