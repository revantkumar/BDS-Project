Ruxue Bai I strongly support this proposed rule by the Homeland Security Department. This helps the acquisition of talented people for America. America has always been welcome to the people who can bring benefit to this country, and students with STEM degrees should be considered a large population who meet this criteria. As we all know, the highly developed science technology in this country sets America the most influenced status in the world. In order to keep its leading status in the world, a lot of effort should be made in the science area. Once this rule is enacted, more talented people will be attracted to this country.
