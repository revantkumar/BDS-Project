My granddaughter is a highly regarded STEM student. This rule change will put foreign born students ahead of her in training opportunities and will greatly reduce her chances of being gainfully employed in her area of expertise in the foreseeable future. Why should I support a rules change that will use my tax dollars to make sure that my own grandchildren are put in line BEHIND foreign nationals who do not deserve these training benefits?

The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.

There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers, including my own grandchildren! Why???
