Here is the comment that I just sent to this administration. You too may comment, if you care about our country and its workers.
1) I noticed that foreign students, the ones who would benefit from this program, are most of the positive comments here. 
2) My wife has a masters degree in computer engineering, and several years ago found it impossible to get a job. As soon as a company saw that she was a U.S. citizen, they declined to hire her. Of course, why should they hire a current citizen, as they can "import" an Indian with the same skills for 1/4 the salary. I know that this is true, as we've traveled in third world countries for 6 full years, including India and China, and saw what they pay an engineer. 
Corporations know that these immigrant's home country income was tiny, and so they will happily work for a small fraction of our normal pay. A computer software engineer earns $5,590 (368,000 rupees) per year GROSS salary in India (66 Indian rupees/dollar):

WE HAVE the engineers now. Companies would rather import workers to pay far less wages!
