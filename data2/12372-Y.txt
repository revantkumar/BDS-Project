I SUPPORT this proposed rule. I think it can benefit the economy of the US in the long run by retaining talents. Here are my suggestions to improve this rule:

1) set up a black list of companies that abuse OPT and H1b (e.g. certain outsourcing companies), and those in black list will be forever barred from using OPT or H1b program.

2) In order to recruit students on OPT, employers are requested to give high enough prevailing wage (A reasonable specific number should be included in the new rule).
