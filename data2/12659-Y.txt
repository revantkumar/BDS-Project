I am a international student from China. I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons.
1. We international students gained knowledge from the USA should be allowed to work for the USA and create more value for the USA. 
2. the USA is widely regarded as a melting pot of different people from different countries. the core of the Americanism is its Inclusive and open. How can a country like the USA reject foreigners to join their social lives?
3. We foreigners are really contributing to the USA. We regard the USA as our second motherland in our hearts . We work hard in our daily life while being unknown to the public.We do things which native Americans don't want to do,we create value for our motherland in silence without being honored.
