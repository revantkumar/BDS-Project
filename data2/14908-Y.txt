I strongly support the extension. Here are my reasons for the support:

United States is currently facing STEM workforce shortage. This is just a fact. Companies like Facebook, Google hire international students not because they are cheaper labor force, but because US workers do not prefer to
obtain a Graduate degree (MS/Ph.D.) in these areas.

Most students come here for education mostly because of job opportunities. If the extension is removed, the chances of getting a job diminish significantly. This will simply lead to students not coming to the US for study.
