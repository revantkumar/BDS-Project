Ruobai Wang I support the OPT extension. USA keeps its leading position by attracting the best elites all around the world to develop itself. If the OPT extension fails, the elites will go back to the other countries, and USA could hardly keep leading the world, and the American people can not enjoy the lifestyle as a citizen of the most developed country now.
