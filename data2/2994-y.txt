Ben He I'm highly support this new policy. As a STEM major student who is currently using the OPT, I believe this new policy will allows me to gain more experience before I'm go back to my home country. 

This new policy will also attract more qualified STEM major students from all over the world to study in America. This will make the college campus in America more divers and allows the education system in America remains competitive.
