Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. 80% of UMKC graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. i and another international graduate students will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
I am going to use this STEM extension rule from June 2016, as per my knowledge about technology industry in USA, Most of the technical jobs are filled by OPT students. This rule also benefiting companies who are looking to fill these positions. 

I am very concerned with the possibility thatthe ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension]] might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.


Best regards,
