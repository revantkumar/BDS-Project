This is a great revision of the rule.

This gives great opportunity for student to apply their knowledge learnt in the universities in the real time industry.

This rule will definitely increase the number of students coming to USA for high quality education.

This rule also adds an advantage to employers who were willing to employ the immigrants such that they have enough time gap for the sponsorship of employee's H1-B visa.

Thank you for the revised rule.
