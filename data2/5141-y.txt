Rhushabh Jobalia Firstly, I would to express my gratitude to DHS for their efforts in order to meet deadlines. This STEM OPT extension will play a crucial role for international students to showcase their skills and grow up in the professional careers. This will be helpful for companies that are looking for young talent which can bring innovation and contribute to the company's success. I strongly support this initiative.
