I strongly support this proposed rule to extend the OPT period for F1 student with STEM degrees.

1. The reason many international students choose to apply for universities in US instead of UK, German, etc. is because of the previous 29 months OPT period (with extension). Without the extended OPT period, US universities lose a lot of international students who pay a great amount of money for the tuition and living expenses. Specifically, international students make up 4% of the total students across US and typically their tuition is at least twice the tuition for local residents.

2. The training and working experience is vital for both companies who hire students to grow and expand and for students themselves with relevant domain knowledge to learn how to work in an international company. Take the tech companies such as Uber, Airbnb, Google, etc. for example, a majority of their employees are not from US and without them many companies in the US will not survive and may be taken over by oversee companies such as Lyft, Baidu and so on.

I believe one of the core value of the US spirits is about its open cultural inclusiveness. We should not break it by creating barrier to stop foreigners from coming to this country. Incorporating talents from all over the world is how America leads in many areas today. If US wants to continue to lead and innovate as before we should learn how to value talents and legal immigrants.
