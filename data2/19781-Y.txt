A lot of talented foreigners are forced to leave US because of the limited H1-B opportunities. This is a huge loss to US, as these people have skills that are essential to the long-term development in economics, technology, and homeland security. Extending Training Opportunities for F-1 students is a great way of keeping these talented professionals and offering them opportunities to contribute to US with their knowledge and skills.
