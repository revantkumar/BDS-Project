I fully support STEM OPT extension. It is unbelievable and I was totally shocked when I saw some comments here. You can never blame others when you cannot find a job right? I know it's people's nature to find something (usually the government, society, immigrants..) to blame if they cannot do well in their lives. But this doesn't solve the problem. Thinking if hightech companies can never hire foreigners, what is the result? NOT more US citizens get the job (Do you really think Google will lower the hiring bar for that??? If so, even you do not want to use Google's service right?), but other foreign companies take place the older, US ones and make fortune from US citizens! So don't be stupid, let the foreign students work in United State and pay high tax and we can continue have all benefits we had today.
