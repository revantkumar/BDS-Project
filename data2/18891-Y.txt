I am working in a big company in USA, and currently in STEM. I applied for H1B visa twice, but no luck! 
Actually I spent three months on training before I really started working with my team. And right now I am good at my daily tasks. But actually my stem will expire next Feb if this proposal cannot get passed. If I leave this company, this will be a loss for my company and my team, because they will have to try to look for a good candidate for my position and then train them. For me, this is also very bad, which means I will have to go back to my country and get everything start over!
Please consider carefully about how important these good talents are to USA!
