I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in STEM fields. As a result, this would increase downward pressure on wages for all tech workers.
In a time when our sacrosanct social security system's funds are depleted and more American citizens are in need of increased benefits and expanded Medicare, this proposed rule would reduce the tax base to build federal funds. The myth of a shortage of technical workers has already caused irreparable damage to several industries in this country and promoted the replacement of hundreds of thousands of American technical workers with foreign workers.
Immigration policy should serve in the interests of Americans and minimize the impact of foreigners coming to suck at the teat of American plenty.
