I am a math major student. My GPA is top 1% in my college. I think expand training opportunity for F1 no immigrant student with STEM degrees not only helping us when we looking for a job after graduated, but also helping USA to gain more talent students in math/ science/ engineer area. I think this suggestion is a good opportunity to help USA gain more achievements.
