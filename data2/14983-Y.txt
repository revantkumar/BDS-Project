This policy will be of enormous value not only to international students, but (I guess) more importantly, to US citizens and the US economy in general. Think about all the public universities that are short of state funding (UIUC for example) and all the private universities that are having a hard time to secure donations due to the hard economic environment. Whether you want to face it or not, tuition from foreign students has long become the essential source of funding that higher-education institutions can't do without. Increasing the length of the OPT for STEM students will attract more foreign students to come and study in the US. If the OPT policies are to be left as it is now, the US educational market will quickly be caught up by that of other countries that offers more welcoming employment policy. This will be detrimental to the higher education system of US.
