I support OPT extension. Without extension, many qualified international students will lose opportunities to work legally in the U.S., which will cause a severe brain drain. This will severely affect U.S. technology and economy. Talented students need suitable platforms to develop their talent. It is a win-win, which will not only improve students' own skills, but also contribute to U.S. development.
