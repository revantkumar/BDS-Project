I strongly support the approval of this proposal. It is because it will dramatically increase the employment opportunities for US citizens and the competitiveness of US. US is needing more and more people with high level knowledge in STEM area, and not enough US citizens are there to fill all the positions. If there is no talented international students fill those positions, many companies would have hardship in their operations and development. As a result, it would be very difficult to create more employment opportunities for US citizens. Therefore, the talented international students with OPT extension will significantly increase the employment opportunities for US citizens.
