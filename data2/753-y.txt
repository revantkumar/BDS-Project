Cletus Berns The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students and recent college graduates over Americans. This program has never been authorized by Congress. Currently, foreign students who have been pursuing their degree for at least 9 months can work in the U.S. for 12 months or 29 months if pursuing a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree. The new rule would extend the program's length from 12 months to 36 months for these STEM students. The program incentivizes U.S. companies to hire foreign students and recent graduates because they do not have to pay the prevailing wage or their share of the 7.65% payroll taxes for the foreign worker, costing Social Security an estimated $1 billion dollars a year. Why are we hurting our retirement age Americans? This must end today to protect Americans. 

I suggest ending OPT and H-1B initiatives totally. America has 300 million people so any program that helps the economic competition that will hurt American STEM students MUST be ended immediately. Lets help our people first then if we have anything left over help others.
