Foreign STEM students are not "stealing" jobs from the US citizens. Today, almost all the major employers in the US state clearly in the job descriptions for the preferences of US citizens. STEM students are able to secure their jobs in the US for a reason: their skill-sets can meet the high demands of today's high-tech industry.

Foreign STEM students are not competing by lowering the bar of salaries. They work in the most competitive high-tech companies in the world. These positions require specialized, advanced education background in engineering and science. They are hired by the companies that are created by the most talented people in the world. Their salaries are above the average, and there are clearly reasons for that. 

This 24 months STEM extension is good news for the foreign STEM students and the high-tech industry. It should not be jeopardized by people who are afraid of competitions and refuse to think from a bigger picture.
