From my opinion, it's a good proposal. OPT is not permanent employment authorization in U.S.;most Americans seem over anxious and are so afraid of laying off by foreigners. In contrast, it's a good way to increase sensitivity of competition and ambition. Over the past years, a great number of young Americans preferred not learning science and became less competitive in science and advanced IT field, which is not good for a country's development. 
The proposal does not mean to infringe Americans' profit, however, it's exactly what U.S. must to face that young persons need to be hard-working to stand out among fierce competition.
