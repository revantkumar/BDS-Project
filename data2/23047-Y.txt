I support the immigration proposal. I have to say that I am shocked by some people showing their strong discrimination in the comments. Whether you can win a job position should depend on your education and expertise, not your citizenship or races. This proposal really encourage people, no matter international or local, to improve themselves in the STEM field in order to win the competition. On the other hand, great number of companies will benefit from the results, so as the economy in the US. Let people win the game through competition, not through disqualifying talented people in the game.
