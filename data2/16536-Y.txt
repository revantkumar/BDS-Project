I strongly support the new proposed rule against F-1 nonimmigrant students. I see a few things this new rule will have a positive impact to United States' economy, diversity and technology industries.

Keeping OPT extension means that we will not lose lots of talents who graduated from one of our top US universities. These students have already proved that they can quickly find a job in high-tech company and performed an excellent job on their work. These students have brought lots of revenues to the companies. And since these students work in high-tech companies, they also pay more taxes. On the reverse hand, if we don't keep the OPT extension, we would loose these revenues and also it might be a very bad impact for US reputation on international education. There will be less student will apply for US colleges because of this.

This leads to keeping diversity in US colleges. Currently, we have students from all over the world and this help the country to develop diversity. And I would like to see it continue to be this way.

If we lose these talented students, technology companies will not be happy about it. They hire thousands of international students every year. And these students are the driver for next generation technologies. Not keeping OPT extension would block our US technology advance.

In general, this new rule would help US in many aspects. I would vote agree on this new rule.
