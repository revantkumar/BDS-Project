I totally support this rule. It will definitely benefit both the economy and the U.S. stem works.

Based on the research of wes.org "International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the U.S. share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. A previous WES report noted that international students are a vital source of enrollments for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fieldsin 2013 more than one in three international students in the U.S. was enrolled in a STEM field. International students also help promote a global learning environment. A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership, and quantitative skills." The new rule on OPT extension will a great promotion for U.S. and will help it get the leadership in science and engineering back.
