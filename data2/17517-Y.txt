I am so confused why there are so many negative comments in that the OPT extension is definitely one of the best policies I can see for US industry. In global view, we can all see that talents are the critical factor in technology development. Take the IT industry for instance, each year we need a lot more employees with proficient skills to keep our industry in fast development. The international employees are never meant to, like some of you say, steal the jobs from citizens. On the contrary, they are contributing in keep the whole industry in its pace, and thus create more positions for the country. They definitely contributes to make the US industry competitive. Let's all look into this fairly, ok? I personally strongly support this policy to be approved.
