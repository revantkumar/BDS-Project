Connor Davidson International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future. Even with more than 13 million Americans unemployed, the manufacturing sector cannot find people with the skills to take nearly 600,000 unfilled jobs, according to a study last fall by the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte. Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
