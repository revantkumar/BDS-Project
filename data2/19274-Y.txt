This rule can largely benefit industries of the United States since currently the economy hasn't recovered to its best. It betters the opportunity for STEM instustries to find the best human resource for their positions and at the same time offers better training for international students. This will help speedy the economy recovery, so I support this rule and think that it should be enacted.
