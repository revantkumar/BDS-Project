Allen Zhang I totally support this new OPT 24 months extension rule!! 

I'm a recent graduated computer science master student. Now Im working for a big finical company in NJ as a Java developer with my 12 months regular OPT. My 12 months regular OPT will come to the end in February. I really need the OPT 24 months extension to continue work for my project, for my employer, and for the US. To let me make more contribution to the US.

I think OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, most IT department of US finical company. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

As a STEM student, I can either return back to my country or stay here to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development or finical IT development. However, I choose to stay here in US where I can get more opportunities and challenges for my career and make more contribution for US. So if I have about 3 years work experience in US, it would be a great improvement for me to better work for US company. 

It the reason that this new OPT rule would benefit both US and international STEM talents.

BTW, thanks US for giving me opportunity working here, and thanks DHS for letting us speaking out our idea. Hope this new rule will get approved eventually!
