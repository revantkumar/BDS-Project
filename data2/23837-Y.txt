Although I am already a citizen of the US, I myself originally came from Indonesia, where STEM careers are lacking. I am in support to extend international students stay in the US who have a STEM degree background because the US offers the best opportunity for exposure to STEM fields to those STEM students. Unlike other countries, the US is one of the leaders in STEM research with many fortune 500 companies who are developing cutting edge technology for a better future. For many international students, their original hometown may not be able to offer them the same opportunity they are offered here in US to apply their degree. Extending their stay will give them a chance to use their knowledge they learned in school and apply it to real life engineering problems and issues. For other international students who are on work visa, I think it would be great if they were given a longer stay period in order to gain longer experience and have the opportunity to work in a STEM company and learn the infinite possibilities that they can unlock. On the off chance they are able to make a breakthrough in technology, which they may not been able to do with elsewhere, and contribute to America as a whole, it would be beneficial to the US and possibly the whole world. That is why I'm pro extension of stay for international students in STEM fields.
