I really support this new opt rule.

First, international students contributed a lot to US development since they paid more tuition fees. The reason why US attracted international student to study in US stem from the training opportunities. The extension would further increase the attraction as students may gain more experience before they come back to home country. US diversity results prosperity while diversity comes from students come from different place of the world.

Second, training opportunities do not hurt the job market in US, instead, improving the job markets. International students benefit a lot to local people, like housing rental, restaurants. Even if students start their training, they will still need to rent the house, spend money at local, which boost the economy for US in long term.

Looking back history, there are tremendous number of accomplishments are done by international students. For instance, Xuesen Qian, an international students, later became a famous aerodynamics scientist. His work at NASA made a large contribution to the aircraft private A and also the development of American Space Shuttle. 

To conclude, I really support this new rule. It not only benefits US people also benefits US in the future.
