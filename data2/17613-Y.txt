Strongly agree on STEM OPT extension. 
I graduate from one of US top university and my graduate school payed a lot of my tuition. 
I used the stem opt period to find a good job and work for Mount Sinai Medical school. Most of the employees are international at my work place and would like to work for US longer. 
I believe without OPT, there will be a lot more people who funded by US during their graduate study and go back to serve their own country.It would end up with depleting the highly educated people from US.
