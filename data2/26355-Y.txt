I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Everyone has American dream, and everyone who is working hard can achieve it, regardless of race, gender, and nationality. This is the spirit of America imprinted in the constitution, which makes America the leader of the world over past hundreds years.
2. Boost economy. Wages paid to STEM works will become capital flow within America. More demand of goods, more supply will be needed. This also help create more jobs in other industries. It's a positive feedback loop, and boost the overall economy of America.
3. Companies like Google, Facebook and Tesla need talent all over the world to build products that help make a better world of human-kind. Only limited the talent supply within U.S. will definitely slower the pace of real world-changing companies grow.
4. On the other hand, if high-tech companies cannot found enough talent within U.S., they will out source technology positions outside America. Probably to Asia or Eastern European countries. The outgoing wages paid to other countries will definitely hurt consumer spending and the economics of U.S. in the long run..
