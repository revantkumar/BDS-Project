I would strongly support this new rule. The development of US surly needs high-tech employees. The companies hiring foreign students don't have any prejudice on US citizens. In fact, there are a lot of citizens who are working for high-tech companies. On the other hand, those who can't get the job should think why the companies don't hire them, all efforts will pay off, if you don't make any efforts, even if there are no OPT extension rule, you wouldn't be hired by these companies either.
