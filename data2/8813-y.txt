Anonymous I strongly recommend to pass the rules. Expanding the OPT is quite essential, I even suggest to have longer OPT time.

I also suggest this rule could apply for the liberal art and business students because they may also have the chance to work in high tech companies. 

In the next ten years, US companies will face extreme competition from companies outside America, especially from China. It is not reasonable to drive back the talented students. US economics may face another destruction like 2008 if we continuously lose blood to other country. STEM students could bring new jobs to US market since most of them will work for high tech companies, which will definitely bring more jobs to American citizens. 

The new rules will also protect US citizens because the rules have made sure only legal students could have the OPT authorization.
