I second this. First of all, international students pay a large sum of tuition to the school, typically 3 times higher then local residents. If there is no extension opt for F1 students, the attractiveness of american school will decrease a lot, those F1 students may turn to other countries like Australia or Canada, which means american's education system will lose a large part of income to improve overall public education. Second, the qualified graduated stem students have specialty that boost the company's productivity and revenue, especially in hi tech areas like computer science, material engineering and fundamental medical research, to let those students gone will decrease American's economy. Last, since American is a immigrant country, every year thousands of people immigrant to US to pursue their dreams, if the immigrants have American bachelor/master degree and specialty, this will improve the country's competitiveness in the world.
