I strongly support Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.
As I read some of the objection comments, one significant reason is that international students may take up some American's job. However, America is a country that striving from equality, freedom, and competition. Competition brings out talented people that U.S companies really need. There are sure a lot of competitions for jobs among international student and American, on the other hand there are sure a great deal of advantages for American in a job competition, at least in terms of communication, cultural background, and VISA issue. As the matter of fact, there are lot of companies still willing to offer jobs for international students out of all concerns. One reason is that some international students are really talented and they are good fits for their offered jobs after rounds of interviews. Beside, for some particular industrial such as IT industry, great deal of new blood is always needed to support the rapid growth of the industry. As a international CS student, I have to point out that international students takes up big percentage of all CS students. Simply confines candidates pool from citizen can not meet the need of these companies. 
Sure there are competing, but certainly is good for the business and industries.
