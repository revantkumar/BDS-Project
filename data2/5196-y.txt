Hank Tian I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:
1. It offers an equal field of competition between overseas students and domestic American students. For an overseas student to work legally in the US, he or she has to 1. obtain a special visa like F-1 or H1-b and 2. attain a job offer. The extended OPT period just offers an international student more time to find a job, but does not give him or her any advantage to secure a job, as they still need to get a job offer, which is totally dependent on the individual companies. Those American companies will never hire an overseas student if there are eligible domestic American domestic students. So this proposal will not give non-immigrant students any illegitimate advantage over Americans.
2. US is a country renowned for its open culture and friendly attitude toward immigrant. That's why talents from the world choose to come here and become its citizens. Those talents compose the majority of fields related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. If the OPT extension of STEM majors is abolished, US will suffer from the loss of geniuses.
