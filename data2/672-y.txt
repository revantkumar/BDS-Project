Samantha King This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. This will ensure continuous supply of young talented STEM graduates and promote growth of science and technology. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions. This rule will strengthen the relationships between America and other countries. That is, they can share more information, more resources and more opportunities.
