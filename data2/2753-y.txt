Vyankatesh Hejib Thank you USCIS for proposing the new rule for stem extension. Its a big relief for international students like us who want to gain valuable experience in industry after graduating. In todays world if you have a good experience, you will be able to get a good job, whether it is India or USA. So if we go from USA after finishing masters to our respective countries its like starting all over again as a fresher. Also we take an educational loan in our country which is a lot in terms of currency of my country and will take years to repay if I go back now as a fresher. So this rule provides a great relief to me. Also H1b visa is a lottary system so you cant predict whats going to happen there. So even if I dont get H1b visa still I will be having a good work experience and will be much more financially stable at the end of stem extension tenure. And this is not only my story, lot of people are in the same boat. So I think this rule should be officially published.
