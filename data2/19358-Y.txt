I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I am a postdoctoral researcher and adjunct instructor in Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of South Florida. I am currently using the 17-month OPT extension. Without the OPT extension, I would not have considered staying at University for further research since projects usually take more than two years. The OPT extension gives me more opportunities and time to think about and develop my future career. It also benefits universities in united states since it is easier for the universities to keep these talents with advanced degrees in school to strengthen the research competitive capability and teaching quality without worrying about applying H1B visa for them. I believe it has a positive impact on the entire society of united states.
