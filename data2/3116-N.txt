OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.
--Americans are daily losing jobs without the Federal Government giving a free ride to work for non-Americans. The Federal Government MUST assist in putting all Americans back to work before offering jobs to non-Americans. If our nation does not go back to work and compete on the world market, we will not have a nation. 

OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
--WE are the only nation on earth that does not take care of and respect our elders. Our elders helped to form this nation, fought and died for this nation, and now is the time for us to take care of them. Each year when the government needs money, they rob Social Security and Medicare. When will we begin to respect our elders?
