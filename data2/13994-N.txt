I oppose the Department of Homeland Security expanding the Optional Practical Training Program. This program incentivizes companies to hire foreigners at the expense of US Citizens. The USA should be hiring legal USA citizens and improving training programs for USA Stem workers. Why does our Democratic Party and President consistently throw USA workers under the bus? With current USA graduates struggling to find jobs, now is the wrong time to incentivize companies to hire foreign workers rather than USA workers.
