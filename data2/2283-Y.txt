I feel this is a very well thought Decision. It's a unique one where they have given something or the other for everyone (Organizations, Foreign Students,Government). It also gives all the students an opportunity to give back to the country where they have evolved and grown as professionals. I feel it's a WIN-WIN for everyone. Good decision.
