Howard Li I strongly support this rule. International students spend a lot of money in the US, for education and living. This is good to the economy of the US. Also, international students make a lot of academic contributions in the school. If the OPT is short, then there will be much less international students willing to study in the US. Therefore, this rule can attract more international students to the US and is beneficial to the country.
