I stand for the new OPT regulation proposed by DHS. "Are we a nation that educates the world's best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us?" Obama said in his nationwide address on Nov. 20. 2014 " Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here, create businesses here, create industries right here in America?" 

We all see international students made huge amount contribution to our economy, especially in STEM field in the past decade. The reason American is among the top choices for international students is its OPT and extension policy, which makes it possible for them to utilize what they learn. If this regulation is not able to pass, we lose our advantage over other countries in attracting those students, and this will hurt our economy in both short term and long term.
