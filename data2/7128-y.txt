Victoria Ackerson I strongly support this new ruling. 

OPT, even not a direct immigration issue, can also be related to immigration. OPT is itself a filter and will filter out people who are not good enough, as a three year period of working in a company is the best exam a student can take to prove his/her abilities. Those who are not good enough will get fired and go home. But those who can stay will have the option to either stay or leave after the end of the OPT period. The US government do not have to spend all the time and money and labor to come up with metrics to evaluate if an applicant is qualified for citizenship. Furthermore, a country needs immigrants, period. This is a fundamental economic rule that exists in nature. The two important driving force for economy are population and technology. Population-wise, companies needs demand to produce. Wont people eat and rent houses and buy stuff and spend money here and there after they start working under OPT? Why do people only see OPT worker taking jobs, but not see the other aspects? Remember the financial crisis in the 1930s? Nobody wanted to buy stuff, and companies had to stop producing, and so laying off workers.
