Leo Hao I think this is good for both new graduates and the companies. Some of my reason are as follows:
For new graduates, it's very good for their career that they could get some work/intern experience in some of the best companies in their field. As we know, America has the best environment and state of art technologies in nearly all STEM fields. 
For those companies, new graduates are in their highest level of knowledge in their life because they just graduated and passed all kinds of courses and tests. Which means they have a very open mind at this time, they are creativity and always have many thoughts. In my opinion, this is important for a company's development and improvement. Besides, new graduates are always enthusiastic and passionate. This could bring to the company with energetic, give the senior worker some competition. Which certainly is a good thing for companies.
And we all know that STEM fields are always important for country's economy. Apparently this is a positive policy for the US. We both win. So, why not?
