I strongly support the proposal because of the following reasons. 

First of all, U.S. is always a country that gathers the most talented people from all over the world, that's why it's the most developed country in the world. And also that's the foundation underlying all the efforts to build this country. Many people in those negative comments said that it's big threat for American citizens. But looking back history, where're all these "American citizens" from? Almost all of their ancestors are elites from all over the world. That's the charms of this country. That's the main difference from all other countries. 

Second, competition is always a good thing as long as it's in a healthy path. Competition makes people works harder, which promotes the development of economy. 
This is a country full of diversity and challenge for everybody. That's why this country gathers so many elites in almost all areas: technology, art, economy, etc. The healthy path is to make everyone works harder to get a job that he or she can qualify, but not to make sure everyone has a job with no efforts paid.
