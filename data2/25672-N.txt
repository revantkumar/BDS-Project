The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to another corporate welfare program not approved by the populace or Congress. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.

My wife and I are opposed totally to this expansion in the OPT program.
