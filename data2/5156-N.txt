It is unfair to us Americans that have always had citizenship in the United States, it is also unconstitutional, illegal and just plain WRONG. This (so called) proposal and the ones pushing for it are NOT above the law. In Minnesota alone, there are an estimated over 3,000 homeless children and growing, not to mention the many homeless Veterans and just folks out of work trying to recover from the last, recent recession we've had. This proposal is a spit in the face to the TRUE American. Recovery is what we Americans need, not foreign graduate students, not foreigners and for God's sake, no refugees or terrorists posing as refugees. We've had enough of disappointments with proposals that We The People of The United States of America had no choice in the matter. Enough is enough!
