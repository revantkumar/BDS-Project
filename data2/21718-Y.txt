I definitely agree with and vote for this rule.

I have several friends struggling with H1B visa problem issue. They are all professional engineers and good persons, working with F1 OPT. They had to leave US because they didn't get H1B visa for continuous 2 years. Their teams suffered a hard time by losing experienced, well-trained guys.

The rule is a good chance to change the situation for large amount foreign students and a lot IT companies.
