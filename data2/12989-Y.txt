I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSED RULE. This rule will achieve a win-win result for U.S. and international students. My reasons is as following:

STEM OPT extension can bring significant direct and indirect benefits to U.S. academic sector. A good Practical Training policy, which provides international students better opportunity to practice their knowledge and to learn from working experience, will definitely attract more brilliant and talented international students to U.S. In this way, academic sector can maintain global competition. The value created by international students is intangible and can't be counted by dollars simply.

As an international student myself, an important reason I choose U.S. than other nations is its OPT Extension program which will provide me better practical training. With only 12 month OPT, many STEM projects could not be finished entirely. OPT extension provide me a chance to participate in projects with a longer developing cycle from beginning to end.
