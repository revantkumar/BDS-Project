I am Lanka, graduating from Texas A & M Kingsville 2015. We came here not only for having the excellence of the education, but also for aquiring the enhanced industrial knowledge in this country. Even we have the enhanced education in our Country too.. If it is only for the sake of education we may not come to USA. We are coming here for the sake of education along with the industial training too.. If you are not going to give the opt stem for 24 months, for sure the percentage of students comming to USA will sliced to half. I kindly request you to give the stem for 24 months. Hope you understand
