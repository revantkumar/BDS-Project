Three years ago I came from China to America to pursue my Master's degree. I was a TA as well as RA. I worked hard and studied hard. My GPA was 3.9 and My advisor, who has been teach for over 25 years told me that I am the hardest working student he has ever taught and the most productive person in the research group. 

I graduated last May, and of course I was looking for an engineer position. Although it was hard for us foreign students, after submitting about one to two thousand resumes, I got two job offers in the same day. Last June 13th, I started working as a mechanical engineer for a company located in Houston. It's about one and half years since I started working and I never missed one single deadline and my boss is so satisfied with my performance. Under this terrible downturn in oil & gas, we got rid of over 2/3 employees and in Engineering department, there are only two people left: my boss (director of engineering and technical service, also came to US as a foreign student and just got his green card early this year) and me ( mechanical engineer). Can you realize how amazing it is that only two engineers can handle all the work? Including production line products and custom products. My boss told me he never liked all those native-born Americans and he likes foreign students a lot. Not because we are smarter, but we work harder. It's just that simple. 

It's not us foreign students take all your jobs, it's just many of so called "native-born" are just too incompetent to get a job. In this world , law of jungle applies everywhere. So, instead of whining and crying over how we should leave this country, why don't many of you stop smoking weed, go to party less and start studying hard, working hard and teach your kids so?
