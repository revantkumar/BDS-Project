I oppose the DHS's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. The program creates an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
