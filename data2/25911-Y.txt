I'm an engineering student. I would like to say something here. The STEM majors are different from others. Some of the ameircans are affraid of we will taking their working opportunities. But in my opinion this is not true. Our international enginner students can only get the opportunities for OPT if we are really good at the fields we are working in. I mean, way more better than the native Americans that are in those feilds. Since US is a diverse nation from the time it wad built, why not give the opportunities to us, which will give a lot more contributions to US even than you native Americans. If STEM OPT is not going to be expanded, almost all of the international engineers have to go back with lots of disappointment. I dont think its a smart choose for US.
