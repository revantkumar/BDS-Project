Li Yongqi I absolutely do agree that the government should give the students the expanding training opportunities,it is just a action that can higher the possibility of those students get a job after years of study.I do not regarde this as a competition,the economy is worldwide now and America is undergoing a transition of economy from industry to services.Not that I am saying native Americans do not pay enough attention to the technological changes,you have to admit most students focusing on those are from Asia!If the government do not give them the opportunity,for students,this is just job-losing problem and they can fix this problem by go back homeland.But losing a huge mount of oversea students is not beneficial for America.
