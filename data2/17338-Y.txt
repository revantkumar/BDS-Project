I strongly support this proposed rule, and I will justify why with a real-life example. I work for an automotive company and my team's product (very futuristic and cutting-edge technology) is gaining popularity in the market. The forecast looks very bright for the product. Since the demand is going north, we need more talent to keep my with the work. We kept trying to hire qualified people for over a year. The job advertisement was out in all the big job portals. After spending a lot of money in resource finding over a year, we got tired. Our HR department was trying the best to fill up the vacancies. On one hand the demand was going up and on the other hand, the work load was increasing on the existing workers. They started quitting their jobs due to high work load. Still no luck for my team and my very bright futuristic product (the market is estimated to be around $10 billion now). Finally, we opened our jobs to OPT students, and immediately the vacancies got filled up. They are very talented employees. With little training, they are able to match up their very experienced counterparts. 

This is from my own experience (I work for a company with revenue over $36 billion annually) and the truth is there is definitely a dearth of qualified resources to support our businesses. Our businesses are expanding and I need qualified people to work for these businesses. Expanding the OPT STEM period to 24 months will definitely help the OPT students to retain their jobs.
