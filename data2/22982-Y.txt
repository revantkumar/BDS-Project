I think this proposed rule should be approved. 
Three reasons: 
1. STEM students with high abilities in their major fields are more likely to stay in the states, as they have a chance to enter more than one lottery for the working visa. 
2. STEM students who don't do well on their major fields are not likely to get jobs when they graduate, and thus it will never make native Americans hard to find jobs. 
3. Working visa H1B is not an immigration visa, and it depends on the companies whether they want to apply for immigration visa for their employees who hold H1B.
