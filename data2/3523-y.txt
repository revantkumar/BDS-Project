Anonymous I abdolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. The U.S. should let the international students majoring in a STEM, as those students can contribute greatly to US economy. Can you imagine when the tech industry of US collapse? If international students cannot have enough time to find a job in US, they will just go to China or India. I do not think this is good for US. Those foreign students come to US, take advantage of best university system in the states, and go back to serve their own country--is that a good deal?
