Kim Hitchens Words cannot adequately express how utterly opposed I am to the dept. of homeland security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This proposal would amount to nothing more than corporate welfare. Giving preference to hiring foreign tech workers when there are American workers who can easily fill the jobs, (and who are in desperate need of jobs !) so that wealthy corporate elitists can put more money in their "pockets" by paying foreign workers less than American workers would be paid, and by not paying the payroll taxes that should be paid, is extremely anti-America and anti-American !!!! This proposal must not be allowed to pass.
