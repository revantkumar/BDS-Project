The OPT extension is very helpful for students who study in the United States. They can enrich their practical training experience after they get the degree from the colleges. This is one of the most important advantage and appealing point for US higher education system. 

The technical company will also benefit for this rule since it provides them to find potential employee for filling the shortage of labor in the highly growing IT field. It also protect the technical companies from the shock of the H1b lottery in which they can not guarantee the H1b visa for their new hires in one year period.

Thus I do not see any advantage for shutting down this rule and it will be very disappoint if it is disabled.
