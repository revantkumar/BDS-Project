I strongly support this proposal for letting OPT students have more opportunities in the US to work. Our country was built by the dedication and hard work of many generations of immigrants before us, there's no reason to turn back these students working toward that same goal now. Frankly, the comments saying we should drive illegal and legal immigrants away on this commenting board disgusts me. The reason why US is the most powerful, influential and technologically advanced country in the world is because our country has attracted so many brilliant young minds into coming here and building their careers, thus helping us as a country, to succeed globally.
