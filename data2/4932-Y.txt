I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS DECISION!. 
1.Give more time for talented foreign students to practice their skill is really reasonable. 
2.It will be good for American economy as well because the smart and talented students are always doing a good job on their positions. 
3. This policy will attract more smart and talented students come to America to study and all the universities and colleges will get the benefits.
