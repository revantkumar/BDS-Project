Adithya Indarapu The OPT allows students to work in their respective fields by applying what they learnt during their course of masters. Whatever the student learns during the course of masters, he should be able to apply the learnt techniques in real world and see the results. The OPT allows students to do this. But, the initial 12 month OPT is a very less time frame. Typically a project takes more than 12 months in many cases. Hence, the 17 month extension plays a vital role in continuing the project which they take on and complete it. The extension from 17 to 24 months is good for all students. It provides more hands on time for students to work in their fields and gain deeper insights. A masters student is well trained during the course of his study and few students excel in their fields during the course of study. When a masters student is ready to work, he can learn on his own and implement new methods. Hence, I feel that the employer does not need to show that they have the resources to train students. Myself being an undergraduate in Computer Science, already worked on quite a few projects and gained industry level experience during the course of study and now that I'm a Masters student, I can learn more things and implement them with out being trained by someone. The paperwork is a burden to the employer, student and the DSO which might put the employers in a dilemma whether to hire or not to hire a STEM OPT student. The proposed rule is good in all the aspects except for the paper work, training and mentorship program. The new rule should be implemented with the 24 month extension, reduced paper work, with out the mentoring and training program.
