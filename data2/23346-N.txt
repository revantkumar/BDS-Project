We are keeping an eye on the Republicans we elected last year. If they continue on this path, they can be assured they will be voted out of office the next time around. It is absurd, that with so many American citizens unemployed, our elected officials are catering to foreigners. We do NOT need anymore in the country, and this has to stop, right now!
