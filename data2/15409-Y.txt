I think the proposed extension to OPT is prudent and well deserving. Many international students come to USA not just for the outstanding education and research opportunities available here but also for the opportunity to learn through practical implementation which is quite often not possible to do in our home countries due to lack of proper support system or infrastructure and OPT really helps us in this respect. While it certainly is a delicate task to not disadvantage local population and at the same time further scientific endeavors by attracting bright talent from all over the world, we must remember that USA has always been gracious and righteous in providing equal opportunity to everyone historically and that is one of the major factors which shaped and defined this country as the land of free. Finally, with increased oversight and proper procedures to retain only bright talent I believe this OPT extension will add to the collective benefit of everyone.
