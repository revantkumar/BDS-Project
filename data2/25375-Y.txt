I support this rule and I'm very happy that F-1 students in STEM divisions are getting more opportunities to improve their skills. It's not very easy to complete a post graduate degree in STEM fields and it would be harsh if students didn't have the chance to supplement their education with proper practical training. I hope this rule helps students gain more practical skills so that they can stay and contribute to the nation's and employers interests for an extended period of time.
