Jean Campbell We have to keep our American citizens, both older and younger, able to make a living!!! Less welfare makes a stronger America so that self respect again is part of our American way. We've become a weak, entitled country, especially regarding our younger people. We'd better begin checking out past voting records of the people we elect. They are NOT voting on our behalf.
