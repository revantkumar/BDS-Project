Deborah Hernan Dear Mr. President,
You have proven time and time again that you do not care for Americans. You have proven time and time again that your alliance is with illegal aliens, and foreign born immigrants that are here to steal our jobs. It is unfair. Stop this nonesense of handing our jobs over to these people. The true Americans need jobs, they need these jobs. Don't give companies a break by allowing foreign invaders in to steal our jobs. fine any employer that hires one of these people before an American.
This country is in crisis. As a once middle class hard working American I am angered at the state you have let this country sink to. Because of you and your administration I am now a working poor, living paycheck to paycheck. My job will soon be ending because it requires me to be bilingual. I don't want to lean another language. I am an American and deserve American rights.
Your dreamers should be deported and your precious foreign born immigrants that you are handing our jobs too should be deported immediately.
I respect the office of the Presidency, but you sir I have no respect for.
