Hi,I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE due to the following reasons:

1) This rule will attract more talented foreign students to come to U.S. and serve for the society of U.S..

2)The coming foreign students will not only study and work in U.S. but they will also consume much stuffs, which will stimulate the substantial economy of U.S..

3)U.S. as an immigrant country should be patient to treat every foreign people, they need more time to find the job which is suit to them, then which will make them discover their value and create value for society of U.S..

Whatever, this is an awesome rule we need to support, please pay attention for foreign people in U.S..
