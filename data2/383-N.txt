The expanded OPT program will allow most participants to pay NO money into Social Security or Medicare. With the SS Fund already shortchanged, what will adding almost 700,000 new workers into the system who aren't paying SS do to the fund? It will also take hundreds of thousands of jobs from Americans and give them to foreigners. Common sense should prevail here. Plus while most of those tech jobs pay a decent salary, there is nothing that requires those unscrupulous employers to pay that prevailing wage and as a result, it will drive wages down for everyone. Then of course, everyone in the world knows that once you come to America, you never have to leave because our immigration laws are not enforced. The big businesses such as Disney, Toys R US, QUALCOMM and Microsoft, etc, that are lobbying hard for this expansion have a lot of nerve lobbying for this expansion because QUALCOMM has announced layoffs for 4500 Americans and Microsoft plans on laying off 7500 in the coming year. So, why are they lobbying so hard to hire foreigners? They want to swamp the job market with cheap, no-tax foreign works angling to become permanent.
