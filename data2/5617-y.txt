Frank Thomson Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. This rule is very beneficial for retaining talented international students.
