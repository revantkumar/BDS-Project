The American middle class is being eroded away at what seems to be a faster rate than can be sustained. This proposed rule will only further the erosion of the middle class by providing jobs with middle class salaries to foreign graduates. Further, this rule will have actual costs to the tax payer, which are projected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, with no estimable cost benefit to the American worker. For every one of these OPT jobs being given away, this can be counted as displacing an American worker in the same field, and eliminate her or him from the ranks of the middle class to the burgeoning poverty class in this country. The amount of food stamp recipients and young people burdened by college debt is a testament to the oncoming crisis faced by the middle class in the US today. I do not think the US tax payer should subsidize a program at hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of this rule without being able to project a tangible (viz. quantifiable) benefit to American workers. For many middle class families, college tuition is becoming more and more less affordable. Those who can "afford" to obtain advanced degrees in any field, appear to only be able to do so by taking on large debt. American graduates depend upon receiving employment at competitive wages after graduation, and this rule allows jobs that would otherwise be taken by American workers to foreign graduates. I strongly oppose this rule, especially noting that this will cost American tax payers to implement the rule, and also noting that the economic impact of displacing American graduates and driving down wages will further harm the bottom line of the American middle class.
