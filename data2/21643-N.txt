Are you kidding me? Our young people are having trouble finding jobs, even as college graduates, and these imbeciles want to give more jobs to foreign students. Time to kick the bums out of congress and the executive branch and to put people in office who understand the problems of the working class in this country. Imagine veterans coming back from doing combat overseas only to find that jobs they could have had have been given to people who have contributed nothing to this country. What is wrong with our politicians?
