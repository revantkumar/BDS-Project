This is a welcome development.
As the US needs the talent from outside its boundaries, helping students acquire cutting-edge experience through the OPT and STEM extension programs is a win-win for all.
While the onus of making sure this change won't affect the ability of US citizens to get a job
is on the government, I think everyone should consider more than "money" or "bottomline" in the
hiring process in deciding whom to hire. This will also save a lot of new grads willing to work in US for some time a lot of hassle trying to obtain an H1-B visa.
The US economy will continue to benefit from immigrant and non-immigrant workers.
Providing legal non-immigrant talented students in the STEM fields with the opportunity to
apply their freshly-obtained knowledge in the industry is a welcome step in boosting the talent pool working for the US economic machine as well, benefitting the US citizens more than is immediately apparent.
