I strongly support the 24 months stem extension. As an international student, I came to US for knowing United States is a great platform bringing equal opportunities for people to get high education and pursue their dreams. The extended stem period is a great opportunity for talented international students to get real practice in U.S. It is also a great boost for US ecnomoy and attract more talented international students to come to US to study.
