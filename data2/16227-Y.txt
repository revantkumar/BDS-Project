I fully support the amendment to the stem opt extension from 17 to 24months .
This gives students valuable time to implements the skills they learnt at school in the real world.
This also gives the unique insight to employers to learn about opportunities and expand their business into various markets. This also helps the nation grow economically and make scientific progress.
