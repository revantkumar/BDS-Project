I support expanding training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees. 

The reason that USA is leading the cutting edge technology is that USA is welcome to all talented people. There are countless contributions in scientific and industrial field made by immigrants. 

We all know Einstein is immigrant. But we also need to know Satya Nadella, new CEO of Microsoft is also immigrant. Sunder Pichai, current Google CEO is also from India. There are countless potential excellent engineers ,who are currently international STEM students, that could build another Google or Microsoft. Had Satya missed his H1b visa and were sent back to India, what a great loss to USA it could be? 

More importantly, those potential engineers can expand the industry, expand the company, thus creating more job opportunities for more people. If, say, those talented young minds have to leave the country due to visa, those companies have to open up overseas branches anyway (and that's what they are doing now!). So those who cannot compete for the job won't get the job anyway.
