I strongly support the new rule. Most of Americans believe foreigners have privilege in finding a job in US. That's definitely not true. It is much much harder for a foreigner to find a job in US than a local. And it subjects to a lot of constraints like H1B quota. Every year there is only 85,000 quotas for foreign students and the number of people applied for it is much higher. In 2015, there were 233,000 applicants, which means only 36.6% of them are lucky enough to stay. Those unselected need to leave the country if their OPT run out of time. After spending so much effort to find a job, those foreign students are pending on a lottery to secure their jobs. If you assume the companies are willing to take the risk of lossing an employee and restart the recruitment process after a few months just to save this 7% in salary, then I would say this is ridiculous. Why not just hire an intern? The companies hire a foreigner because they are better than the local people for the same position. I agree that for a foreigner, he or she has less bargain power than a local, especially true for a fresh graduate. But it is never wrong for a company to save as much as possible money in order to invest, to grow, to expand the business. Otherwise it will die, period. A company is never for public interests. If you want to get a good job, be competitive. It causes companies so many troubles to hire a foreigner than a local; as long as a local is equally good as a foreigner, or even a little bit worse, I'm 100% sure the company will choose a local guy. The whole OPT program just gives the foreign students a second, or maybe third chance to get selected in the 85,000 quota lottery.
