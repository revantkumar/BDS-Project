! The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. The Obama administration is making it so an employer would financially benefit by hiring a foreign student with a STEM degree, which is one in the field of science, technology, engineering or math, over hiring an American's child with the same degree. The OPT program gives employers financial benefits of up to $12,000 per foreign student they hire. This program violates the constitution in several ways; equal protection of the law, unless the arrogant Obama regime says otherwise. This program deserves our hate as it discriminates against Americans and uses our tax dollars to do it! There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers in the U.S. If that were true, wages for those workers would be accelerating rapidly. They are not; wages for STEM workers have been flat for years. The same cannot be said for revenues for big tech employers. Those have been growing rapidly in recent years. Just what doesn't the Obama administration get; Obama whines about lazy Americans who won't work to earn a STEM degree, but when they do he stabs them in the back. Many STEM degree holders are working out of their field because the federal govt incentivizes hiring foreign workers to the detriment of Americans; that is nothing short of a betrayal to America's children. The same Americans the federal gov't is suppose to represent and protect. It's obvious the corrupt OPT program is designed to circumvent the H-1B foreign worker caps. Americans aren't stupid; there are no jobs Americans can't do. Obama's policy for American workers should be, Americans Come First! Stop kissing the butts of the greedy high tech companies
