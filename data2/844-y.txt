Xiaoxi Dong I strongly support this new rule. 
First, some mentioned that US does not have a shortage of STEM workers, which is so untrue. The companies not only need STEM workers, but truly qualified skilled workers. A master student who have been in the university for 6 years is not the same as someone who attend a training course for 3 months. The poor high school stem education prevents the universities to produce enough skilled workers. 
Also, OPT program is directly related to US educational institutions and is fundamentally a selling point of the US educational market. A lot of people come to the US rather than go to other countries because of this benefit. If the extension was canceled, then it would be a threat to the US educational institutions financially. No one would ever want to bring CASH to the country anymore in exchange of education. US will lose its biggest advantage over other countries. 
And the same time, people cannot equate OPT with the general immigration problem. OPT is very restrictive - only granted to those who have studied in a US institution. It is not even immigration. It is funny that US allows a lot of illegal immigrants to come to this country for free but does not give qualified people who are anxious in creating value for the United States to stay. 
The fundamental reason for the extension to be 24 months is that a lot projects are 2~3 years long. It would be very much a trouble for companies to switch among different workers for the projects.
In summary, I think OPT extension is not a threat to the US and US citizens, but rather a benefit for exactly the US universities, companies, economy as well as each STEM students. It is a win-win!
