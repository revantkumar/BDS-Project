Li Tang I support OPT extensions for STEM F-1 students. These students received very good education in science and technology fields from American universities. They can and will give contributions to US econonmy recovery. Currently US is not in a situation of too many technology workers can't find a job, instead, the job market has a lot of technology openings hard to fill.
