The United States gives a fantastic opportunity to students and researchers to come to this country and pursue their education. I believe that after graduation, it is the time for students to return the favor to this country by hard working in companies and industries and keep their knowledge in this country. Without OPT extension, a great portion of this group of valuable people must leave the country and it is a loss for both people and the United States. I do believe that 24 months OPT extension will benefit all of us. Thank you!
