Danielle Long I support this proposal.

Just look up those Nobel Price winners who are not native Americans but still made huge contributions to US, they first start by applying for jobs in US and by having the opportunity to work in scientific fields. 

I believe allowing F-1 students with stem degrees to work would definitely facilitate the progress of US economy. My own company having so many foreigners who are working hard and being very good at what they are doing, a bunch of them are holding the F-1 with OPT visa. There is one position requires longer working time and very high level professional techniques has been vacant for over a year, and finally been field with a student of having opt extension and now we have applied for H1b for him.

Some people say that F-1 students took out jobs, I think that's not true. There is always opportunities out there, it is the matter of how hard you are willing to learn and try.
