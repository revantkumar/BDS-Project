The duration of an extension would be set at 24 months, rather than limited to a shorter period, due to the complexity and typical durations of research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields. 
Nobody will believe we can complete a project within one year with lots of obstacles and last minute surprise. 24 month is an adequate period which is not too short or too long for international engineering students to contribute America to finish a project.
