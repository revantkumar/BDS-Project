Shuake Wuzhati I strongly support extending the OPT for STEM F-1 students. From employers point of view, hiring and training new employees costs company resources including money and staff time. With longer practioning time, these talented, hard working F-1 will have more time and more opportunities to contribute, and to give back the companies. From America's point of view, giving more time to talented and hard working students after their graduation will incentives more innovation, which will make this an even better country, a country that is made of many many talented and hard working people who are enjoying and proud of this very equal opportunity.
