STEM students are often asked for in the related industries, which are short in labor supply. I think this 24 months extension can actually improve the US service industry a lot by providing extra good labor. Students with STEM that can find a job are usually the best students within their subjects, their contribution and existence in Banking, Consulting, IT Services in US greatly reduced the pressure of the small and large firms, which will give US a huge advantage around the globe on service industry.
