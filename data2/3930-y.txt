Dear DHS - I am currently a Postdoc Researcher at ME Department at Stanford University, I have spent my best five years obtaining my PhD degree in United States, thanks to your institution, that I finally had a chance to pay back and serve this country in my OPT duration. Our research undertakings would help tens of thousands of people alive by designing state-of-art surgical robotics and contributing to the community for the sampling validation and training. However, this purpose would by no means be fulfilled, as my ordinary OPT will expire the beginning of next year, while the research plan has been renewed to the September. I believe there are many cases like myself, therefore I urge you to approve the regulation, and we will spare no effort for such interest for not only Americans but also the entire human beings. Thanks very much for your consideration!
