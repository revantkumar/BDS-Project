This is my second comment on this proposed rule. I would like to give more details on why I am supporting this proposed rule. 

First, I question the rationality behind the statement of "because of the OPT regulations, foreign STEM workers are replacing American STEM workers". Following are my reasons:
1. According to myvisajob.com, plenty of H1B workers (especially in the STEM field) were directly hired from schools outside of U.S. They did not even get their education in the U.S. They have nothing to do with this OPT rules. The only interpretation of this phenomenon is: Companies would never be satisfied with candidates in the U.S. job market. They will always find their way to seek for the best candidate for a position in a global scale. Limiting educated, skilled and legal workers is not THE WAY to providing more job opportunities for U.S. citizens. 
2. The OPT rule has been one of the attractions for many international students to come to the U.S. for education. In November, 2014, the U.S. government recorded 900,000 international students in the U.S. Most foreign students are paying TRIPLE or EVEN FOUR or FIVE TIMES for tuition compared to U.S. citizens. For foreign students, almost 100% of undergrads are paying full tuition at international student rate without any form of financial supports from U.S. sources; for international grad students, their tuition are even higher than undergrads'. Additionally, most international students are from middle class family and wealthy family. Foreign students' contribution to the U.S. economy does not only reflect on their tuition, but also includes all their spending within the U.S. Not to mention they bring tourists to the U.S. (Their friends and family). The implicit economical benefit from international students is uncountable. The OPT rule is always an advantage for the U.S. to attract international students, who have been contributing to the U.S. economy tremendously.
