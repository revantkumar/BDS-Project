I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. U.S. is the most advanced country in the world. In order to keep it top 1 country status. It should be more open for foreign students who will contribute more to The U.S. and make the U.S. more competitive. 

2. U.S. should keep diversity which will bring the U.S. a lot of new ideas

3. Howvever, U.S. could be more strict on reviewing the qualification of applicant to avoid some fake applicants.
