I support the extension of opt to 24 months. Think about the fact that most foreign STEM students perform much better than American students and that Americans do not wanna go to PhDs because it is NOT easy! Yes of course Americans can be protected from competitions in research area and technology companies. But it is the diversity that make this country powerful.
