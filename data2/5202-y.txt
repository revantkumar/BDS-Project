mounika jaya chandra This OPT will attract more international students to choose US universities over those of other countries, and thus eventually benefit the US economy. International students normally pay out-of-state tuition that can be twice or three times as much as what local students pay. Combined with living expenses, one student may contribute tens of thousands per year to the US economy, which creates more than one job for the locals.
I feel it is a win win situation and extension has to be given.
