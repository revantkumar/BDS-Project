Amanda Zhang Of course I support OPT extension. 
1)International students lighten the financial pressure of universities even the government. International students pay higher tuition than domestic students. The tuition is twice or triple of domestic students'. Because of them, universities and colleagues do not raise or raise a little tuition every year. And universities are providing better facilities. Further more, universities don't need more support from government as before and the government can pay more attention to other parts to improve the quality of citizens' life. 
2)It is appealing to talents and those talents can make a contribute to USA. Why most international students prefer USA, because USA respects diversity and provide OPT for them to gain industry experience. Always taking in talents with different backgrounds is why this great country keeps advanced and can recover from 2008 economy crisis sooner than those european countries. 
I can not imagine how those companies work without international students. Without opt extension, there will be many openings indeed. But can those current unemployed people fill in? The answer is of course not and I am sure that is a disaster to those booming companies and the economy of this country.
