I am writing to oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule expanding the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years, making this in effect an H-1B program expansion, since the H-1B is also valid for three years. These companies would also be able to avoid paying their payroll tax share, saving them 7.65% of the employee's pay. This program creates a strong incentive for companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans. With U.S. college graduates struggling to find work, and labor force participation the lowest it has been in decades, this is not the time to give companies good reasons to hire foreign nationals rather than U.S. citizens.
