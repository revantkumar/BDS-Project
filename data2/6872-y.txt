Alex Xu, Princeton University I strongly SUPPORTS the proposal. The U.S. will definitely benefit from the policy.

Nonimmigrant students contribute money to a lot of universities! Tens of thousands nonimmigrant students are pursuing their degree (especially masters') in Harvard U, Columbia U, CMU and other pricy private universities now. Each of them has to pay roughly $50k per year to the universities. Even though PhD students do not pay for the tuition, their advisors pay for it! Most of those students WILL NOT have a chance to work and stay in the States at last, but they still come to the States motivated by the degree and a short working experience. The latter improves their resume dramatically when they come back to their own countries. If there is not extension in the future, companies will not want to hire nonimmigrant students. They will lose the motivation to come, pursue a degree and contribute money to the States.

STEM students are doing something that most people don't like to. Don't forget why only STEM has the extension. Students in the States like to go to business, law and medical school. We lack people who are devoted to STEM research, because such research earns less money but takes more time than lawyers and doctors. We need researchers to keep us the greatest country in the world. If most if our students don't want to learn STEM, let nonimmigrant students do it! Don't worry for competition, as they have long way to go to become a U.S citizen and can stay here forever. 

The extension of OPT will not harm you at all. It will definitely benefit the States!
