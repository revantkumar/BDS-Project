Assuming the purpose of Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a plan to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned. The reality is, more often than not, its used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and for employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.

By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT "experiment" to 3 years, the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid, there is little doubt that this regulation has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional LAWS.. The OPT regulations are irresponsible and dangerous at best. This "regulation IS a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. As stated This DHS OPT rule effectively requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.

Also noted there are no training or educational requirements defined in this program. This "regulation" is just one more foreign worker program and it has little to nothing to do with students. Since the bonus given to employers for hiring a Foreign graduate (worker) is worth $10,000 it is more profitable for an employer to hire a F-1 student than a citizen graduate. It's an over-reach to claim that someone who completes a degree in as little as 36 months needs 36 months of interning. The logic used to determine the OPT visa time frame is straight from the lobbyist claimed playbook and is not supported with any factual studies.

As admitted in the first sentence OPT is a form of employment. Clearly, the regulation is NOT meant for educational purposes but is in the end an employment program for foreign workers who claim student status..
