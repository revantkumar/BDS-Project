I strongly support the claim of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees with an extra 24 months extension. 

Firstly, this extension will give current F-1 students with STEM degrees more time to find a full-time job after graduation. Meanwhile, the 24 months extension will also serve those who get a STEM related job right after graduation a more sufficient working period of a total 3 year at their job positions. Even if they failed to get a h1-b visa to work for a longer time, a 3 year should be a fair time to both the employers and employees. Usually, a STEM related jobs are more technical, which means the people who work at a STEM related position will play a fairly critical role. For example, if a talented STEM graduate get involved in the development of a project or software have to quit on the way just because of the one year OPT without any extension nor h1-b visa, it will cause harm to both the development and the people himself. But, if he can have 2 years extension, situation will be much different. 

Secondly, the extension will encourage more talented people to seek for a higher level education in the U.S.. Here, in the U.S., the most developed country, the education and technology are most advanced. The reason behind this is right from its ability to improve its own technology growth as well as uniting the most talented people from all over the world. With the 24 month extension, the resources in the U.S. will be more attractive to those talented and ambitious people from all over the world. Reversely, an OPT without extension will greatly harm the passion of coming to the U.S. to seek for more education because of the potentially limited time of practicing knowledge after graduation. 

In the end, I want to re-state my support for this OPT extension claim. I believe that the OPT extension will become a win-win thing for all.
