I support the OPT extension because the U.S. IT industry needs high skilled foreign workers. Without the extension, high skilled foreign would have to return to their home country if not selected in the H1B lottery. With the extension, these graduates will have more chances of being select in the lottery and stay in the United States. 

Some would argue that these foreign workers steal americans's jobs. I strong disagrees with that. STEM apply mostly to workers in the IT industry where Americans do not want to work in. Also, foreign workers moves America's economy forward, therefore create more jobs for Americans. America needs to keep world's talents instead of letting them go back to India or China and compete with us.
