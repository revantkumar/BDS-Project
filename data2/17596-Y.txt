As an international student, I am so pleased to have chance to study in my university to chase a higher degree for my academic career. We came to America to take further study for our major, because we like the area we are studying in and you can provide us a higher and better environment to study. We all take this experience as a treasure when we go back to our mother country. My major right now is electrical engineering and it is part of STEM. My goal is to become an engineer after my graduate study and if for engineering development, it is better to have more chances to take practice in some real company. It is really helpful to provide us more opportunities to have an experience to work in the industry and we can use this experience to help grow ourselves. When we go back to our own country, we will all become the proficient engineers and we can easily to donate our knowledge and technology in the development of the industry in our country.
