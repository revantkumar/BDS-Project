James Tsu I Strongly support OPT extension program. As I know, it is very important to provide 3-years practical time for international students to work on US. US University spend a lot of resources to train international students and it is important to give them to opportunities to work in US and contribute back to local and federal economy. These people who are not qualified will leave US anyway since the opt extension require e-verify employers. OPT extension can help US filter these talented people and even they leave US after 3 years working, they will have a better understanding of US culture and US spirit which will benefit the relationship between their home country and United Sates.
