STEM degree students had contributed a lot to prosperity of United State. They had shown great hard work and intelligence on high tech industries. As a graduate student who had been U.S. for 4 years, I was fortunate to work with many fellows and industry elites who stayed in U.S. to realize their American dream, while sustaining their family.

Life is already difficult and hard for those who are not citizen and green-card holder. Extending OPT is just way to allow the hard working contributors to stay in U.S. for potential work. The affect of extending OPT does not have anything to do with any citizen's social welfare. The extension to OPT is to give hope to those who still have a dream in U.S. Please do not break the dream!

I can't see a reason why we couldn't extend the OPT.
