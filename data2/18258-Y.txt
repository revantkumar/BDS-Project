I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First of all is that when I chose to get educated in the US, there was better working experience than other countries. However, if this STEM extension has been cancelled, the attraction of applying a US university is definitely going down, compared with the UK, Canada, Australia and so on.

Second, diversity is the cornerstone of the success of America. Were not there so many international students working in the high-tech fields, the US can't make such a success in the world. These students are highly educated, and can contribute to the America. So if there are less opportunities for them here, then they will go somewhere else. This is like using American educational resources to make other countries better and make itself worse.
