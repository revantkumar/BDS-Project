I'm a foreign STEM student working in Pure Storage.Inc. More than half of the employee in my company are foreign students and many teams consist pretty much with foreign STEM former students. If they do not get a working visa, countless high tech company like Pure Storage will collapse over night. This is something nobody would want to see.
Also the vast amount of foreign tech workers simply demonstrate there is such need of high tech talent. The argument that these foreign students are "stealing" jobs from american citizen is absurd and laughable:company will most definitely inclined to hire citizen provided they are qualified, simply because this avoids the sponsorship of H1B for a foreign student graduate employee. Those who made the complaint are those incompetent and black sheeping the STEM students.
We are who devoting our youth to build america, and this proposal will surely be beneficial to this country.
