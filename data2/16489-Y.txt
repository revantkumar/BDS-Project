I understand that there are opposing voices towards OPT extension, but for the long run, I believe this proposal is greatly beneficial to the country.

Economically: Doubtlessly, STEM students bring significant income to the colleges, which helps lessen universities' financial debt, therefore lowers average educational cost for local students. Although many other countries are trying to attract foreign students to their colleges, US has been the first choice for the STEM students because of the promising job market and flexible visa policy like OPT extension.

Job market: Overall job market is getting better recently.High tech companies are actually actively recruiting, I know it because I am also an active job seeker. Companies are realistic. They want smart brains, regardless of nationality. Unemployment is because of economy, foreigners are not who to blame. 

Diversity: Diversity is one of the most important characteristic to make the US as strong as it is today. Like diet, we cannot live solely with protein, nor can we solely with carb. US has been doing so well. Keep going.
