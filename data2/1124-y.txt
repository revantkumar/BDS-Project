Yinshen Tang This rule is going to bring so many benefits to US universities, tech industry and foreign students.

When I first decided to study aboard, one of the top reason I choose US over other countries is because of OPT and OPT extension which give me over 2 years of time acquire valuable working experience in the industry. And the work I'm doing requires two to three years to actually contribute to large projects and making some actual achievements. Without this industry experience, my study in US is not a complete package.

For the tech industry, OPT extension provides lots of highly skilled workforce to help its growth. There's always more demand than supply of engineer. Without OPT and OPT extension, silicon valley alone will lose tens of thousands of brilliant engineers. Even the very best tech companies could stop been productive overnight.

STEM students needs the opportunity to work for the best tech companies in the world. And most of those companies are in US. Meanwhile, US need highly skilled and well educated workforce. And STEM student is the best source for that.
