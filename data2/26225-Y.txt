I strongly agree with improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees for the reasons following:
1. It is beneficial for the American worldwide eclectic and inclusive reputation. It is an opportunity for the country to show the style of a great nation.
2. It is beneficial for the American economy due to the absorption and accumulation of versatile and varied elites. For example, Singapore is carrying out an educational program in which the government provides financial support for foreign students to complete the undergraduate and even graduate study; however, these students are required to work in Singapore for at least ten years.
