I was a Chinese student and just graduated. Now I am working in a very nice company and I am very satisfied with my job. I like the way people deal with business and relationship. I feel like the United States is a perfect place to work to make one's dream come true. As long as I work hard, I can have the life I want. Thus I hope this new OPT Extension Policy can be justified so that I will have more possibilities to benefit my company. I know the United States needs people like me to work on technology and engineering. I am pretty sure that this new policy is a very right decision because this is a double-win policy. The United States should be open and welcome to all intelligent people as always. Only in this way, can the US keep moving and developing.
