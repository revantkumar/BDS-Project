Dear Sirs,

Americans should be your top priority. Allowing immigrants to be hired over able-bodied and capable Americans is unjust and should be illegal. Our people come first when it comes to our jobs. They are not yours to dispense as you see fit. Non working Americans cannot contribute to society and to social security. Unemployed Americans hurt the very fabric of our society. Bringing in others to fill jobs that Americans are capable of filling is unconscionable. Keep Americans working and keep America moving forward. 

Sincerely,
Lucinda Schaefer
