I support the proposal for the following reasons.
1. I am a STEM major student, most of my America classmates could find their dream jobs more easier than those international students. So I do not think foreigners rob job opportunities from American if they are in the same skills level.
2. We see that foreign employees have great contribution to the technology industry. They make money for companies and promote economic of America. 
3. Diversity is one of the most important principle that pioneers establish the United States. This is not only about job opportunities but the spirit of America.
