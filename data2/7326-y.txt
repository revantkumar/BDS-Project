Parikshit Bhattacharjee I strongly support the 24 month OPT STEM extension. Here are my reasons for the support:
1. There is a shortage of qualified people for STEM related jobs in the US. Students who graduate from US universities are qualified to meet this demand. 
2. Companies don't pay OPT students less than American employees. Salaries are mostly based on merit, skills and experience. So the argument that OPT provides cheap labor is completely unfounded. 
3. OPT students staying longer in the US has a positive impact on the US economy because they spend a substantial portion of their income on housing, retail and entertainment.
4. If the STEM extension is not implemented, many international students will no longer see the US as an attractive destination for their graduate studies. This will in turn negatively impact the diverse student bodies most US universities currently have, 
5.This extension gives a fair chance to students to compete and find a job. International students work hard and retain the jobs because they have too much at stake. They have proven to be great workers and an asset to many companies all across the US.
