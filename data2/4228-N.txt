I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's rule that would expand the optional practical training program. Tech companies should hire American college students instead of foreign ones. We need to expand programs that allow American citizens to increase their opportunities. Young people today are already saddled with high college debts and problems finding jobs when they do finish college.
