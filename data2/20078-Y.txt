What is America? What is American dream? When your fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers came to America and thrived here via hard working, how come you forget about all these?

Let's give what these hard-working international students who have their American dreams what they deserve, and also give those companies who want to employ whoever fit them a change that they deserve!

This is not about rewarding or punishing someone; this is about being fair and let what they deserve!

I TOTALLY SUPPORT IT!
