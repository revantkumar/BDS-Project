I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. We all know that the U.S. is experiencing a period of economic recovery and needs all kinds of talents in the area of STEM. However, the supply of local students is scarce and the they are not suitable to some jobs to some extend compared with the foreign people, especially from the Asian countries. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S to develop a new strong and competitive country. For example, due to the diversity of people in most big companies, they can develop the business well to other countries.

3. With the relationship betweem China and the U.S developing well, especially the frequent contact between the leaders, we have established a fixed relationship with Americans and the new policy will strengthen the relationship to form a win-win situation.
