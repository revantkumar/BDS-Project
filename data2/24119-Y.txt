I am a current STEM student on my OPT period, this is really great news for me because I am currently working for an awesome company on a job I am very interested in. I totally reply on my OPT to keep my working status, otherwise, I cannot go under my career path as planned. I known many coworkers and friends who are in the same situation as me, we are thrilled to see this extension proposal and we benefit a lot from it!!! I also believe, it will increase future students to seek education is STEM from US and bring their knowledge back to US, this is really a win-win policy! I cannot wait to see this proposal become final soon.
