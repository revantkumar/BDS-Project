I came to the United State appreciating the "American Dream", dreaming I could devote tons of efforts, but never realized it's growing into the terrible notion to build this once wonderland into a dungeon where people gather together celebrating seclusion and prioritizing themselves. Please help the "Einstein"s survive, we are here to contribute, not to wrestle with the opportunities, which are plenty out there and deserve the striving work of all of us, be it the citizens or not. And THAT is the essence of this charming country would stand on the Earth.
