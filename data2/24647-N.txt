What is the purpose of this rule? To bring in more people who can work for one particular employer but not be able to change jobs? No rights whatsoever...21st century Jim Crow? If we need skilled folks, provide a route to permanent residency. There are only a limited number of green cards, but the number of temporary work permits is being increased without any regard to the number of green cards. Is this being done at the behest of a few corporations or vested interests, who profit from indentured laborers? Again, if the US economy really needs people, offer a path to permanent residency, rather than temporary work visas. Temporary work permits only benefit those who want to profiteer using cheap labor (especially when paying social security and medicare is not mandatory). Government agencies should work for the benefit of all, not just for lobbyists and exploiters. 
Immigration isn't about bringing people in this country and denying them basic rights (like being able to live free and change jobs).
