Anna Lin As a F1 student, I strongly SUPPORT OPT EXTENSION because it is only a basic right for the international students to have a better chance of working in the US to pursue their dreams. Also, I do not believe it will do that much harm to the US citizens since hunting is a fair competition, not to mention that the US citizens already have a lot of priorities and more choices in this. All in all, I sincerely hope that the US government will have a broader and longer vision and attract more and more talents worldwide to contribute to the economy of this country.
