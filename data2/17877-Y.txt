I'm a 5th year PhD student in computer science studying in America. I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

A big factor makes America has the most advantaged technology in the world is that it attracts a lot of talented students worldwide to American universities by offering high-quality program. These internationals students, especially graduate student, have made significant contributions to the development in STEM fields, which are the fundamentals to develop technologies which lead to applications, products and growth the economy in this country. 

There is some gap between the knowledge and skills gained from class and those needs to be used in the industry. Applying these knowledge and skills from classroom to industry and adapting industry both take time. That's what OPT and its extension for. To provide a practical training for foreign students for 3 years would let them again industry experiences so they are more competitive when returning to their country. They also could applied what they have learned in school to contribute to the company to US.

Allowing foreign students to gain a few years of working experience after graduating is a big attraction to foreign students over educational program of other countries. Shortening this time would make US universities much less appealing to foreign students. That will cause fewer talents to study in US. We all know diversity is a big reason makes this country great. Loss in diversity in STEM majors will definitely cause the decrease and slowdown of the development of science and technology in this country, which would cause slowdown of economy and job losses at much larger scale.
