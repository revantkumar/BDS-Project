I am extremely confused as to why our federal government would create much less expand the OPT program. We are paying American employers to hire foreign workers at subpar pay that do not pay into our social safety net? Millions of highly educated Americans have been replaced by these immigrant workers that have to be mentored in how to do their jobs for what purpose? Please explain the logic behind these decisions and kindly support your assertions with verifiable data. How have we benefited this great nation by importing less educated and less prepared workers with this program? it is no secret that our economy is in shambles and our middle class is quickly dissipating,how has this program helped to alleviate theses problems? Do we have a long and short term goal for eliminating these programs and restoring these jobs to American workers? What is that plan and who is entrusted with implementing it. Who has been tasked with formulating a way to restore the rightful American workers to the jobs which should belong to American workers who pay in to social security and medicare? Have there been any detailed analysis of what impact this program has on our social security and medicare systems? Why are we considering expanding the OPT program without first justifying the expansion by demonstrating how this program has benefited our nation? Please respond in full to these inquiries. Thank you for your consideration.
