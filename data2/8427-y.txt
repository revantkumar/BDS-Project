Rui Sun I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 
First of all the extension rule will help the U.S. to attract more international students, which means it will also attract more talents for the country. STEM students contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.
Secondly, international students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States.
Thirdly, the extension rule will do no harm to the native employment, because most international students plan to go back to their home country after few years of working in the U.S., they just want to gain more experience.
