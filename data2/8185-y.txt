Cynthia Wang I strongly support the OPT_extension.
As a Chinese international student who is taking the undergraduate education in UK, I intend to take the post-graduate courses in US in next year. The reason that I don't want to continue to study in UK is that it is very difficult to get the post-study workPSW) visa in UK. As UK cancel PSW for international student in 2012, we cannot get enough time to find jobs after graduation from bachelor or even master degrees, which means that we cannot obtain the practice experience in industry in UK. Working experience is one of the essential points when I consider the country to study and for my parents investing my education. Moreover, not just me, more and more friends I know are planing to continue further study in US owing to the OPT-extension could offer the time for international students to get a job for improving the working skills, which will benefits to further developments when we back to China.
