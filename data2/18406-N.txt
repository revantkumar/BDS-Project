The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.

I am unable to find anything in this proposed rule which would be beneficial to American workers or students. For example, will you please explain why these foreign students are allowed to earn large salaries, yet be exempt from Social Security taxes? Why are these students given preferential treatment over often better qualified American students? An explanation of how this rule is in any way fair to Americans?
