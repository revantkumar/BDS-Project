The Practical Training Program is an additional reason for American students to shy away from science and technology; exactly the areas we want young people to pursue. By making it easy for companies to hire cheap foreign interns without the burden of taxes and social security, American students will have a tougher time finding work while in school. I strongly oppose programs that allow companies to avoid paying fair wages and allow foreign workers to take advantage of our country without funding it.
