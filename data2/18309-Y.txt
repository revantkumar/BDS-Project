I strongly support this proposal. There are tons of benefits if this ruling is passed. As a country that was founded on immigration, all the quality talents were and has been the main reasons that the U.S developed to the most dominant country in the globe, economically and politically. Some opponents were saying this will steal jobs from the natives. (Here I'm talking about the highly sophisticated jobs which need high level of special skills in stead of cheap labor manufacture level jobs) However, if you take a look at the opportunities for international students, there are not that many to start with. So stealing is even ridiculous. Most of the time, it's extra difficulty for highly skilled foreign workers to get a job. If they do beat out other candidates and win the competition among other Americans, it is all because they are more qualified than other candidates. Bottom line, the U.S market is absorbing the best of the best talents from this ruling. In return, they make great contribution to the U.S society. This actually positively increases the competition which increase people's to competitiveness. It is a wonderful virtuous cycle to stimulate the economy growth in the U.S.
