You will notice that the vast majority of positive comments are from OPT beneficiaries. If this were a true attempt to see the real impact of this change, there would be far more comments from impacted citizens here. This is nothing more than a blatant giveaway to industry. It will do nothing to encourage students in this country to go into STEM careers and indeed will damage this effort. Say goodbye to an America as a scientific and technical leader. Another generation suffering programs like this will pretty much do it - I know I have steered my daughter (junior in college) and my son (senior in high school) away from STEM careers even though they have aptitude and are in the top 0.5% in the country in their class. So sad.
