Diana Honerkamp With all due respect, I approve of STEM OPT. It is both necessary and positive to not only the participants, but to U.S residents and citizens as well. The loss of STEM OPT would inflict great grief and hardships to participants, employers, and loved ones. This program is essential for U.S progress in STEM fields. I fully support STEM OPT and it's endeavors.
