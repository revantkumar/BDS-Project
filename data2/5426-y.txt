Xingang Li I strongly support this rule regarding the OPT STEM extension. 

This rule is important to keep the talented students in America to contribute to the economy and maintain the leading role of USA in technology. Furthermore, the rule will also attract more international students coming to study in America. This will significantly promote the local economy and create tons of jobs for americans. 

This rule is important for both Americans and students. Please approve it as soon as possible.
