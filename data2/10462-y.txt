Wendy Guo I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reason:
America become the richest country because of America always offers protections to international scholars and pioneers in different fields, such as Albert Einstein. There is no boundary for knowledge or industry innovations. Offering protection to U.S. citizens to avoid competition seems to be unwise and not fair which greatly violate America's spirits. Only competition, communication and comparison would stimulate development in both nature world and human society. As a international student, I would like to stay in US. during OPT time for top level industry experience in those top companies. America lose nothing to give 24 months to international students, but America get cheap labor from those youth with full of enthusiastic and innovations. 
Offering more training time and more chance to international students for equality, development and economic benefits. So, there is no reason to stop OPT extension.
