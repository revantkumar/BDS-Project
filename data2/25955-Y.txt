I highly support this rule! Skilled immigrants provide diversity and innovation to the workspace. It is known that there is shortage of stem workers in the US, and many tech companies are in need of talented and skilled stem graduates to take on the jobs. At the company I am working for, stem students are being put on projects that require complex analysis and excellent programming skills, and our economy is benefiting from the contribution of stem students. In short, students graduated with a degree from US high education are the most reliable and capable force to fill in those stem jobs for the prosperity of our economy .
