Xingxing Wang I think the OPT for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees should be extended. Following are reasons: 1) The economy of America is driven mostly by technology, and F-1 students with STEM degrees can contribute a lot to America's technological development. 2) F-1 students gain valuable knowledge from US universities, to extend the F-1 training OPT can let them have more opportunities to give back to US society, by bringing values through hard work during training time.
