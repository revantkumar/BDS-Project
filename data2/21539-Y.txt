I've read opposed comments but find them in lack of proof.They say "OPT places foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market competition",but the truth is, most of F1 students who use OPT to stay in USA are the top genius ones from every country, they not only compete only in the top field(which will not influence to average Americans) but also have the potential to create a great amount of job opportunities .There're never TOO many best competitors in society, you have to take the fact that F1 students are quite different from illegal labor workers into condition,it could be a CRIME if you cut a gifted, hardworking young man's chance to becoming great , not to mention that he surely will help with US's economic growth.

If people do not try the best to improve skill set but to blame those F1 students for taking their jobs, I do not see any hope in this country.Don't forget that United States rose as a result of a immigration culture.
