This is a real problem for American workers.
I was just laid off from a big government contractor(UHGTricare)because I was a White American expecting to be payed the market wages as an IT professional. This contractor only hires foreign nationals because they work for below market wages. Older American workers are displaced because the age of the worker Younger is cheaper. See Norms work at this link.
Norm is a former Dem congressman from Calf. Please ask him to speak at any committee meetings

As for the need for more STEM workers, That's a fallacy to: my son just graduated for a good STEM school in Electrical Engineering and could not find a job for over 2 years. If you look in the MplsSt. Paul area's Jobs sections on line. You will not find an entry level Electrical Engineering job posted, they all require 3-4 years experience which is impossible to get with out those entry level jobs. He was forced to take a job at $16.00 an hour, and now is having problems paying his loans off. It's time to think about American's first.
