It has been proven that we do not have a STEM skill shortage I do not agree that the U.S. should expand this program. The tech companies have already fired thousands of American employees in order to hire foreign citizens and foreign students and the companies have announced layoffs of 11,000 Americans in the coming year in anticipation of hiring foreign students to replace them. 

The companies are able to pay the foreign citizens and students much less than Americans and, the companies are given the very large incentive (about $11,000 per worker) of not having to pay Social Security on these hires (nor will the foreign hires have to pay into Social Security). 

My understanding of these programs is that the foreign students were to return to their own countries to enable their countries to progress. Instead we are seeing American companies draining the foreign countries of the talent they need to progress. I believe they did the same thing with medical doctors in the late 1990s which has led to a serious shortage of medical doctors today. 

President Obama's administration has admitted that the main purpose of the expanded OPT is to give more foreign workers time to transition into longer-term H-1B workers and permanent employment visas, deliberately and maliciously undercutting American citizen students and full time employees. 

It is immoral that our government would seek to deliberately undercut our own citizens at the behest of any big sector of our business community. 

Any immigration policy should serve the interest of ordinary American citizens, not just the very rich!
