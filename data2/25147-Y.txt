I believe that both foreign and native STEM students get same pay. And companies consider both foreign and native STEM students equally. Companies hire hard-workers with stronger academic background. If our U.S. STEM cannot find a job, we should not blame others. We need to improve ourselves! Take Boeing as an example. Foreign mechanical engineers are not allowed to work at Boeing. But not all U.S. mechanical engineers can work at Boeing. The reason is that, considering professional ability, not all mechanical engineers are qualified to work at Boeing. Even if we do not keep foreign STEM students at US, those US STEM students who cannot find a job still cannot get a job. So please stop blaming foreign STEM students! We should improve ourselves. And we should keep these STEM students at US to keep improving our innovation ability. I totally support this rule without doubt!
