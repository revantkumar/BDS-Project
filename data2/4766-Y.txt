I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I'm feasible contributing to Innovation and American Economy. I appreciate and support the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule for 24 months. 

As an International student and STEM graduate, I would like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
