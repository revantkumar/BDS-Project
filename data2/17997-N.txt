These "regulations" are why American citizens don't trust the government! We don't even know what's going on with OUR government.

I hold a degree in Information Technology and I am a veteran. I can't find a job. Even when you do it is a temporary job. We spend a lot of money on education and can't find jobs to pay back student loans.

I have never heard of a "training" program that takes 24-months. And why is this program only afforded to foreign workers? According to Homeland Security we need foreign workers to compete...no we don't. America is the greatest country because AMERICANS are great. Other countries look up to us not the other way around.

It is my understanding that e-verify does not even work. There are hundreds of thousands of foreigners that have overstayed their h-1 visas. Why should we flood the job market with more? And these people don't contribute to the Social Security fund. I can't see any good coming out of this policy. It is only benefiting the corporations that use this free labor.

I don't remember Obama campaigning for more foreign workers...he said he was fighting for the middle class-what a bunch of crock! Just like the immigration reform bill this proposal is terrible for American workers. If I remember Americans did not want immigration reform. Why is this administration trying to make policy behind our back?

This is why the middle class is dwindling...back deals and back door policy. Thank goodness for the internet...nice try but WE CAUGHT YOU.
