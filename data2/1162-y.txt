Zhuojun Bai I strongly support this rule, not just because it will help STEM students, but also this policy will have a strong and positive effects on the development of US.

First of all, let's think why we emphasize STEM education and why we provide 19-month extension to F-1 non-immigrant students. The reason is that STEM is vital to our future. According to the U. S. Department of Commerce, STEM occupations are growing at 17%, while others are growing at 9.8%. It's obvious to know that we need STEM employees.

The next question is how we could get talented STEM employees. The answer is fare competition. If you are qualified, then you can be employed. The fact is that a lot of STEM students or employees have been working so hard and working so great to prove that they are qualified. So, why don't we give them the chance? why don't we give US a change to let them stay here? 

On the other side, this policy will also motivate US students to compete with others, which will can help STEM become more developed.
