As one of most common international students in America universities, realizing my own dream of being a software engineering is my goal after graduate from university. I am a student, a member of Department of CSE in UCSD, we pursue higher level of education in United States, like many other indian students in here. And that's why we are here.

Education in USA give not only international students more opportunities to chase their dreams, it also make this country competitive in the world. Most international students, like me, choose to stay in Unites States after they graduate. Since standing in a wider place, we can free from short-sighting. With comfortable environment offered by big companies like Google and Microsoft, we can more easily devote ourselves into our work. And we will make differences, our contribution not only lies in the increasing of employment rate, but also in high-tech fields such as computer science and electrical engineering. It is common to find a Indian or Chinese in a Qualcomm, a big company in San Diego, California.
