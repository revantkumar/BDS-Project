Wherever talents go, jobs follow with them.

As a tech worker I cannot agree more with the proposed rule. The prosperity of US tech job market is driven by contributors and consumers both inside and outside the US. Being exceptionally open to talents and innovation, the US is the global hub of tech industry. Silicon Valley is the place for people regardless of nationality to pursue their dreams, contribute to great companies like Google, Apple and Facebook, and sell their products to their home countries. This ecosystem is invaluable, for it attracts global wealth and jobs within US border, bringing tech jobs closer to American tech workers.

If talents go to somewhere else, so does our prestigious market share in the global tech industry. The job positions are also lost with them. They will build great companies, sell their products, and pay tax in their home countries. Everything will be irrelevant to the US. Even worse, some of these companies will go back to the US market and take consumers and profit away from US companies.

We cannot let this happen. That's why STEM visa must be fixed.
