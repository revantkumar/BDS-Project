I strongly support this new OPT policy because it is really a win-win strategy for both US and foreign STEM students. 

I saw the most concern from those people who left negative comments is that they are afraid of losing jobs because of the those students. That is NOT TRUE at all. 
First, not all companies will hire international students; 
Second, the companies, who are willing to hire international students, only take the qualifications into consideration. To be honest, sometimes even those companies prefer people with citizenships over those who are not if they have the similar background. So STEM students are not in advantageous situations. 

On the other hand, we should realize that the competition can push our citizens to improve themselves and can give our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. That is one reason why US becomes one of the most powerful country in the world. 

Thank you for the consideration.
