I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.

I works in a express mail company. From my recent years I found our business makes great improvement and the shipping from China to the US now is improving extremely fast. I have came across some customers. They told me that US OPT program is very attractive so they choose to study in the US. I think this rule will definitely improve US economics in every corner.

A lot of people may have concern in job competition but I don't think it is a problem. From my past experience, jobs' priority will always be citizens and this rule also have many restrictions on salaries.
