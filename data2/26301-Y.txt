Although I'm a social science and humanity major, this piece of legislation do makes sense. It is important for the United States to end this 200-year "immigration or xenophobia" dilemma.Obviously, more visas more US- educated intelligent labor force, which might make a great difference to the reality of American economy. So what else except jobs are you afraid of? Intermarriage? Religion? Communism? So 19th century!
