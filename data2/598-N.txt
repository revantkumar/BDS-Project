There's quite a lot we could say about this particular subject, but instead, we will try to keep it short and to the point - such as:

- OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
- OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
- OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.
- the proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination."
- The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.
- this entire course of action from the government is to MAKE SURE ONLY foreign students get government help, while American students get NONE (which is TOTALLY unconstitutional) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is, as usual from this Administration, a lie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
