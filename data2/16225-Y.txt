The advantage of STEM OPT extension outweighs the disadvantage. 

1. Why OPT is needed?
To attract the international talents to the United States is almost guaranteed a crucial contributing factor to the economy of the United States. When deciding where to pursue the advanced/higher education, the OPT (and OPT STEM) opportunity plays a key role to a lot of international students. I studied in a top-3 college in China for my undergraduate, majoring in mathematics. Over 90% of my classmates who chose to study abroad came to United States. In addition to the excellent academic resources, the opportunity to study and practice with OPT is a very strong advantage for the United States over the European countries, even if European universities provide more available scholarship chances for graduate studies. 

2. Why STEM extension is needed?
The length of OPT program actually determines the effect of the practice training. For research and development divisions, where most STEM students work, 12 months is essentially too short to output any impactful product/service to the United States. To extend the OPT duration for the international student who are in STEM is to help the company to achieve more and make more contribution to the economy of the United States, and help the STEM students to grow himself/herself more in terms of skills and knowledge.

3. Future influences
The economy of United States actually is not an isolated economy. It goes accordance with the economy of the whole world. Big players in technology, such as Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, are actively attempting to enter the Asian market further. If the STEM students are able to get enough experience in the United States with OPT and OPT extension, it will eventually benefit these companies when the students decide to go back and work for their own countries. Their valuable experience working in the United States will finally benefit the United States' economy.
