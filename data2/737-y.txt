R Wang I strongly Support this 24 Months OPT STEM EXTENSION Rule. For the following reason:

1) OPT and OPT STEM EXTENSION is A Necessary Program to Keep Talents in the US.
OPT and OPT STEM EXTENSION Program is not only an opportunity for students with US degree to practice what they have learn in school, it is also an opportunity for companies to choose qualified students and continue to offer them work visa sponsorship. In such way, talented student can be kept in the US and continue to serve the US economic.

2) Creativity from Students help Creating Jobs.
STEM Students are proven to one of the most hard working and creative employee groups in the US. These creativities will lead to new ideas, new technologies, and new inventions, which has the potential of creating even more jobs than what the students are taken now. Revoking the work privilege of students might save some jobs for current citizens and permanent immigrants temporarily, but it eliminates the possibility of ideas to be created by STEM Students in this country, which will further cause new jobs be created slower or even not created. 

3) Diversified Cultural Background and Global Business Relationships.
Global business relationship requires constant maintenance and development. Students from other countries possess different cultural backgrounds, which will facilitate the US maintaining current global business interest and develop new ones.

4) Job Opportunity Should be Fair for Everyone.
Job opportunity is essentially a trade between labor and salary. For the history of United States and many European Countries, "Fair Trade" has been the one of the most important part of the economical system. For most of the time, "Protectionism" is what policy makers usually vote against to. Cancelling OPT STEM EXTENSION is a type of Protectionism, which will cause the job opportunity being trade unfairly between students and current citizens or permanent residents.
