The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.

Why would the Department of Homeland Security use my tax money to show favoritism to foreign students over hard working taxpaying United States citizens. Our students graduate and have a hard time finding work in their given fields, yet OPT will pay companies who 'gift' foreign students. It is time to rethink how damaging this rule will be.
