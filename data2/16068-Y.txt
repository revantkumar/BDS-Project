I SUPPORT the proposal for following reasons:
Two years of OPT do bring more competition to native people. But competition brings progress. The importance of competition is obvious. A world without competition is lacking of power of development. Nonimmigrant student who could find a job in US are always the best student in their country. They bring good quality here, which could help native people find their weaknesses. This could help both side do have the strength to develop themselves and do better in future career. 

OPT is not H1B. Students have the chance of spend their OPT doesnt mean they can gain a H1B visa. H1B may leads to immigration, but the number of H1B is also limited. Additionally, most of the H1B is given to professional experienced worker rather than nonimmigrant student. So I dont think reduce OPT time will help reduce number of immigration because it doesnt limit H1B. It will only bring a country with a large amount of lazy people.

Nonimmigrant students spend A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY in US to obtain good education and working experience. They have the right to learn what they need after they leave because they pay for it. One year of OPT is too short for them to gain basic working experience. Most of the nonimmigrant students will return their home country after they complete their study. So I dont think they will harm native workers profit.
