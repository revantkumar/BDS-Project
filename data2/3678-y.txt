Goutham Samanthula I support this rule 100%. 

I have been going over some comments on this rule and I think most of the comments against this rule are baseless. There is an assumption that any rule related to immigration which provides a legal way to stay a little longer in the US is being interpreted as hostile against the jobs for Americans.

The statistics on the revenue generated is a proof that we need international students to study in the US. I really appreciate the idea that the international students be given the opportunity to apply the education in real life. While this is important, it would not be worthy if the students cannot repay the loans back in their home country. There will be no point in coming to the US to get an education when a student is not given the opportunity to earn and repay the loan. Without this rule, just the financial burden itself will be a big de-motivating factor for students to study in the US. This rule will have a positive effect on the number of students considering coming to the US for their education 

I really appreciate DHS in making this new rule in favor of the International Student Community.
