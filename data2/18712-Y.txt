I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to American.
2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S, a lot students make a big different in USA.
3. By having international student students to contribute their knowledge American could improve in more aspect.
