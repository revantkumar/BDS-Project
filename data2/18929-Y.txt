I strongly support this rule!

If you cancelled this rule, I am sure this will result less and less international students will come to U.S for further education!

Everyone knows since more and more international students come to U.S for further education, they attribute a large parts of economy for U.S, especially these who pay the tuition by themselves! If OPT rule was cancelled, less students will consider to come to U.S for further education.

Lots of students come to U.S not only for the U.S best further education but also for U.S can supply equal opportunities for them to practice their acknowledge they learned from the U.S college. Since they had strongly education background and self-strict qualities, they also attribute economy for U.S!

They use their professional technology help U.S people live more comfortable, pay the tax to this country!
