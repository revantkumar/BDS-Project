apoorva sri I strongly support the STEM Extension and I believe it's the right step moving forward. 

Ultimately the highly skilled F-1 students (Masters/PHD) contribute to the US Economy in a positive way. This is a fact. Many of the students end up starting companies of their own which leads to more jobs in the STEM sector. There must be a fair and healthy competition among eligible students (both citizens and International students) for high skill positions and having this 24 month extension gives everyone a fair and equal chance.

Most students take the chance of leaving their home country for education here due to the job opportunities. If the extension is removed, the chances of getting a job diminish significantly. This will simply lead to students not coming to the US for study and would affect various universities that rely on large tuition collection from foreign nationals causing them to lose a major source of revenue.

I do however have a concern regarding the proposed rule. According to the rule the Training and Mentorship Program seems to add additional burden on the Employer and DSO. Employers might hesitate to hire a student who needs the STEM extension, considering the amount of time and effort needed to fill and maintain all the paperwork. In my opinion, having to prove that the student is currently employed in a field related to the degree obtained and not causing any citizens to lose their jobs should suffice.
