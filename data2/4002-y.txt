Manda Lorry It is badly vital to extend the OPT. Firstly, it makes much more senior labour flow into the United States. If not, the labor capital, including factories and farms, will continue to outflow then lead to reduce wages. Secondly, extend the OPT will bring more employment opportunities for various open work, rather than the industy with limeted chances. Therefore, in the long run, for a open economies as the United States, extend the OPT not only increase a large number of high-quality labor capital, but also provides a large number of high-quality talent. Suppose not to extend the OPT helps to enhance the level of wages, then the high salary level will mean that American consumers need to withstand higher prices. Thus, the whole country, especially for those low-income consumers shopping at wal-mart (these consumers benefit more from cheap goods) - will be aggrieved. So, I support for extending the OPT!
