As a Professor of English at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, recently recognized as among the most diversified campus in the United States, I strongly support the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. It is of the utmost importance that we extend to these students, many of whom I teach, every opportunity to succeed in the United States--and to remain in the United States to make countless kinds of contributions to the American work force.

Thank you for your consideration.

Cordially,

William Hutchings
