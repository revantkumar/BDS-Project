A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand: 1) OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; 2) OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
This is NOT helping Americans!!!! Our nation is being destroyed by those who hate us and if the USA falls so goes the rest of the world.
