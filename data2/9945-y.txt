Aravindan Rajamani I want the STEM Extension rule because of the following reasons:

1 The initial 12 month OPT period, is not enough to completely apply the concepts learned through our education. As most of the companies have a training program on their own, on an average 3-4 months go in training. The rest 8 months is not enough for us to apply those concepts.

2 Companies are investing a lot on the international students during the initial period of the hire, as they know according the current rule these students will work for them for at least 29 months (12+17 months)

3 Companies will not be ready to hire international students with just 12 months of OPT, as they will not be benefited by having a short term employee. 

As per the existing rule and the new rule, its a WIN WIN situation for both the companies and the student. Thus I strongly feel that the new extension rule must be implemented as it has benefits for the student, company and also the US economy.
