Thanks for the proposal. This would definitlely help the students to gain more proctical training thereby use the skills they developed during the course. More practical training period means more contribution to employer and economy and hence this is definitely good for both sides.

The new proposal is better than the previous STEM extension. Thanks for the modifications.
