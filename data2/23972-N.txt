I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. 

It is absolutely ridiculous that the federal government is trying to expand these types of programs. Do we Americans have a government that represents us? why was i not asked about expanding this program?
