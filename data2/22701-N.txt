I have been in the high tech arena for all of my career. I personally think your proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of American STEM graduates recently finishing college. There is also no shortage of STEM degree holders who are citizens. Most of the companies asking for more visas are simply engaging in Econ 101 which in part as we all know shows if one can manipulate the flow of labor through immigration policies, one can control wages for the most part. Expanding the OPT program is also a trick to maneuver around H-1B visa limits. We should be lowering the number of high tech visas, instead of attacking America's middle class using immigration policies as a weapon. Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor supply for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands and in effect hurt American workers and affect their wages if they are lucky enough to get a high tech job. OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers and hire a non-citizen. Because OPT workers are students as such, employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these student employees. That alone would save thousands a year every year as companies employ people in the OPT program. Why doesn't our federal government do something that makes sense for a change........look out for American workers and those citizens entering the job market. Take action that is in the interest of citizens, not special interests and those wanting to manipulate our immigration system for greed at the expense of citizens.
