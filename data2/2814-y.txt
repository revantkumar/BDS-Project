Sam Xie I strongly support the extension of OPT for several reasons:

1. Every year, large numbers of foreign students fly to the US and come to study in universities, including top universities like Harvard, Duke, Chicago, UMich, UCBerkley, UCLA, CMU, MIT... These students are among the top-level ones that is doomed to make difference in America. If they are not offered proper opportunities to find a job here, the US will lose a great amount of talents.

2. STEM related companies will lose a lot of labor force, especially those who have enjoyed top formal education. Thus, companies revenues are going to decrease.
