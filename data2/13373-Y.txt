I strongly OPPOSE this extension of the OPT program.
Also, I can't help but notice that the majority of the PRO comments seem to be from people on F-1 visas or others who have no legal or moral right to influence your decision on this matter. The only opinions you should consider are those of Americans.
Here are some of the reasons I oppose this extension:
- A person with a Bachelors degree, or higher, does not NEED training! They've had their training already, and only need to adapt themselves to the work environment of the company that hires them. An F-1 student should be encouraged to leave the country upon graduation while their skills are still fresh and they can do the most good for their home country.
- American STEM graduates can't find jobs in STEM fields. Why? Because companies do not have to pay SocSec and Medicare taxes for OPT employees. This translates to a defacto subsidy for employers who hire OPT workers. Thus, it is easier for an OPT student to find a job in his or her chosen field than it is for a native born American.
- There is no shortage of STEM workers in America. I have been involved in IT since the late 1970's and I can state that there never was a shortage. There is, in fact, a surplus of qualified Americans who are willing and able to do these jobs. If there was a true shortage, wages would be rising in the STEM fields at a rate higher than that found in other fields. That simply is not happening. Why? Because the government has made it easy for companies to bring in foreign workers at a lower cost. It has also allowed companies to hire fresh employees with the latest skills rather than train existing employees. If you are of the opinion that older STEM workers just can't learn the new technologies, I ask you to look at the ages of those who actually 'developed' these new technologies. You will find that many were over 40.
- Lastly, STEM workers have a double job. We have to be effective with current technology while also devoting time an
