The 24 months OPT extension should definitely be supported.

1. From students perspective, they are all willing to apply what they've learned into practice. In such a prospective STEM 'market' in US, I believe it's easier for students to get the maximum out of them 

2. From government side, this policy will definitely encourage more international students/scholars to come to study and live in US. On the contrary, cancellation of this policy will let them down to some what. Foe those of who have got H1B and green card, they might even get nervous since they cannot see supports from government to international students/immigrants.
