I strongly support this proposed rule for F-1 students. This is a rule that will benefit the economy of the U.S and promote healthy technology innovation. 

For those who claim the foreign students are taking their jobs, it is simply the opposite. The foreign students are helping creating opportunities. The growth of job market relies on the emergence of new technologies, the new graduates with talented brains and natural curiosity is the source of innovation. 

When employers look for candidates, they hire the ones that they believe will create values for their company, no matter it is US citizen or foreigners. If someone claims foreigner are taking their jobs, it's not the truth, it's the employers' natural choice. Even if there is no foreigners, the employers will still hire the ones that will make significant contributions.

The presence of foreign students promote healthy competition which is critical to the healthy growth of economy. The truth is, if there is no competition, there is no drive for improvement and thus no technology advance. 

The reason US stays the front of innovation is because US is a country which gives equal opportunity. As long as you have the skills and talent, you will have a chance to turn your ideas into reality and thus benefit the society.
