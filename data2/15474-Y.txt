This provision allows skilled professionals to pursue work opportunities in the United States that are securely purely on merit and hard work. Preventing nonimmigrant students will very badly cripple the performance and development of the numerous STEM employers in the country. It will be a violation of the nonimmigrant students who are denied work/deported and uprooted from their existing professional and social setup. Expanding training opportunities can help towards mutual growth and appropriate appreciation of merit and effort.
