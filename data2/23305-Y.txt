It is very difficult for an international student to find training opportunities, and this proposal will give a chance to those to apply training while contributing to the US economy at the same time.

It would be completely devastating for the thousands of employers if this rule is not passed. There would be such a huge loss to these companies because they couldnt find qualified STEM students. 

The number of IT jobs are increasing exponentially and there simply arent enough qualified workers. DHS needs to pass this rule to help the students apply training and help the economy grow.
