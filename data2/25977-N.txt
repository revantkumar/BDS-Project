How dare you expand Visas to foreigners/students when Americans cannot find jobs? Did you read Disney is replacing US workers for foreigners partly because of Visas like this? Do you guys want to multiply that?? It seems like you want all Americans to be on welfare, and provide the few jobs available to foreign workers. As a naturalized US citizen I am appalled that you guys are thinking of doing this to native born Americans, and naturalized citizens like myself.
