Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am Prasad Chaudhari, a graduate student at University of Cincinnati and almost 60% of Cincinnati graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. We will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
OPT extension is important to me because it will allow me to stay in USA for longer period of time to achieve the much needed technical expertise.

Best regards,
Prasad Chaudhari
