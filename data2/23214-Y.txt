I strongly support the new STEM extension plan. The technology industry is the most important industry for the U.S. It is also the key for the U.S. to sustain strong in the future. Executing this program will only bring benefits to the U.S. So many people argue that foreigners steal jobs from Americans. But we need to think about what kind of future we are looking for. Perhaps people expect that everyone is employed and the U.S. will be the greatest country in the world. But that is not gonna happen at all. The U.S. needs innovations. Attracting more foreign nationals who work in hi-tech field is highly beneficial to the U.S. economy. Now the U.S. no longer has advantages in manufacturing but the U.S. has a huge lead in technological inventions. Clearly, there is a big shortage of STEM workers in the U.S. Google, facebook, and so on have constantly asked for leniency in foreigner work authorizations. Human capital is the key for more development and competency for U.S. economy and relying on only U.S. citizens is simply not enough. It is crucial to attract talents all over the world to the U.S. and make the U.S. the strongest country for the next few decades. Besides, there is already a much bigger barrier for employing foreign workers and U.S. citizens should not worry about being stolen their jobs. They need to realize that the reason why they cannot get a job is that they are far less competent than others. The United States has always been an immigrant country. Immigrants have contributed so much for this country and they are only going to contribute more. If the U.S. gives away high quality workers to other countries, sooner or later, the U.S. will lose to China, India, and Japan.
