NO, absolutely NOT!!! Any and ALL American companies MUST first employ any American that is looking for work. How dare the government assume that this would go over with the American people. There are far too many Americans out of work for them to even begin to think that it would be acceptable to bring in foreign workers to do the job. Of course, realizing where they are coming from and who they are working for tells you why they are doing this.
