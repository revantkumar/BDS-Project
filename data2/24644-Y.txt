Hi I am a F1 student with OPT right now. I strongly agree to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with stem degree and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.

Firstly F-1 student spend at least four years, for myself, I spend five years to study the theory and knowledge at graduate school. We really need to take our learned knowledge to real application of industry. So we can better understand and absorb the knowledge.

Secondly, many international students came to USA with very good GPA and high IQ. They came to US to study very hard and study STEM major which many US students are not interested. Many of them will be experts in their field. These international students can be assets for US. Even they graduated with either Master or Doctoral degree, they will go to hi-tech company which require very high qualification. 

Thirdly, the international students will not take native America's job opportunities because American have natural advantage-language advantage. If both international students and native American students have the same qualification, I think companies will prefer US citizens. In fact, the job market has more openning opportunies than the number of American graduate students. Therefore these high-tech companies need these students with STEM degree.

In sum, I strongly suggest to improve and expand the OPT opportunites--extend OPT to 24 or 36 month.
