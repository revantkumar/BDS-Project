I am curious about the people who against this proposal. Do they work in a field related to STEM areas? If not related, the OPT extension won't affect their current job and can not help people without STEM degree to find a job. I believe just a few Americans with a related degree can not find a job in a long time. None of my Americans classmates and friends are unemployed. Has a related degree but still unemployed? The reasons are foreign students and OPT? Why not think about the performance when you were a student? 

Cancel the OPT or OPT extension may good for some Americans have a science or technology degree to get a job. But for the development of the whole society, suitable and talented people are much more important.
