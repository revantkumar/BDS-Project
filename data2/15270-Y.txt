It should be a great honor that students from all over the world wants to study in U.S. and serve for U.S. after graduate.

U.S. is a immigration country. It will always be a benifit if more elite students wants to stay.

The extension of STEM OPT doesn't actually hurt on any of the job oppotunity for american citizens.

Companies that hire foreign students only means that these students are more qualified to the specific jobs. Better employees are hired, better competitiveness the company as well as the country has.

The rule that expanding the OPT times not only gives more oppotunities for foreign students to get a better job, but also gives industries more choice of getting better employees.

I strongly support the approving of this proposed rule.
