Charles Pan I strongly agree with this new STEM OPT Rule.

Firstly the requirement of STEM Degree field is increasing year by year , but only US citizens cannot match this high requirements especially like Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic. 

Secondly most of F1 students with STEM Degrees are Master and PHD, US needs these students with 
high degrees to participate in making this country better and better.

Thirdly due to the limitation of the number of HIB application, this rule can provide a fair chance to continue to work in US for those who H1B applications are not draw out every year.
