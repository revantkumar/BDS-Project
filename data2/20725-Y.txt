I do support this extension. American industry is always seeking opportunities to expand its global market with low risk. This requires employees of many American firms should not only have fully understanding regarding American working system and also understand foreign cultures. International students with high educational background are the optimal candidates for being the employees under this scenario. After years of educational training in America, international students possess the abilities to specialize in high technical fields in both domestic and American industries. With the help of these international students, American industry could avoid certain risk exposures while cooperating with foreign partners, or even working in foreign environment. 

Besides, there is a increasing number of international students who do not satisfy being expertise in one field only. They are trying to obtain high educational degrees in multidisciplinary fields, and this is hard to find among American students in STEM programs. With broader knowledge equipped, international students could help American industry to develop its business with more efficiency.

Due to aforementioned reasons, I strongly agreed to extend OPT program for international students to hunt for job opportunities within the United States.
