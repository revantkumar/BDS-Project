Michael Ng Comparing to Canada's policy towards international students, they grant them a 3-year work permit right after graduation! No matter international students get a job or not, they can stay in the country to seek jobs for 3 years! Why we would oppose this extension and be so unfriendly to international students who averagely pay 100,000 for 2 years master and 400,000 for 4 years bachelor's in our universities!

Do we want lose our Silicon Valley and lose competition in the world market? In addition, Extension on STEM does not guarantee STEM students jobs. It only help the experienced students to serve the country's technology advancement. That's critical.
