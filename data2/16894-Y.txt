As an international student now studying in US majoring in Chemical Engineering, I can state that job market is disturbed very little by international students in field of Chemical Engineering. 

Even though there are many job opportunities for chemical engineers, including jobs in chemicals, petroleum, pharmaceuticals and so on, most of the jobs requires that applicant should be an US citizen or permanent resident. They won't hire international students holding a F-1 visa. The job requirement often explicitly states that they won't consider applicant who will require future sponsorship. Under this situation, many comments that international students take away job opportunities lack evidence. As far as I know, it is nearly impossible for an international undergraduate chemical engineering student to find an internship, let alone finding a full-time job. 

Moreover, for a few companies who are willing to sponsor international PhD students, the they always prefer US students first. Jobs for international students are still scarce. Some core technical departments won't hire international students due to technology confidentiality. When the economy is in its downtime, companies tend to fire international students even they have a full-time job. Potential job opportunities decrease greatly and many international students tend to return to their home country after completing their program.
