I do support this proposal, since well-educated STEM students would make US IT industry more competitive. 
To be honest, they are the foundation of future technology and development, as they have experienced top tier education in this field. They are to make something - if not in US, they would contribute to other nations. Let's be rational.
STEM students do simulate the market in growing to a good shape. Top IT companies are hiring people because they are QUALIFIED, not because of they are cheap. In this sense, to get a job one need to be diligent, creative, as well as technical qualified. Simply evicting all *others* are not to make oneself better.
