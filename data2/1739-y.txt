Chao Meng I strongly support expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees. It is so obviously that foreign students and graduates have become a huge power and impact in American's science and engineering industry. It is actually their hard work and contribution that builds the foundation of American's science and technology world. Their contribution help America becoming the No.1 IT industry in the world and recovering from the financial crisis. The extension of OPT would help Nonimmigrant Students better working in US and keep building a great contribution to industry and economy.

United States has held a positive policy on immigrants for hundreds of years. These positive policies help United States gather the greatest scientists and elites around the world and become the strongest and greatest country in the world. We all come from different places, but we come to this country and contribute ourselves to make America the country which we love and proud of. Denying the OPT extension would be a huge downgrade to our policy. 

To conclude, I strongly support passing this new rule on OPT extension by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration and review. 

Sincerely, 

Chao Meng
