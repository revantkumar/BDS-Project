I strongly support this rule. As a foreigner ,I think it is a good chance for our foreign students to find a job in your country,thus this will attract more talented foreign people to work for you, which will definitely benefit to the economic development of your country . And I don't think it will bring harmful effect to your country .I believe that the United States is a open and democratic country that will give opportunities to our international students to pursue our American dream.
