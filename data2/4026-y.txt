Yu Liu International students are not illegal immigrants! They get legal immigration visa to come to US and pay tuition themselves. They have learned a lot of skills, which native Americans do not want to learn. You can check every Engineering Graduate school in US, more than half are international students. And STEM OPT extension can provide opportunities for both the high-tech company and skilled international students. This policy will help to make US economy strong and competitive. Otherwise, these skilled students will be attracted by other countries, like China, India, to help them develop. I think US government should support this policy!
