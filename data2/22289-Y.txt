To protect the job security for the US citizens is the priority for every administration. However, people should know how to let the economy boom and create jobs which benefits American workers. Without the talented people like Elon Musk from South Africa, how can we imagine we can have a green energy electric car for general use. Without international talents like Elon Musk, will the US economy still be as great as nowadays? The answer is no. Only with talents from different places, we can have great economy which create more wealth and job opportunities. In this case, we should give more support for the immigration system for this country. I hope this regulation can be passed and make our broken immigration system fixed.
