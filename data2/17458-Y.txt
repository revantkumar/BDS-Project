I strongly support the OPT extension as it is Vital to the continuing prosperity of the United States of America and the welfare of the residents of the United States. Specifically:

1: Extending the OPT will give STEM aliens a much higher chance of staying. These people will bring knowledge, creativity and productivity to the country that will ensure the role of a global leader of the United States to remain. 

2: The STEM students received their education in the United States of America and have mastered the newest technology. It would be unwise to let them go to their own countries and make contributions to America's global opponents.

3: With the contributions of the STEM students, many related and at the same time most important industries will continue to grow and prosper, and thus create even more jobs, better working environment, and better social welfare for the residents of the United States.

Overall, the STEM students can contribute economic value to the society, fiscal income to the government, and social welfare to the residents.Therefore, I highly suggest the execution of the OPT extension.
