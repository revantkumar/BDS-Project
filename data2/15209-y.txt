Durga Yerra My Suggestion is "Employers must use OPT students for their Internal projects ONLY" not to sub contract to other vendors or their clients.

Most of the small employers (consulting companies) recruit OPT candidates and place them to various clients or sub contracting vendors. 

I have also seen those small consulting companies pay OPT candidates (student/employee) certain percentages i.e 20/80 (20 percent to employer and 80 percent to employee/student) or 30/70 (30 precent to employer and 70 percent to employee) based on OPT candidates earnings through sub contract or paid by their client.
