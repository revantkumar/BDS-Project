Stop the non-sense, send the ILLEGALS home with their families.
Then they can get in line with the rest of the people who want to come here.
Really tired of the politicians fooling around with this countries Constitution!

John, McCain, Carl Rove, Jeff Flake, Lindsay Graham and Obama should be
sent packing. Impeachment would be the gentle way, but resignation would be
the proper way.

The Legal American citizens are afraid that is they say something Obama will send
the IRS or the Justice Dept after them.
