Boris Rees Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A. Based on the experience of last few decades, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields. They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions. This rule will strengthen the relationships between America and other countries. That is, they can share more information, more resources and more opportunities.
