Shush Zhang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The reasons I came to U.S. are not only U.S. had the most advanced technology, but also U.S. had this OPT policy for me to practice what I have learned after my graduation. So I became an international student here. I have leaned knowledge from U.S university and I want to practice the knowledge I have learned in this advanced environment. Moreover, because this country gives me the knowledge I really want to learn about, I also want to do something for this country. If the OPT policy is shorten to ONLY one year, this will lower the attraction of those student who want to go to U.S. to further their studies.

2. I do think most people plan to go back to their own country after several years' working. If the OPT extension is shorten to one year, it will cause those people have a lower strength of competition when they return their country. Since the working experience is very important for employers to consider their own employees. Moreover, this will not only benefit those people who can gain their working experience, but also benefit U.S.. During the working time, they also do a strong contribution to this country, we can see the past to find out many examples.
