I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.As we all know, America has the most famous universities all over the world.Many international students want to enter these universities to accept more advanced education.When they graduate, why dont let them keep making contribution to the US

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. America is always a freedom and diverse country. He accepts different skins, cultures and languages. Many people who got high achievement in US are international students before.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.Many international students has to apply for the jobs which must be in their major, that means they can not apply for many job which will not influence most of Americans life. By the way, for CS or EE, there are not many Americans in this major so international students look like many. But in other area like law or economy, Most of the people are nature Americans. And competition actually improve the ability of no matter Americans students or international students ability. Overall, I think it is a positive way to improve America competition all over the world.
