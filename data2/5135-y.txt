Clair Chan I strongly support this proposed rule cause it is not only a good way for international students who attained or will attain STEM degree in US, but it is also a good strategy for US. US tech companies would suffer lower risk of losing those talent international students. 
International students could user their extension time to contribute more for those companies without worrying about H1B. And for these students, they got their knowledge here in US and all these knowledge are needed by US employee, but only one year couldn't give them enough time to familiar everything and contribute the most to the company.
