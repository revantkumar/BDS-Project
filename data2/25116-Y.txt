I personally agree with the STEM OPT extension by DHS. There are at least three benefits to the country and its economy.

STEM OPT extension will help preserve the talent people with a higher probability. These highly educated people will help a lot in making the US more stronger. For example, in the IT industry, many talented foreign engineers contribute their knowledge to the US IT industry development. No one would defense today's fast development of internet in US has no related with these group of people. The same story can also be found in the science, technology and mathematics fields.

I found someone said that STEM helps the foreigners take the possible job opportunity away from the natives. This is totally a wrong and negative thought. If the amount of native people majored in these fields can satisfy the market demand, and also they are smart and excellent enough to take these jobs, then how can the companies choose to hire some of foreigners instead of the natives? Apparently, the above two conditions are not satisfied. So keep the foreigners is actually helping these industries moving forward. Otherwise, you can imagine when the STEM is canceled, some related companies will lost a lot of employees, how can they continue to run the business with such a big hole.

Also, the promising employing for foreign people also encourage more and more students come to US. That also benefits US education a lot. The high tuition from international students facilitate the universities to run better. In this perspective, the native students with relatively low tuition are the biggest winner. 

To sum up, the way to protect US people's benefits is not to keep the foreigners and also the foreign culture outside of US. The right way is to welcome and learn the good part from them. Keep fighting against it will only make the nation go backward. High competition and diversity will boost the nation to be better.
