The proposed rule of stem opt extension for 24 months by the US government is a much awaited decision and greatly appreciated by all the international students studying in the US universities. It's a win-win situation for both the US government and the international students. 
I personally think that it should be increased to 36 months instead of 24 months if possible as this would always be a benefit to use the services of these students graduating in best universities for the betterment of the economy of the United States.
