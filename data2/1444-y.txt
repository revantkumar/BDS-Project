Yanling Liu In my mind this one should be approved for following reasons:

1. It doesn't make sense to force F1 students to return to their counties after consuming educational resources in the United States. They should have a chance to stay, work, and contribute back to this country.

2. Given current limitation of H1 visa, the 24 months OPT period is fair and very necessary for F1 students to find suitable employment to have chances to contribute back to the United States.

3. Merit-based rules and regulations like this one are necessary to keep the United States more competitive. I have heard that some organizations are claiming F1 students is making job market more competitive. First I want to say the total number of F1 students won't make such a big difference. Second, the United States never afraid of competition. It is the fair competition making this country the 1st one in the whole world.
