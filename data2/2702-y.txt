Jiaping Tian I support it. America is advanced in science and technology, and that's why a lot of foreign students came here for further study. In fact, many employers in IT, Science and Research areas are foreigners instead of native Americans, so students in STEM are important for the development in science and technology in America. Without the OPT extension, most companies in Technology and Engineering will lose employers. I think the extension for OPT in STEM can promote the development in science and technology in America, and attract more students to America for study. It will also bring more income for educational institutes in America.
