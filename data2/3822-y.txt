Sam Lee I support extend the OPT period by 24 months for certain F-1 students who already have full-time job offers. It is useful for company to attract more competitive employees. And it is beneficial for the whole USA economy development. If we refuse to extend the OPT period by 24 months, then fewer and fewer foreign students will study in the US in the future.USA will lose its competitive advantages for attract high quality talents. Both Educationcompanies and government will bear the trouble.
