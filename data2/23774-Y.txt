OPT is a very important part for international talents to make contribution to the American high tech area which will affect a great amount of avenue for the federal government income yearly.

OPT extension provide greater chance for H1B working visa applicants to get their chance for legally working in the United States. So it is important to both the federal government and to the applicants with bright mind who can make profit for the America society.

As a result, I believe the extension of F-1 OPT should be passed without any doubt and this is the only way to provide a win win situation for both side.
