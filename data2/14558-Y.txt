The proposed rules are fantastic both for the F1 students who major in STEM degrees and for the American companies who need talents in STEM fields. It is also a good news for American economy. Those tech companies who need STEM talents are becoming a strong force in booting economical growth and creating job opportunities. This extension on OPT gives those companies enough time to get to know those graduates and select future employees. 

Without the proposed rules, new graduates can only have 12 month to seek for positions and show their ability to help the company grow. But we all know the interview process might take up to 6 month. And due to the quota of H1B and gap between ending of OPT and starting of H1B, even those who got a job offer will be forced to leave USA before their first work anniversary. The sudden absence of employment is definitely harmful for both the employee and the employer. Also notice that those students who are educated and trained here would go to companies at other countries who are also competitors of US companies. 

I hope the officials can see the benefits of the proposed rules and make the right decision.
