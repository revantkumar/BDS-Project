I strongly SUPPORT the OPT-EXTENSION proposal for the following reasons:

1.High level education with chances of experiences are the attraction that attracted plenty of international students to study and learn in the US. America has a brilliant project of university education that students have a time to practice after graduated from U.S. University, which is OPT.Without OPT or OPT-extension, students will lose the chances to do internships or corporations in this country, the merits of Studying in U.S. will lose a lot.As we know, undertaking revenue is one of the important revenue of a country, the government must values it.I believe especially as a powerful country as America won`t miss it. 

2.International Students in U.S.do very value the OPT and OPT-EXTENSION. And it is also a reason that students apply for U.S university to study. However, OPT is very limited, students could have made more contributions to the US and themselves,if it be extended. Due to no OPT-EXTENSION,those excellent international students have to leave U.S. before they contribute more for the country.It is such a big regret for both of U.S. and students.Practices need time and experiences, nobody could master their study and work immediately. 

3.International students spend a lot in U.S. University,they should obtain more chances to raise themselves and practice the knowledge that they learned from U.S. People learned the knowledge and they should practice and apply to the works,Without experience, people will ignorant to the value of knowledge they have absorbed.And students spend a long-term to learn in U.S.,they have adapted to American pattern,so the best area to practice is U.S absolutely. 

4. The government should let the students who spend time and money from U.S. University and let them keep making contributions to the U.S
