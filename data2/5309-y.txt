John Rambo In my opinion it is very important for the STEM Extension program to stay in place for a period of at least 24 months. It will allow international students to practice what they have studied. Not only gaining experience is important but what needs to be understood that education for international students is not cheap. It is exorbitantly expensive. Students like to come to the US for studies as it has top notch research facilities and education institutions. Families back home have to incur huge loans to study in the US. 12 months OPT is not at all enough to help international students in paying these loans. International students should not be treated differently than American students in terms of loans repayment. International students require much more time,due to higher tuition fee charged, than American students to repay loans. Other point is that international students contribution to IT in America is immense. International students after graduation help in generating jobs for the American economy and later a lot of them go on to find start ups which later become big companies. People need to stop seeing international students as someone who is taking American jobs away. If that was the case then there wouldn't be so many vacant positions in American IT industry. There are IT jobs for everyone. If international students were a burden for US IT industry, then blue chip companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft will not be supporting the cause of international students. Please be considerate and understand the situations of international students and not just listen to a small association of tech workers who for some reason feel cheated or frustrated due to international students in US IT industry.
