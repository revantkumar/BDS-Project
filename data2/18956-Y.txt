I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. International students in U.S. made more contribution than U.S. students. As is well known, international students get good GPAs and good research results in universities. Those good students will make different in U.S. which is beneficial for the country. 
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.As we all know, international students didn't take the place of U.S. citizens for those job which is easy and get low salary. Those positions which require high knowledge or high degree can not find proper employee who has citizenship. Competition will improve the education level of the whole society. In this way, U.S. will becoming better than other country all over the world.
