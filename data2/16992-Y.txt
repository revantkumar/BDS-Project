As an American born STEM engineer, I highly support extend OPT to 24 months and provide more opportunity for international talent.

I was totally shocked by some comments from American complaining they cannot find a job because of foreigner labor. Please be aware that: OPT is for high degree international graduate, not entry level technician or worker. Without the contribution from these people, USA will be much less competitive in technology and engineering areas. Then how can we expect American can find more jobs? 

Also, it's totally unfair to complain OPT student pay less tax. DO NOT forget they paid very high tuition during their bachelor/master/PhD study. Indeed, some of them have scholarship. But this is based on their extraordinarily contribution in academics and extremely hardworking in lab everyday. Please ask yourself: how much time you spent during your college? If not enough, then we cannot blame OPT. 

Anyway, please help pass this policy ASAP. God bless America.
