I, to an extremely large extent, support this proposal that extends the OPT period to 24 months for STEM students specific in some fields like science, technology and engineering. The society of United States of America is a multicultural one that can accommodate all kinds of people from all around world as long as they can contribute to the prosperity of their own field, whether directly or not. My history teacher told me that the advantage that US took to gain its leadership in almost every aspect is that it has attracted nearly all talented person who is second to none. In this point of view, rejecting this proposal that elongate OPT period is nothing but a recession of a comprehensive nation. Some people may hold the apprehension that international students, with OPT proposal adopted, may grab their own job. But after a thorough scrutiny one can easily find this apprehension as totally unnecessary. Yes, we must admitted that in some areas there is a preponderance of employee from abroad. But it is undeniable that many of these peoples set up their own business which, to the ground, also help to relieve the overall job pressure.
