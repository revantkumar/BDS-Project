I highly support this proposed rule,

US is an open country and has had a very well established fair labor environment, for the past couple of years, people have seen how significantly foreign people have help increased the US economics, especially after the financial crisis.

From the educational prospective, this extended rule will allow more students from other countries to study here and get a job, making positive contribution to US education development, as well as the communication between different countries

It is also very good as of companies global strategies, to have more people well trained in US, and be able to expand their business to other countries.

I do not see any reasons why people will not support this beneficial rule.
