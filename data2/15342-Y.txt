I strongly support this extension for following reasons.

First of all, this will help attract more and more talent international students around world to come to America and this will help a lot to American economy and science.

Second, actually more talent students will create more job opportunities in USA, which will in turn help American people.

Finally, this extension will also help to increase the number of international students who will spend a lot of money in USA, which will help to increase economy and create more job positions in USA.
