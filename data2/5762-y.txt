Emma Wang Foreign students who have STEM degree are a very valuable asset to the US. The STEM related area is a huge fuel to drive the economy to grow, especially under the current economy environment. The major growth of the economy are areas such as technology, engineering, medical and so on. US government and education institutes have spent billions of money in educating these students to be specialists in those areas. However, the majority of students holding the STEM degree are immigrants or international students. If the US government do not try to build a relaxed economic and immigrant environment, more and more students who are specialized in these areas will return to their home countries or the countries where have better immigrant policy. Due to the gap of economic and living environment between US and the other developing/developed countries becomes closer and closer, the good immigrant policy will be the key elements that US can keep these valuable intelligent. The previous immigrant policy needs to be updated. The pressure coming from the H1B lottery has kept many brilliant people away from the US job market and even the choice of coming to study in the US. The cheating created by the Indian ICC is also very unfair to some Indian people and all other immigrants from other countries. The existence of ICC is also caused by the H1B lottery. Overall, the old H1B policy needs to be refined and try to be fair to the people who have relatively competitive reason to stay in US. This new OPT policy cannot only release the pressure of the H1B lottery, moreover, it can decrease the cheating cases filed by the ICC. This is the reason that I strongly support the OPT extension. In addition, I strongly suggest that the government can refine the immigrant law to have more competitive immigrants to stay.
