I will STRONGLY SUPPORT OPT extension for F1 student. Those students are very excellent and most of them will become top experts in the future. They are treasures for US. Losing them will be big lose for US. They contributes what they've learned and researched in their fields, which makes US the top in the world. On the other side, they will not make US citizen lost their jobs since those F1 students which qualified the OPT extension work on the fields which most citizen may not interested at all. Again, I will support this proposal.
