The Department for HOMELAND SECURITY is required to abide by the principles that protect American interests on our own soil. Yet they propose a program, Optional Practical Training (OPT) which gives employers incentives for hiring FOREIGN students over Americans! This program does not serve the 430,000 Americans who lost out to foreign students during the 2009-20013 period. In addition, these foreign students are being paid less than their American counterparts which allows American companies to reap profits at the expense of Americans, and are misusing the program to stay in the U.S. longer than they would have been able to.

Furthermore, as Senator Charles Grassley has stated, 
"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."

Is the DHS TRULY the Department of Homeland Security, or simply the Department of Foreign Security?
