I strongly support the OPT extension for the STEM students. It's already been much more difficult for foreigners to find a job in the US, comparing with US citizens. Those STEM students who are able to find a job are generally much more skilled and qualified than other candidates for very few companies are willing to sponsor the visa or to deal with the visa issues. It will hurt the US development more if these students are not allowed to continue working after one-year opt.
