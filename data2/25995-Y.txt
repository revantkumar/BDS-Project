I strongly support this proposed rule as an engineer, student and a foreigner. OPT STEM students are not taking over citizens' jobs. In my company, STEM students are helping a lot with the fundamental engineering work while not taking jobs from citizens. In fact, the total amount of IT industry jobs are far more than citizen professionals and it is nearly impossible for citizens to fill all the positions in IT industry. (Especially citizens students are more willing to do finance and other non-STEM majors).

Also, there are many talented engineers and scientists who can really improve the STEM industry in U.S. Students who come to U.S for education are more likely to be very talented and skilled. So many talented students come to U.S and they are willing to do something that is useful not only for themselves but also for technology improvement in the world. Please take a look at the Google's new open source machine intelligence library, Tensor Flow, (http://tensorflow.org/about) ,see these great contributor, scientist and engineer names, and see how many great researchers and engineers names are exotic. They are from everywhere in the world but they came to U.S and contributed to the whole world. If there is no extension for STEM students, majority of them would have to leave U.S and U.S will lose tons of potential scientists and great engineers. It would be a great loss not only for U.S but also for the whole world since U.S has the best research environment in the world. Therefore I strongly support this proposed rule.
