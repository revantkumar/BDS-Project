Judy Tsai This proposal will benefit U.S in the long run. It will attract more students to pursue their degrees (especially in STEM field) in the U.S by giving them enough time to complete their training. As someone who has been doing research for several years, I think sufficient time is a significant factor in successful projects since experiments can take longer time than expected. OPT also encourages students to apply their academic STEM knowledge to work, which, in my opinion, will benefit U.S employers since we are in shortage of native workers in STEM fields.
