I'm commenting to endorse the OPT STEM extension from 17 to 24 months. Currently, my place of employment has invested in hiring myself (local), many others, as well as those currently on student visas. The many regulated windows and hurdles have slowed down the H-1B visa process and without the extended window, some of my coworkers could run the risk of losing their student visa before the H-1B. 

This points to a larger issue in the United States. We invest greatly into the education of many, including individuals from outside the country but then we do not help them stay here. We train and educated people, and then we push people away. Any measures to help prevent this retro-brain-drain should be embraced. Ultimately, keeping my not-yet-citizen coworkers here is a benefit to all.
