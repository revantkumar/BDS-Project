I am opposed to the so called "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees." There are plenty of American students that could benefit from this type of training. Not to mention the number of unemployed Americans that have been terminated from these type jobs in order to bring in cheaper labor on H1B visas. Corporations should not be allowed to overlook the American worker, which has often been the case, when filling these positions. Quit selling out America by subsidizing these corporations with this type of support. Put America first. We are already inundated with illegals taking away jobs from Americans, now you want to allow more people to come into our country causing further decline for the middle class. Americans are getting sick and tired of being overlooked/layed off in our own country in order for corporations to make more money.
