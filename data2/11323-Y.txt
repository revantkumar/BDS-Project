Well, to tell the truth, many USA high tech start up cant even find qualified programmer to start bussiness if there are not so many foreign student studying STEM in USA. When i was applying CS job and i've asked several of these company's HR and they said US cityzen programmers do not intend to join start up company, and they need to find enough programmer to start business. US high tech is experiencing a blooming these years, and there is no doubt that one of the most important reason is that there are so many excellent student coming from all over the world work for high tech company of USA after they graduate. Can you imagine what will happen if in the future,a lot of them only have to go back home if not lucky enough to get H1B? First the high tech company will get hurt, and high tech is what makes America standing at the top place in the world. Second, there will be not so many students in the future, why would they come to USA just to see if they can win a lottery with rate like only 50%. We all know that America is found and built by generations of immigrants and lets not forget this and just give more and more excellent foreign students bigger chance to achieve their american dream!
