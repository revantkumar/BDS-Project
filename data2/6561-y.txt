Dan Skempton I fully support the rule of improving and expanding training opportunities. Generally, STEM major F-1 students are outstanding and intelligent people in their country who come to USA to pursue higher degrees, such as master or PhD degrees. AS STEM major students, they also eager to gain work experience. With this OPT extension opportunity, more people would like to come to USA for higher degree education because they know they can gain foreign work experience which is very important in their career. Without this after graduation training opportunity, USA will gradually loose its attraction in the foreign students market.
