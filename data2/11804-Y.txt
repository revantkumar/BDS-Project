I strongly support this proposal.

First, to let high tech companies hire more talented people will create more job opportunities and bring more profits. To limit the range of their recruitment and selection can only be harmful. 

Second, international students won't take the job opportunities from domestic students. The only reason for those who don't have jobs is that they don't meet the requirement for those companies, and this won't be effected by anyone else except themselves.

Finally, to limit the job opportunities for international students will decrease the attraction of US education to future talented students. This will weaken the strength of the U.S. in the future.
