I think the new rule is definitely beneficial to the US economy and the American people in general. Not only because there is a severe scarcity of qualified STEM workers in US, and the new rule could help the US companies and entrepreneurs to greatly enhance the business workflow; but the talents that we retain by this new rule may someday become transforming power that could enable the US to lead the world in a fast paced, globally competitive future environment! I totally support this new rule proposed by the Department of Homeland Security, great work!
