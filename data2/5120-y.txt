BHAVANA PALLEPATI I want to discuss the factors concerning stem OPT extension.Normally,Students from different other countries wants to pursue higher studies and want to get a job in United States of America(USA).Because US is the Number 1 country which stands in Education and employment.Obviously,every student goal from the age of childhood is to get into a top university/college and get a good job.As,the cost of education in foreign countries is higher.The cost of education is higher than their income in native countries.If the students are not allowed to permit for 24 stem extension how can the students bear the cost of education they have taken for studying in the US university.US government also has a good point to review that,if the knowledge is added, the country will develop high in its economic growth too.Ultimately to the end, the number of companies will grow in its number and employment will also grow higher.In the other side,though if the government allows foreigner's the employment of US citizens will not go down,rather the number of companies increases and ultimately end up with economic growth and increase in employment.Frighting for competition in employment sector is not the point to be considered rather improving the knowledge and sharing the knowledge gives the growth to country in all its fields.Hence,I strongly support the stem extension of 24 months policy to the F1 students.
