I am stongly agree to extent the OPT. The reason are as follows:
In STEM major, only a few native people are willing to read, so there are a lot of vacancies about this kind of job, F1 students can help companys to fill the vacancy.
Second, a lot students who are in STEM are willing to work in US. It is a good opportunity to let students stay in US
Third, US needs multiculturalism, Internation students can bring all kinds of different culture
In sum, Istrongly agree to extent the OPT.
