I am a Chinese who have been resident in UK for 6 years finished my bachelor there and now is working in Birmingham as a new migrant. I was have a chance to be an official exchange student for half year with J1 visa to Albany NY from my home university in UK. It was a great experience and is almost totally different from UK even you are have similar culture background. I am so impressive by the American people's hard working, the welcoming for different people, which is completely different from UK. I believe this is make it USA is outstanding in the world and attractive talent people from everywhere. 

There is no way a country getting stronger, richer, more powerful because of close their door. From the view of outsider, I am actually happy to see the project will be rejected. If so it means that letting other behind countries having chance to catching up the development and got the talent who supposed go to America. Please consider long term, the world will only get more competitive, step back? Fine. Let's others run!
