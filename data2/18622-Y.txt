I am fully in support of this rule proposal for expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees. We are living in a world where technology has become a major part of our world. Technology has helped many undeveloped countries strengthen their economies and become more powerful at world stage. For example: China, India, South Korea, Philippines, Singapore, etc. These countries have a massive work force in the STEM fields and they are easily beating the USA in competition. In the near future, it'll be hard for the US to keep up with the rest of the world. Therefore, this country needs to take necessary steps right now to build a massive work force of engineers, scientists, doctors and mathematicians to secure the top position as an innovative world leader. This will not only help the country secure its future but also help it remain the biggest economy in the world.
