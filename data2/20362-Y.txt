As a H1 visa holder, I would like to support the newly proposed rule. As we all know, the international students not only bring in diversity to this country, they also make a great contribution to the development of tech field. These people who are complaining that they cannot find jobs because of these students is unfair. As far as I know, the international people have already been in bias under the job market. Company would rather hire a domestic people then hire a more qualified people for the job. Plus, there're already rules against the company to balance the population of the international workers in tech company. Therefore, all the people who are complaining are not true. They shouldn't blame their situation on these students' fault. The H1B lottery is getting more and more competitive each year. If all these students are forced to leave this country, I think it's gonna bring a huge loss and tragedy to the US economy.
