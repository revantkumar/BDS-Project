James Chung Bringing more foreign labor forces does not mean reducing the job opportunities for citizens at all. More highly educated workers results in more competitive enterprises, bigger markets, and ultimately more job opportunities for all!

I live in a college town, and with the increasing number of international students the number of restaurants and bars increased significantly. Without OPT extension, our universities will become far less competitive in getting international students: Canada, Australia, UK etc. are all competing with the US!
