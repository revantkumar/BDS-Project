I strongly support this amendment because loosing young and skilled people by sending back will definitely effect on our country. Instead of encouraging outsourcing jobs and giving to H1B to other nations, to give OPT extension for STEM students is very advantage to America. Which can help to get taxes from workers instead of loosing by outsourcing projects and and also will increase strength of universities by international students fees. The US government has a chance to select skillful labor by giving 2 years OPT extension for serve our country needs. Simply this decision can support always United states occupy first place in the world. And the good thing is that Who lived and studied in US and work for US will think always to favor favor of our country. Thanks and GOD BLESS AMERICA.
