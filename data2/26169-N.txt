The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix. I am an immigrant and applied and qualified for a Green Card, which allowed for permanent status at some point if I so wished when I came here in 1968. I had to work my way through the system to eventually become a Citizen on August 9th 1975. They are only supposed to be here for a set period of time and should be forced to go back to their own country.
