We, the American People of the USA, first need to look after our own..our youth and young adults out of college and give them employment before those of foreign nations. Our people need jobs so they do not become dependent on the government system thereby putting the USA in even greater debt. We also need to take care of our soldiers before illegal aliens. We also need to quit bringing people over from other countries when we cannot or won't take care of our own people.
