I really thinks the OPT STEM program should take into action this time. Most of universities benefit from international student since there will be more variety in this field and OPT STEM program will be a great attraction to international students since they could have up to three years work experience after finishing the education in US. Companies will also benefit from OPT STEM program since most project requires a long term participation 2 to 3 years and some are even longer. OPT STEM program will make sure companies would not suffer from employee insufficiency for their projects and would not suffer from profit loss. So I strongly agree that the OPT STEM should be approved and take into action as soon as possible.
