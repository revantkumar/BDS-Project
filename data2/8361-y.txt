Jianyuan Liu As a student from China, I support this policy for the following reasons:
1) Democracy in America has always been recognized in us Chinese people. And if the local protection is what most Americans stand in favor of, then that will we contradictory to the value of Americans.
2) STEM extension is just a manner to ensure mostly internships, which will not do much harm to local Americans.
3) The reason why I want to choose the U.S. to be the place for my next studying period is its value of freedom and democracy. If such ideas are abandoned, then I will feel very disappointed.

I strongly recommend those who have counter opinions to reflect whether this is the right way to help solve unemployment.
