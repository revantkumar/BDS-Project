Data from previous years shows, skilled immigrants have made great contributions in the innovation and ground breaking research. It is my firm belief that immigrants need to be given the time and benefit of the superior technology in America to help build the foundation for a culturally diverse, fundamentally strong economy. With a 24 month extension on the OPT , the skilled workforce has enough motivation and time to create something that could potentially change the world.
