David Scott I am a landlord, I rent out one of my apartment to people want to rent house. Those years most of my tenants are Chinese students. They are really nice. They always keep house clean, do not make noise, never pay rent late and they are really polite when I communicate with them.
It seems OPT extension is nothing about me, but actually, it counts. If OPT extension policy can not be passed, not only many students who are now studying in STEM would leave US, students who are fighting for study aboard also would change their mind to study in US. My apartment is near a university, in which there are a lot Chinese students. I prefer to rent apartment to Chinese students since I also live on second floor and I like a relatively quite environment, unlike american students or other people who like hold home party, Chinese students would not make noise. If there are fewer Chinese students going to study in US, my apartment might not be find adequate tenants. So I strongly support OPT extension.
