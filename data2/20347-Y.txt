I strongly support the rule to be carried out. 
I think it was because United States gave people from all over the world equal opportunities that made this country the leader of the world. That was the core competence. It was proven by the fact that graduated international students have created considerable values in the technology related area in the past few years that brought up the economy of the United States and made people's life better. It's a wise move to pass the rule and keep the talent.
