Support the extension of OPT. The succeed of US is its Immigrant policy, it helps the country to attract the most smart students around the world. OPT let these smart foreign students serve our country after their graduation. Since the existence of OPT, foreign students are more likely to choose our country instead of UK as the country to study abroad, and we have already get a lot of benefit from the increase of foreign students--a large amount of tuition they bring to our country. If the extension of OPT stop suddenly, we will no longer be able to attract these students, which may bring harm to our education system. 

The extension of OPT not only help us attract foreign students, but also help the country to get top engineers & scientists. We use our own education resources to train them, why do we allow them to use the knowledge got from education of US to serve their mother country? Stupid! Before they come to US these foreign students are already top students. After they get their degree in US, they will become the Most Shortage of Talents. If we let them back to serve their mother country, there is no doubt that after 10 years, these talent students will lead their country in different fields to threaten the leadership of US.
