I say STOP ALL IMMIGRATION--ESPECIALLY ILLEGAL ALIEN INVASION--UNTIL EVERY U.S. CITIZWN WHO WANTS A JOB HAS ONE-PERIOD!
This idea of we don't have enough citizen workers is nonsense and saying foreign workers do the jobs that Americans *won't* do is ludicrous!!
Mike Rowe had a TV series--Dirty Jobs-- that debunked that phony theory but the amnesty crowd will lie about everything to get their way!

Obama wants as many foreigners here as possible because--foreigners won't fight as hard for our Constitution as a born here citizen will!
He also wants as many foreigners here as possible as it squews the census for the electoral college at election time.

Obama needs to be impeached if he goes ahead with his plan for amnesty against the ruling of Federal Judge Hanen of TX!
