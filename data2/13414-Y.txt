Hi. Without a long time work permit for STEM student, I won't consider studying in the US. All I want is to study here and work a couple years and go back to my country. I have no interest in immigration.
Most STEM students are paying full tuition to the US. Native students are having high scholarships. Without foreign students' tuition, native students can hardly have high scholarships. I pay a lot money to study in the US, and just try to practice a couple years of what I learned. In my opinion, the US is good for my study but not as good as my motherland China in terms of living. So please don't worry about I would stay here longer than the job needs.
