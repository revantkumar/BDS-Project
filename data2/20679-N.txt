What is wrong with our government. Those jobs that have not been sent offshore to foreign countries/companies will now be filled by foreign students rather than by American citizens. It is not your job to help foreign students gain employment in the U.S. and the become permanent residents of the U.S., it is your job as American government employees to protect American jobs for American citizens.

Do not pass this amnedment. Keep American jobs for America's graduating students and future leaders of America.

Sincerely,

Leon Donahue
