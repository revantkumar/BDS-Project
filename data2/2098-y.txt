Allen Smith I strongly support OPT extension. I work in the IT industry and like to share a few things in the industry.

1. The F1 students using OPT are NOT underpaid. They are interviewed here just like any U.S. citizen. Companies use a consistent standard to evaluate candidates, and make offers regardless of the candidates' legal status or country of origin.

2. There's no evidence that OPT workers will harm job markets. As previously pointed out, the OPT workers are paid with a fair market price, so it's really a fair competition and it's their intelligence and diligence won them the job offers. Less and less U.S. young adults are interested in a career as an engineer or scientist, the STEM OPT workers didn't take job opportunities from equally talent U.S. citizens, but instead took the jobs that U.S. citizens are unwilling to do. 

3. OPT workers will help IT giants keep their leading positions.There's a lack of talent in the silicon valley even with the current amount of OPT workers in the job market. More well trained OPT workers can keep the rapid growth of IT giants and provide more job opportunities for U.S. citizens in other majors such as sales, product management, human resources etc. Stopping the OPT extension, on the other hand, will only harm the IT giants, harm the U.S. economy, and possibly lead to higher unemployment rates.
