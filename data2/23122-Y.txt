I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. As an international student in the US, I learned knowledge from U.S. university and hope to contribute back to the country. Obviously, the knowledge would be better applied to where it comes from. Additionally, hiring international students helps and speeds up trade among countries without any cultural conflicts and misunderstandings. 
2. Some of my friends gave up their offers from top universities in U.K. and came to the U.S. It is not only because universities in U.S. have high standards of teaching and advanced laboratories, but also because U.S. has friendly policies for international students, i.e. extension for OPT. I believe most students would hesitate over their choices of coming to America if they lose this support
3. Honestly, I do think many international students plan to return to their home country after several years in the U.S. It is important to gain the working experience in the U.S. before we return back to our countries. Without the working experience in the U.S., we lose a competitive strength comparing to other employees when we return to our countries. After several years working in the U.S. we may consider returning to find a better occupation in our own counties. There is no worrying about occupying job positions for U.S. citizens since some of us may not want to stay in U.S. permanently.
