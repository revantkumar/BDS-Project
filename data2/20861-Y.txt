I strongly support the OPT extension proposal. I am a postdoc currently on OPT extension. The typical time period for a physics postdoc is 3 years. It makes no sense to me if I have to change my immigration status during that time. It takes a lot of extra work (plus money) to do such a thing.It is just a waste of time.
