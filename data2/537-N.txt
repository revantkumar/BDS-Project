Homeland Security Dept. should not be making the laws without Congress and the people voting on the law. Government should not be giving foreign students priority over American citizens. Foreign students should not be getting 3 years working time available to them. The law should be kept at 1 year for foreign students. If changed to 3 years that gives big money tech companies free ride to hire foreign students over American citizen students - NOT RIGHT!!! Give our AMERICAN VETS priority over any foreign person!!! for health benefits, jobs and mostly welfare!!!
