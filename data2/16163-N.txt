I totally oppose your Optional Practical Training proposed rule. Former foreign students should not remain in our labor market after graduating. DHS should craft a rule limiting such employment to the absolute minimum authorized by statute. It is truly horrendous that DHS is proposing to expand a program that gives non-citizen employees a 15% or more cost advantage over American employment applicants. Honestly, it is bizarre that you call yourselves Americans when you write these rules. Vic Simon, Takoma Park, MD
