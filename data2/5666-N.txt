I feel that the proposed rule from the DHS to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a unfair to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs. As a result, this would encourage lower wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program encouraages employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
