I strongly support this proposal as it will fulfill the engineering vacancies with qualified people. The international students worked very hard and did make great contributions to their employers. I have seen too many natives doing really bad job and did not even know what they were doing. International students will keep USA competitive globally. Please go ahead with this reform.
