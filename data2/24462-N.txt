OPT must be stopped. Beyond the obvious reason that our children will not have a future if OPT goes forward, the practice of importing foreign students to take American jobs means less tax dollars moving into the federal coffers, and less dollars flowing into Social Security. The Federal government has STOLEN billions of dollars from the Social Security trust fund to spend on other things. If our children do not have a secure financial future, and these F1B workers are not paying into Social Security, The funds will deplete even faster than previously expected. Seniors financial security is being bartered away to make room for NON U.S. citizens to get on the job training related to their studies while we taxpayers are left to fend for ourselves when the benefits we've paid into goes bankrupt. American citizens are NOT being represented to our government because the president is not working with Congress in declaring these "policies". Taxation without representation was one of the key factors in the first American revolution, and may well be the catalyst that starts the next American revolution. We are being betrayed by the government that is supposed to work for us. Enough is enough.
