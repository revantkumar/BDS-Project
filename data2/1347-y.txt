josh li I will share some of my option as below, in a word, I support this term.

- It provides at least an opportunity for chance of diversification, which, will leads to more innovation,creative, or at least, an different perspective to look into one problem/task, which, is the necessary environment of all the above.

- The STEM students could make contribution to US using their specific skill set and knowledge if they could get the chance to stay longer. All the IT, Tech and Engineer department needs talent no matter where they coming from.

- We have to say competition exists everywhere, but that is not a bad thing, one foreigner get job does not equal that an American will lose job, foreigners working really hard, or from what I seen, at least same as USA friends.

- STEM students pay MORE tax than Americans, including the SSN and medicaid.
