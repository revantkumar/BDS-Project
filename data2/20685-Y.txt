I am strongly support this proposal that extends OPT to 24 months.
Firstly, I'm an international student who plan to graduate next June. It's unfair that we've paid high tuition but cannot get the related working experience. What's more, OPT and OPT extension for STEM is the most greatest reason why I came to America to study. Before we came here, US government has promised it to us. If US government cancel this extension, then the country would lose a majority of talents from different counties.
Secondly, native American cannot fulfill the needs of the job market in terms of high-tech positions. I think it's reason why STEM major has OPT extension. As I know, such as data science, there are a lot of professional foreigners in this area.
