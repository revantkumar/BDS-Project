I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

The proposal to reinstall the STEM extension will give me a chance to apply what I learn in the classroom to the real world. Such hands-on experiences are invaluable to my career development. 

This STEM extension is also one of the main reasons I choose to attend graduate school in U.S. Because I know I will have more than 1 year to practice what I learn after my graduation. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects instead of some short-term ones. This is also one of the most attracting reason why U.S. graduate schools are preferred by international students like me. 

I strongly urge the pass of the rule for the benefit of international students and U.S. schools.
