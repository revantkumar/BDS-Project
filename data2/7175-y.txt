Pallavi Singh (2nd Comment) Dear ICEB,

Please extend the proposal of STEM program as it will not only help International students to achieve new goals and horizons but also help in the development of economy globally.

All the new concepts like Big Data and Predictive Modelling has been introduced in US first and As per McKinley study this area results in jobs more than themanpower by 2030 as a result many foreign universities are introducing thus course into their program & many international students are getting the opportunity to learn the concept and contribute in US economy but if this proposal will not be extended immigrants will fear to take the course as I am feeling now that what if I will not get the proper job but might be chances of participating in this concept by other countries which hardened the competition for Stat & the university as well.Kindly consider these points and approve the extension of STEM program.
Warm Regards,
Pallavi
