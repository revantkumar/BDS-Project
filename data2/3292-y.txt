Sophia Rose I strongly support the extension of Optional Practical Training (OPT). 

With the highest education quality, America attracts so many students all over the world. Lots of my friends from other countries have finished their Master degrees of Computer Science. Thanks to the OPT policy, they were hired by famous companies like Google and Facebook, contributing to the development of Information Technology. Some have already started their own business after working for several years, creating large amounts of jobs for the public. Therefore, after the extension, they would have more opportunities to make the technology more advanced and the unemployment rate lower.

On the other hand, if the OPT were extended, America would appeal to more foreign students. Their enrollment could be beneficial for the economy of surrounded cities since they would buy food, clothes and cars.
