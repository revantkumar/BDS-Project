Hello Mr. Johnson, 

Thanks a ton for such great changes and great work in the OPT extension Improvisation in such a faster pace, and greater benefits to a great Nation.

I am writing to you in regard to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) on improving and expanind teh training opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant students with degrees and cap gap relief for all eligible F1 students. 

I am a graduate from Lamar University in Texas with a 17 month OPT. As per the new rule from comment #49, I understand from that we can apply for 7 month extension period. But it states the criteria that, one must apply 120 days prior his 17 month OPT expires. My opt will expire on Feb 2nd, I wouldn't be eligible for another extension (Because I don't have 120 days period) as the rule is not finalised yet. It would be really a big help if we are also given an opportunity to apply for 7 more months which gives us another chance to test our luck for H1 again in Apri 2016. There are many people who arent luck enough like me where H1 is not picked in the lottery, and are struggling to be in the legal status. 

In this case, we have to choose a college, which offers day 1 CPT, which might not be near our work place, have to travel at least twice a month, do assignments, projects and also work in the office every day.

If we are given an opportunity, it would really, really make OUR LIVES happier, we will apply for H1 again in 2016 April.. It would really be of great help to " A few hundreds " over here who are thousands of miles away from their homes since years.. 

Writing this on behalf of many of my friends who wish the same thing to happen. Thanks for giving me this opportunity.
