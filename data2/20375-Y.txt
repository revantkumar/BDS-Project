I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. International students are willing to study in United Status not only because U.S. offers better education, but also U.S. offers good opportunities to let them make contribution from what they learned from school. 
There may be competition especially in IT industry between international students and U.S. citizen. But I think it is more easy for citizen to find a job, because a lot of job require U.S citizen and company are willing to hire U.S citizen. (Why should company take risk that their employee may leave the company because of lack of working authorization?) Thus the reason why company hiring international students is because they are more capable for this position. And that helps the company stronger. United States should welcome talent people make contribution to U.S society regardless of the citizenship. That's how U.S become the strongest country. 
It is totally good for the country and for the future. Please approve it.
