FACT:

"A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds."

OPT should be abolished.

In a time when there are so many unemployed or under-employed American citizens in this country, any efforts to encourage competition from non-US citizens for jobs is reprehensible. The true unemployment rate far exceeds the number touted in statements since this figure does not include those that have exhausted their unemployment benefits and/or have ceased to look for employment out of frustration.

OPT should never have had access to precious funds from Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Those funds are for the citizenry of the US, not for pet projects for non-citizens.
