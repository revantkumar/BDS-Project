I am an international PhD student major in Petroleum Engineering, and I strongly support the new OPT policy.
First, the industry needs STEM students to deliver good work. Taking oil and gas industry as an example, most people who work in the Research and Development units are not native Americans. They all worked hard to earn credibility and kept making contribution to the industry.
Second, US is always friendly to immigrants and those immigrants made huge contribution to the US. If the OPT extension is cancelled, thousands employees working for Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter and so on will have to leave the states, which will greatly harm the technology development in the US.
Third, less potential students will choose the US for a graduate school due to unfriendly working policy. This would lead to a poorer quality of graduate students in the US university.
