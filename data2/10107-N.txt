this corrupt good for nothing person needs to be stopped now not later. doing for cronies is becoming a very bad habit of his and Congress does nothing. he need to be impeached today not tomorrow for his lawless ways. if this was a white president like Nixon he would be impeached by now. what in the hell is wrong with Congress. do they want to sit back and watch our country go to ruin by a man that is not even an American citizen by birth. if he were in front of me and said he was a citizen I would have to call him a liar to his face. And people in Washington in government wonder why we the people don't trust them anymore. thier all about money large business interest ...oh yeah when its election time they smile and shake your hands but after they care about the people one damn bit.
