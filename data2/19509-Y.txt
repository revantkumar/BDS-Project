I support this proposal. Our country, the US, is the strongest country in the world. This is because we have the best science, the best technology, and the best industry. All of these are supported by our best education. International students are the most important resources that we have, and it is the reason why we are US - we attract the best people all over the world to this country, and contribute to this country.

The original 1-year opt will make many international students decide to leave our country. They have received the best education but have to leave, and contribute to their own countries. That would be a huge loss to the US.

I absolutely support this proposal. Please expand the training opportunities.
