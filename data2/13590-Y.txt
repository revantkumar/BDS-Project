The STEM F1 students cannot rob jobs from US citizens who has the STEM skills, because we all know many companies "protect" natives by do not hire foreign students or consider them as second choice. Those talented foreigners can help to create jobs for US citizens in more general fields. 

The 24 month extension will not harm those talented US STEM students when finding a job. As long as they have required skills, company definitely prefer them than STEM F1 students.
