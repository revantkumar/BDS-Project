I strongly support this rule. America is THE land of opportunities, people come to America for dreams that can not be fulfilled in their own countries. For foreigners, the competition is even harder because language problem and culture gap.
We can not achieve what we are now without "foreigners". Just look at Silicon Valley, if there is no "foreigners", all the companies in Silicon Valley will shut down due to lack of engineers.
Because of those hard working "foreign" engineers, we are the No. 1 over the whole world in IT field. We have Alpha, Facebook, Oracle, LinkedIn, Apple. These companies all have a same simple goal, making our life simple and convenient, and push the limit further and further based on this simple goal. We should thank for America providing such a fantastic environment for engineers. 
The market is fair enough, for example, if an international student wants to be an intern of some high tech company, he or she will prepare for the interview months before it actually takes place. And the interview itself is not easy, hard questions for how to solving a problem within a fixed time window. Remember, all of those are just interviews for an internship. Nowadays, so many students are stopped at the first step to their dreams because of fierce competition. If we take away the extension rule, can we still proudly say that America is the land of opportunities?
