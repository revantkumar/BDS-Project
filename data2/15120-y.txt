Yuhsuan Wang I support the extension of STEM OPT. Most of STEM jobs are related to technology development or scientific research, which requires longer period to train and work. STEM OPT extension will help F-1 students have sufficient time to practice their learning during advanced degree. If the OPT period is not sufficient, the industry will have negative impact: for the team, they may lose key team members; as for the company, they will have to spend more time and expanse to find new candidates for the position. Please provide F-1 STEM students with more time to have a great contribution in the US.
