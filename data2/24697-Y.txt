I support this new act.

I think one of the fundamental value and strength we have as a country is to attract the best and brightest from all around the world. This new act will help us to continue to do that. Not passing this new act will certainly be a major set back for lots of companies and the States as a whole. We should really be focusing on the big picture, especially considering the extremely low unemployment rate right now.

Thanks for your understanding.
