As an american citizen, I strongly support the proposed rule. STEM OPT extension is a must for the following reasons:
1. Historically, the leadership of our country was built upon our innovation in science and technology. The U.S. has been continuously attracting the brightest talents ensure our edge in the tech sector. Stopping the STEM OPT extension program will do exactly the opposite.
2. America is a country of immigrants and will continue to be so. It's a land of opportunity. If we are to protect our citizens by handing them jobs regardless how lazy and incompetent they are. The country will no longer prosper and the fighting spirit for a better life will be lost. 
3. As far as I concern, STEM OPT program is not a stand-alone program. It's closely associated with the H1B work visa lottery. In the previous years, the chance of winning such a lottery has dropped tremendous due to the loop-hole of the regulations, taken advantage of by certain foreign companies (especially those indian consulting companies). To abandon STEM OPT will result in horrible consequences, as many truly talented foreigners will be forced to leave the country just because of failing to win the visa lottery. 
4. Once we stop the STEM OPT program, we are sending a message to the world that foreign STEM students are not as welcomed as before. This will immediately hurt our higher education industry, when hundreds if not thousands of our schools are depending on the revenue from tuitions paid by foreign students. The damage will be to huge to afford.
I really hope the proposed rule can be passed as expected.
