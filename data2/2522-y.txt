Runxi Chen Dear Mr./Mrs.,

I strongly suggest that the STEM OPT be expanded into 24 months. Here are my reasons:

First, the future of the U.S. is largely dependent on the students studying STEM disciplines. I believe the extension of STEM OPT will provide more opportunities for students of these disciplines to contribute to the economy and education of the U.S. 

Second, I believe this extension is one more step for America to become the land of opportunities for all gifted individuals on this planet. With this extension, they are more likely to unleash their creativity that would otherwise be left unfulfilled in somewhere else. 

In brief, I believe this extension will be a strong boost to the future economy of America and will help fulfil gifted individuals' potentialities. I sincerely hope that this extension will come into existence soon. 

Regards, 
Runxi Chen
