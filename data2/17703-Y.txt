I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal to have OPT extended to 24 months

US is an immgriation country. every year, people with great talents and motivations all around the world, they're willing to come to US and do their own contributions to this country. Remember, that's one of the key drivers to keep US as the leading country in the world, and US will hold this position if we keep the immigration door OPEN.

Please do the right thing, not only to your own interest, but also for the benefits of this great country.

Thanks.

God bless America.
