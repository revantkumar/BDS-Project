As a 30-year software industry veteran and father of an aspiring IT professional, I oppose this rule change. It will flood the market 
with cheaper foreign labor in order to suppress wages. We're already seeing companies lay off experienced IT professionals 
(for a recent example, see Disney) in favor of imported labor. This rule can only accelerate that trend.

This rule will further erode working Americans ability to find good-paying jobs even as we see record numbers of American
workers either unemployed or underemployed.

Do not implement this rule change.
