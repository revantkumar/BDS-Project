Anonymous As An international student in the US and working so hard to get my US degree to get the experience i need in working in the related job. and after working for more than 7 months on OPT, i think it is very critical to extend the OPT time period.
because after all the knowledge and the theories we get at school, working and gaining more experience is the most important knowledge to developed real time skills for beneficial work.

Please extend the opt time for F1 students.
Thank you
