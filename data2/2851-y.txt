Angela Feng I support this rule because:

1. It's US spirit to give everyone equal chances. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.

2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign students to work in US.

3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
