Taewan Kim I strongly support Department of Homeland Security's new proposed rule on OPT STEM extension program for two reasons. 

First, the new proposed rule would benefit U.S. corporation to hire competitive employees in STEM field, which will lead the expansion of corporation and, therefore, more jobs would be created for U.S. residents.

Second, the new rule would benefit universities in U.S. by attracting highly talented international STEM students over the world, which will lead the advance in academic fields and, therefore, U.S. would be remain competitive in science and technology industry.
