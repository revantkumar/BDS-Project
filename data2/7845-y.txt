kenneth lewis I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program this program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
