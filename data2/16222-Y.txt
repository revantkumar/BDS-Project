I support F1 OPT STEM Extension, as it provides a better platform for students to develop a niche skill based on their knowledge earned during school time.

Why I chose to support is based on few key aspects that passes my mind while I think about this:

Dream of pursuing quality higher education starts at a very young age, and there is no better destination than USA to look up to.

In pursuit of dream, when one sets out to achieve them by pursuing a STEM degree, and realizes, practice is what makes the difference to bring all the learning efforts to use, STEM training opportunity fosters that effort.

During the early STEM training period, one realizes that it takes a reasonable amount of time to thoroughly understand the latest STEM technology employed by the organization on different products, and also to understand the company culture and start to contribute to their best.

And this is the time that is really productive to the company, and also the timeline available at this stage provides an individual to take risk and contribute more within the organization, and help come up with innovative products and designs or better quality service.

So, all I want is for everyone to understand its pretty essential to persist with STEM training opportunity and if possible enhance the period.
