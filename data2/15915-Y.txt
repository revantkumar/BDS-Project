I SUPPORT this proposal without any doubt. the reasons are:

1. People always concern that foreign STEM student take over their jobs by lower salary. That is not true. Companies spend on hiring a foreign employee is actually higher than hiring Americans, because of the law demands companies offer at least above average wage for foreign employees. Also, they need more legal support by the company they work for, that cost more spending for their employers.

2. Right now STEM related industries are booming and leading USA out of the previous financial crisis, foreign employers play a important role in this process. They compensate the lack of STEM employee in the job market, and make companies easier to expand their market. All Americans can benefit from better economic situation.
