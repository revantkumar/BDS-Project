The OPT extension rule should definitely be approved. I've read a few of other comments which oppose this rule. I believe they don't understand the real meaning of what they are saying:

Living in San Diego and have an 18 yo son who still cannot find an entry level job anywhere. he has even applied to fast food chains despite feeling uncomfortable working there because he was the only non-hispanic english -speaking youth. Now looking for over 13 months. As a result of the constant rejection he has become quit hopeless and depressed. He is a good kid with morals, polite, well-spoken, integrity, clean-cut, and with good grades. He is giving up because he just does not know what to do anymore to get a break.

-- Being polite and clean-cut won't secure your son a job. Working ability and good education will. Besides, OPT is for students to receive practical training beyond what they've learnt in their major. No STEM student studies "fast food chains" major and compete with your son on these job opportunities.

"This OPT Program must not be expanded. It should be ended completely. It is taking American jobs and giving them to foreign nationals at the expense of American workers. Further, it is robbing the Social Security System and Medicare System of needed income tax revenues. What idiot thought this was a good idea to begin with? It must end!"

-- Students employed under OPT pay the same income tax as US employees. They pay tax to contribute to the US medicare system while not benefiting from it at all, because they are not US citizens. 

"Support education for USA citizens. Support all types of jobs for USA citizens. Let the foreign governments support the education of foreign students. Let the foreign governments provide jobs for their own citizens"

--The United States has been attracting the most talented students to bring productivity, creativity and innovations to its land. The Chinese and Indian government are desperately trying to attract these talents to study
