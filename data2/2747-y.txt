L**** Chen I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

During the study and working time period, foreign students do contribute to the US economy directly andindirectly. From tuition, living expenses, to entertainment and travelling and touring, foreign students boost the the US economy. Studying, researching, innovating new technologies, and creating new products during work are providing benefits to US.

Also the visit of foreign students may introduce more foreign tourists and business visiters to the US and the potential contribution to the US economy can not be ignored.

In addition, cultural impacts and exchanges make both the US colleges/universities and the economy strong in future global competitions. Since people like going to the places that attract them, US should build the environment that attract good students. By contrast, if the OPT was shortened, many prespect students may cancel their plan to study in the US because of lacking of attractions and opportunties in the US economy, which is especially important for STEM major students.

From my own experience:

I have studied Biology, Biomedial Engineering, and Computer Science. Since I value the opportunty much more, I came to study in the US and I got the chances to study in those various fields. If I could not foresee the opportunties, I might stay in my home country.
