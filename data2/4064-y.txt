Irene Zhang I strongly SUPPORT OPT-extension, for the following reasons:

First of all, 12-month training is not sufficient for STEM graduates. Unlike non-STEM majors, STEM-related jobs typically involve longer term projects with technical nature. Therefore, extension allows F1-students to be able to get fully trained and more valuable experience after they return to their home countries.

Secondly, I'm opposed to some comments which claim international STEM students steal jobs from US citizens due to low wages. As far as I know, it usually costs more for the employers to hire non-citizens. Many rules and regulations have minimum wage requirements for international employees. And most F1-students leave US after OPT, unless they are sponsored by the employers for H1B or Green Cards. 

Thirdly, diversity is important for US. I believe US employers won't just hire foreigners just because they're cheap (in fact, they're not cheap). Hiring decisions should be based on talent. If your son/daughter cannot find a job, don't blame foreigners. No offense, but he/she is just not good enough for the job.
