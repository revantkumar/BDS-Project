I strongly support this new rule. As an international student with a STEM degree, I highly understand how much the new OPT extension rule will affect students' decisions in my country of choosing which country to study abroad. 

From my perspective, there are two main reasons that why international students are important. First, international students are a very important component of universities in the United States, which can contribute a large amount of money (e.g. rent, tuition) to the U.S. Second, international students are essential to STEM employers. 

From my personal experience, I got offers from both UK and the U.S. two years ago. A very important factor that affected my decision is that I can have 12 + 17 months to work in the U.S. after graduation. It's important for STEM graduates to have a 2 to 3 years work experience in the U.S., because such high quality work experience will make us more competitive when going back to home country. Thus, students in my country regard OPT as a very important factor to make decision. 

12 month OPT can also provide international students opportunity to accumulate experience. However, it's not enough because many high-tech companies will have training process for new hires, and many projects will be more than 2 years. I just graduated and got my master degree in Computer Science 3 months ago, and got a job offer from an IT company. In my department, there will have a 3-4 months training process. Some new projects in my department are long term and need more than 3 years. It will cost a lot for high-tech companies to train new hires again and again, if these employee can only serve for the company 1 year. 

Some people claim that the extension rule will violate the local labors' market. However, according to my research, the e-verify will prevent such problem. Thus, I believe the new rule will definitely benefit both the U.S. education and job market, and international students.
