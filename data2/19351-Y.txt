I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because this proposal could boom the economy. High-skilled international students have provided one of America's greatest competitive advantages. Their education and skills, their hunger to share in the American dream, their knowledge of world markets, their entrepreneurial drive, and hundreds of thousands of jobs created as a result all have fueled growth in the American economy.
