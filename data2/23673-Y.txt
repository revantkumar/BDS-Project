I strongly agree with the proposal! This will do good to the industry as a whole. In general, more competitions, better industry!

Some people have the misunderstanding that foreigner students make their situation in career worse. Actually this is not the truth. The amount of foreigner students in America compared to citizens is really small. The threat of their career does not come from foreigner studnents. Competitions do good to the whole industry. I had study-abroad experience in England before. They do not give opportunities like OPT to foreigner students but they still have a serious problem of unemployment for their own citizens. The quality of their university education is really not good because of the lack of competitions and this causes a large percentage of unemployment with the graduates.In addition, no guarantee of job opportunities and low-quality education makes England universties less attractive to top foreigner students.

Some people say the OPT program cost a lot of money taken from tax payer. I just want to remind them of that usually foreigner students need to pay the expensive tuition and they are also tax payers! 

In general, the extended OPT programs will have more advantages than disadvantages for the whole economy!
