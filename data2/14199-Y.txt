I support this proposed new rule. 
First, it should be clear that international students are only considered when there is a shortage of QUALIFIED STEM workers among US citizens. Companies will have to do extra paperwork to hire someone who is not a US citizen. It is not a problem for any who is capable of doing that job. It is the problem of American school system esp. public school that causes this chronic shortage. 
Second, international students are, by no means, cheap labor. Yes they are exempt from paying SS tax etc for their first five years after arriving America. But how many years are left to them when they finish their Bachelors (4 years) or PHD's in graduate school (5 years)? They pay high tax after that period! Many of them pay 20%+ or even 30%+ to Federal alone, not to mention State gov't. 
Third, for those students who get a position after graduation, 12 months period is just not enough for them to secure a H1B work visa from a lottery! They will be forced out of the company they work for even if the employers want them. What a pathetic story.
