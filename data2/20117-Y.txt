I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE. And need to argue something.

The STEM students are NOT competing with most American workers. Most jobs these students take are the developer or modeling positions that require advanced quantitative skills, which most American do not enroll in college or graduate studies. Just look at the percentage of foreign students in the STEM majors. Without proper work authorization for the STEM students, most large tech companies will relocate their development department off shore, which is already a trend due to the broken H1-B system. Think about it again for those Americans claiming that STEM students stealing their job opportunities! If there is no attraction to students studying in STEM majors in US, there will be NO reason to place the company offices in US for those large global companies!
