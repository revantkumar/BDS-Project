Docket ID: ICEB-2015-0002, Section C: Cost and Benefits

The benefits outweigh the cost involved in expanding the opportunities for F-1 students. The chance of getting more opportunities for practical training experience will be a big plus for aspiring F-1 students coming to USA. Due to the current rules being not sufficiently accommodating, the current trend for F-1 students has been to pursue their higher education in Europe, which in long term, can have a negative effect on the revenue of US universities. The addition of international students can help to maintain cultural diversity, which can lead to innovative and varied ideas, amongst a vast cultural blend of people in the research and industrial fields, which will help the US economy. I am confident that the controlling regulations put in place with this new rule to ensure that the F-1 OPT students are paid the same salary rates as their US counterparts, and the requirement for employers to give proper on job training to these students, will prevent any potential abuse of this rule.
