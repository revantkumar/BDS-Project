Frank Zhang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First I believe government should take the responsibility let international students to enhance their skills and working ability in United States. Besides, it is also critical for US that foreign workers could provide the jobs which don't fit domestic citizens. Foreign students could promote the economy and create even more jobs, not stealing jobs, but create new jobs for US citizens. I believe this extension could benefit both sides in US.

Second, diversity for US is important and useful. Foreign students and workers could provide different cultures and various aspects to US and make America greater again. With the aid of international students who finish their study, with their skills and knowledge, ability to create and build new technology and inventions, we could make US stronger and better than ever. American dream will restore, people will fulfill their promise and lead a better life. But WITHOUT extension of OPT, none of these will happen. 

I believe the very essence of America is that we all believe in the constitution and american dream as well. We all believe this land of hope and dreams would give everyone a chance to show their knowledge and skills. Extension of OPT is the best way to show real America in which way we believe in. 

I really SUPPORT the proposal and hope the government could hear my voice in such a democratic nation.
