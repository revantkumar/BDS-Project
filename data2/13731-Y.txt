i can not believe there are so many negative comments for this good policy, i notice that most of the opposite opinions are because of the anti-immigrant purpose, i think this is a kind of misunderstanding. for me, a one year graduated out of an university in united states student , who are using the opt working in IT field, i never think about to immigrate to USA, i just want to get more experience other than just got a diploma. normally, the foreign students have to spend one hundred thousand dollar in states for the two years master degree, or double for the four years college education, the cost of the student who is accepting high school education would be even higher. we spend so much money here, of course we want to acquire a certain extend experience, without opt extension, there would be only one year opt term, this is too hard for a foreign student to get even an intern, let alone the full time job, if foreign students can not get any working experience, the university in usa will lose attractiveness to oversea students. In other hand, we are really helping our current team and company, we seize every day when we are working here since we know that we will eventually leave united states, we want to learn more thing, our team also appreciate our performance, if the opt extension get void, hundreds thousands students like me will be kicked out ruthlessly, it would be a big harm for our current company, for my case there is no substitute for my position now, without me the process will be stuck.
