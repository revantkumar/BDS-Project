BOYA YIN I support to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students because of the following several points.
1. Nonimmigrant students with higher educations in the United States should contribute to American society after graduation.
2. These students are paying taxes according to the law.
3. Students with STEM degrees deserve a place in the high-tech sector, so as to inspire more people to make progress, and promote scientific and technological progress.
4. Job market for international students is really bad, many small companies are willing to recruit only US citizens, although there are some big companies are willing to recruit foreigners. However, there are more small companies than big companies. In addition, it is almost impossible that Americans who have professions and abilities can't find a job.
5. International students are not grabbing the working opportunities from Americans. A lot of Americans don't want to work in these area, CS, EE and etc. How many americans are there in the classroom studying the area mentioned above? Is there anybody stops Americans to choose these majors?
6. American spirit encourages people who are motivated, diligent and excellent to get working opportunities, people who are against this rule is against the American spirit.
