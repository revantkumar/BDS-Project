I strongly support this new rule, which actually will benefit the economy, technology and the whole society of the U.S.
All those students enrolled in PhD of STEM areas are smart, hard working and highly devoted to the development of science
and technology in the US. They deserve this new rule to provide them with better opportunities to work and contribute to the US
society and to protect them as employees with high-level education and skills. Besides, most of those students are sponsored 
by Scholarships from the US and it will be a big loss for the US if they are sent back to their own country without contributing
to the US. These students will actually greatly increase the competency of US in the world. I strongly hope that this new rule
on OPT extension can be approved. I even hope that it can be extended to 36 months.
