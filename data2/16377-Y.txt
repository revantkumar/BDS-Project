I support the STEM extension of the Optional Practical Training for the international students, as it provides them an opportunity to gain the required experience in the field of study. There will not be any impact on the American students.
The work opportunities which international students are getting are purely merit based. If one has put the right efforts in the academic study, then American students need not worry about the competition.
