Allen Liu Students, who freshly graduate from schools, are inexperienced. The regular OPT for F-1 international student with STEM degrees is only one year. In this year, students have to find a employer and practice their skill and knowledge in a real world projects or tasks. However, the experience students can get from this one year period is limited. Some company use three month to train their new employees. In order to get experience in any industry, employees need at least one year to start their own career path. The extended time frame in this proposal helps the international students to learn real world experience before they go back to their own country or join US companies. Furthermore, the OPT is an attraction of U.S. colleges and universities, who want to be more competitive in the world. Students want to become more experienced after their studies. The OPT is a good opportunity for them. The longer time students have after their graduate, more attractive for them. 
So I support for this proposal in my own decision.
