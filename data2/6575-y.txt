Lisa Thurmon I am opposed to President Obama's proposal. I have 2 children who are unemployed and looking for jobs. My son is a US Army vet. I have always worked with foreign graduate students as well as researchers. I consider my life enriched because of that, but I don't believe American jobs should be sacrificed for it.
