I strongly support this new rule because it benefits not only STEM students but also the entire US.

First, the OPT-ext rule is an attraction for international students to spend money on US universities. Once abandoned, there is a predictable recession in tourism and education industry because international students can pay less money and spend less time to gain an equal or better educational experience if there in no such an OPT extension rule.

Second, it will benefit US by engaging more educated international work labour. We all know US benefits a lot from its multicultural social formation, especially from highly educated international students.

Third, both statistical data and our experience inform us that most international students work as engineers where they produce much more than they are paid.

In conclusion, I think this new rule is beneficial to both international students and native citizens. Because it will not lower employment rate for US citizens, but will increase the rate by enlivening the economy and creating more jobs.
