Nickie XU The meaning of American dreams and the history of how America strives to become the most powerful country are based on mainly foreigners hardworking. This is a country built by immigrants, by hardworking labors from all over the world. As Pope Francis said, this country is made by immigrants, this country should be friendly with foreigners because their ( citizens) ancestors were foreigners. 

I strongly argue that the new rule of STEM extension would be proved. Nowadays, American companies are in competition with companies all over the world, if Stem students who gradated from top universities, and learned the best skill and knowledge without benefiting the economy of United States, how can this country turn an opportunity into a disadvantage. In total of 6 years available time of stay could let a young profession offers his/her best time of his/her life to create and innovate, even share his/her knowledge with locals. 

I think the benefits of having STEM 24 months extension are tremendously huge. Please support those students and please help America to stay on the top of the world.
