Betty Zhang I think international students deserve to have equal opportunities regarding work. Globalization is an inevitable trend and people who are skilled are supposed to get we they deserve, regardless of nationalities. It's definitely not a good idea to let identity stand in the way. Besides, expanding training opportunities with STEM degrees will do no harm to citizens and will definitely improve the economy. I strongly support that.
