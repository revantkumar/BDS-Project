I strongly support this new OPT extention rule. I'm an international student from China studying mechanical engineering now. I got several offers from universities in UK, Canada and Singapore besides US before I decided to come the states, for the reason of industry training opportunity during school of after graduation. My plan after getting my doctor's degree is to work in industries for a couple of years before finally go back to China. Considered my research experience, my future work is very likely to related to research projects that last 2-3 years, and if during that period my OPT expires and also I lost my VISA, both me and my company will suffer from it. I believe many international students also have this kind of concern. So I hope people will support this rule.
