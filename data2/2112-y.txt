Kurt Priest It's simple. American jobs are for American workers. We need not import others to disenfranchise American workers, especially when those imported workers are in fact, an unknown quality from a security standpoint. Our economy must benifit both American Industry & American workers, and not one to the exclusion of the other. Kurt
