We definitely should approve this regulation. We all know that these students are coming to our country for study first and they mainly major in STEM degrees. They have excellent academic performance and some of them are even masters, PHDs. We don't just kick them out right after they finish their study. This absolutely our US spirit. 

Also, letting them just leave is a serious loss for us. We all agree that the bay area is contributing a lot and playing a huge role in our economy. One of the main reasons that we are still strong and powerful around the world is that we have a lot great tech companies and products like Apple, Facebook, Google. They make a great profit and pay tax so we are rich and powerful. If we let these student coming from famous college having high degree go, for sure our tech companies will be greatly impacted. That might cause a lot troubles and our economy might also be impacted as well. 

If our economy were down due this, there would be less job opportunities for everyone. We all still remember what it was like in 2008 and following years. We suffered a lot; people losing jobs, companies going bankrupt. None of us wants to see this happen again. So we need to ensure our economy stays up.

Letting these students will not affect our job opportunities. In stead, it helps our economy and thus we will have more job opportunities. We definitely should approve this regulation!!
