I totally stay with the new proposal with the purpose to extend longer cap for F-1 student. 
I'm a PhD student from China and will graduate soon. I'm financially supported by the school (essentially taxpayers) as a research assistant. In 6 years of PhD, taxpayers roughly spent $30,000*6 on me excluding the investment of research spending. This is a huge amount of money, and I get free higher education and training. Morally, if the community supported me, I should do something to bring some benefit back to the community. One year work of OPT is far from giving my knowledge back to the community.
As long as the taxpayers heard they've spent $180k on a foreign student, I don't think they wanna send me home instead of serving the United States.
I'm Chinese and China is a rapidly growing emerging country. The higher education will definitely help me find a good position in China. Therefore, I don't think I have to stay in the United States to live a better life. To be honest, United States should do something to help these well-trained graduate student stay here and make the community better. These well-trained elites including me will for sure bring high-tech and more tax to America. 
why reject the people who can bring more benefits to the United States?
Besides the 24 months of OPT extension, I also think United States should reform the immigration law to help the elites stay here.
