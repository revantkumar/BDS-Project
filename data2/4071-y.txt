Amar Zavery, Microsoft Corporation Please don't let the students go from the US. These students contribute immensely to the US economy and make US a better place to live. US still remains a land of opportunities because of its open immigration policies towards international students. Most of these students on F1-visa work for Fortune 500 companies or create a startup that turns into a Fortune 500 company that eventually creates more jobs in the US. Either increase the H1-B quota limit or provide these students more time in the US so they can achieve their dreams.
You always hear this statement now a days that "students in countries like India and China are honing their Math, Science and English skills are getting more competitive". What makes them better at this? It is the primary and high school teachers in those countries. Bring those teachers to the US. They will work harder to impart those skills to the children in the US. All this is possible by an open and a better immigration policy.
