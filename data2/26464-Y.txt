As an American Citizen, I received my master's degree in Engineering department, where lots of my fellows, not attending the graduate college would not deem it necessary to get a higher degree as the job market was relatively easier for them to get a job right after graduation. I also heard from the department business office that the graduate application ratio between Americans and Internationals are decreasing in recent years. I wouldn't blame the foreigners taking a job if you are not determined to get more consolidated knowledge base, especially in the related STEM disciplines. And I do believe this policy would bring in strong talented people, as I have been working with international team mates, who are really smart team players, and the competition in a more open environment instead of sightless protection would help growth eventually.
