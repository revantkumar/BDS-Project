Kangwan Zheng I am a STEM student in Computer Engineering. I paid 16K tuition for my graduate study each semester, and expect to work in US after I graduate. Now if OPT extension is cancelled, I can only work 1 year at best, assuming if there is any company that is willing to hire a 'short-term' employee.

I think there will be fewer foreign students going to US to study, leading universities lack of funds. Do you really think this is a good option?
