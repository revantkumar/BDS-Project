Anonymous Anonymous I oppose this OPT EXTENSION PLAN

29 STEM OPT PERIOD is enough for those who wanna seek opportunities. If in first 29 months they cannot seize a chance, then more 7 month cannot offer any help just delay of the game. 

Also, the non-stem opt is only given 12 months, so I think the stem should be 12 also, coz stem majors students are apparently easier to get a job than those who major in non-stem ones. For those international students, they pay also similar amount of money over the US to get a degree, especially most of time the non-stem majors are barely win a scholarship or TA assistant chance than STEM major students. Thus, they should be equal to give the same period of time to stay in the US to get a job. I think that Non-stem should extent a little bit more but STEM, keep it in 12 months is enough.
