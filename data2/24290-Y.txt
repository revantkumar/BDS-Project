To whom it may concern,

I strongly support the new 24-months OPT extension rule. Here I want to dispute those arguments of negative comments:
Foreign Students take away jobs and do not pay tax: foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX and they help local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge loss. Those property renting, food service and other industries will face huge loss. Foreign student come to US for 2-year degree will contribute will contribute $200000.00 with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other cost. These money comes from the foreign students themselves not scholarship. Actually, scholarship for foreign students in 2-year degree is not common. So $200000.00 X 400000 students= total$80000000000.00 contribute to US economy.
With the new 24 months STEM extension, students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00). Total Benefit to US Economy Benefit in the range of $ 83600000000 for 5 years.

Why not invest in US students more instead of recruiting foreign students: there is no guarantee how long it will take and how much it will cost to train all US students to fully compensate loss of foreign students if we cancel the OPT program and the STEM extension rule. Since the truth is the majority of students who study in STEM in US universities are international students, especially in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering area.

There is no shortage of US students in STEM: Quantity does not mean quality. There are also a huge number of foreign students in STEM but only a very small proportion of them can pass the strict interviews and finally get a job by US companies. 
To be honest, there is point to say international student is being treated better, I strongly doubt how is this point coming from? With OPT and STEM extensile rule, international students just be treated to a
