As an international Student in Computer Science major, I realized one fact is that: we don't steal jobs from citizens, because there're not that much qualified engineers in US for the hot market. 

I have seen so many approaches and events trying to encourage local people learning programming and finding a good job, like videos from President Obama, Bill Gates to even NBA play Chris Bosh, but most people seem not interested in such kind of job. The reason why STEM students are welcomed but the other majors not is for non-stem areas, you can find enough local employees so that you don't need to hire foreign students. But for STEM, a company prefer pay more to hire a qualified international student to hire a local unqualified people, I think it's reasonable.
