I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who graduated from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. That's why US is the strongest country in the world.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. This is how innovation happens.
