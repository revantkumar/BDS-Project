Yuanxing Wang I fully support this proposed OPT extension rule for STEM. The reasons are:
1. More benefits to colleges and universities in the U.S.
The extension policy for STEM OPT will absolutely attract more students to study in the U.S. STEM related fields. More international students will increase cultural diversity, increase the competitiveness of the school's academic, and increase school revenues in the U.S.
2. More benefits to U.S. employers and economy
With the recovery of economy, high-tech companies need more talented STEM students, but currently the U.S. national graduates may not be able to meet all these demands. If STEM OPT not extended, companies will be more difficult to recruit talented STEM students, the formation of the U.S. economic recovery may be affected.
3. OPT extension will not affect the U.S. workers job opportunities
The U.S. law rules that students must do major-related work during their OPT, and these STEM jobs are lower proportion for U.S. citizens, thus it does not affect the employment structure of U.S. citizens. Instead, OPT extension will attract more STEM students in the United States. In a long-term perspective, it will promote economic development, and thus create more jobs in the U.S.
Based on these arguments, this proposed OPT extension rule is good for the U.S. and international STEM students.
