I strongly SUPPORT this rule because: firstly lots of the international students are excellent talents in their area, and when they are educated in US, they not only bring financial benefits to the universities, but also have chance to make huge contributions to the US. This rule gives them the chance. Secondly, the immigrant-friendly culture in US brings talents all over the world to US, which is beneficial for US economy.
