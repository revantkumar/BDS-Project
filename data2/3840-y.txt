John W I strongly support to extend opt for the following reasons. 

1. Many high tech companies is depending on international student as engineer, developer, researcher etc. it is obviously they would have a big problem if no international could work there.

2. Having some working experience is very important. It should be a part of education.

3. There is a growing hates to foreigners in u.s which I feel should be treated with more attention. Why would people hate foreigners? Does international student really jeopardize their job opportunity? I don't think so. There are restrictions on opt, and fees to descrimate hiring international student. My employer clearly states that if he could find a u.s citizen he will not hire international worker. There are jobs need trained and specialized worker and not all American know how to do it.
