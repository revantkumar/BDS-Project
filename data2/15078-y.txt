Karthik Penemesetty Firstly US is providing great opp for int'l students to learn at finest univs across the world. We thankyou heart fully for that. We would also like to work in sectors which is shaking the world(US tech sector/ US health dept/ US research). No country has invested so much on these fields. Having just 1 year opportunity will not enable us to get deeper understanding of processes in these domains. Hence OPT extension will be good option. A non American resident is never a threat for Americans in securing a job. Sometimes it's a disadvantage for int'l students only. As the H1B process is getting more competitive with more and more applicants, having an OPT EXTENSION is ideal for the students who are willing to prove to the world with the new skillsets they acquired using their OPT extension. We all know US never turns down on anyone who wants to cherish a bright dream. We all thankyou for all the support US govt has given us so far and we trust in the govt that OPT EXTENSION will be back.
