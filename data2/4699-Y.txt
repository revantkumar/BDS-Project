As a prospective STEM student, I strongly support this rule. While it is obvious why I make such decision, I want to share my idea of why someone who is not a STEM student should agree with such a rule. Of course one condition is that this someone I am trying to persuade really cares about the United States, and have a rational mind. First of all, I think there's no drawback of this rule. One would argue that this will lead to more immigrates. And yes, it is possible. But why is that a problem? United States is built by immigrates and such idea is literally against the Constitution. Secondly, some argue this kind of rule will make the US citizenship worth less. To be honest, the value of a citizenship does not come from the identity itself, it came from the power of the country, which is built by hard-working, intelligent people who create value, not those who doing nothing but complaining.
