I support this proposal.

It is undeniable fact that STEM students have made great contributions to the country. It's terribly unwise to let students who receive good education in US to go back to their home country and compete against US. I think the need for OPT extension to a large extent results from limited quota of H1B visa. In fact I believe US should open more H1B quota to retain more people with high degree, talented mind, and the willingness to contribute to stay and work in the country.
