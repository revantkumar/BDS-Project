I strongly support the proposal because expanding training opportunities for F1 students attracts more talented people from all over the world to attend American colleges. Getting enough training opportunities is an essential part of students' educational experiences.

Besides, international students contribute to America's economy. They are consumers who have to buy cars, houses, and other relatively expensive commodities.
