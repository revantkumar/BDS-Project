I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities.

I believe the STEM extension should be further extended to all US graduate degrees, including MBA's, JD's, and PhD's.

There is tremendous talent coming out of graduate programs that is lost due to the inability to extend F-1 OPT.
