I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, many great scientist are international student before they got great creations.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. There are barely no international student compete with US citizn's job with a low salary. And competition will improve every one's ability in US.
