I strongly support the new policy! The United States of America is a country built up on innovation, technology, and creation. Extended OPT enables well trained STEM students to contribute their knowledge and effort working on new technologies and research topics for the companies, who make the United States lead the technology and innovation in the world. It is a great loss for those companies and students who already been working on projects to seize the progress.
