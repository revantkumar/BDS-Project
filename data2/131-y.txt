A.C Anonymous I support OPT extensions because it will only benefit the US economy as a land of diversity. Think about industry leaders such as Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai, they were not born in the US. People who are born in the US should work harder and become more competitive instead of complaining about rising minimum wages. Highly skilled foreign workers are in high demand and they have nothing to do with driving down the wages. Since when Americans start become close-minded?
