It seems to me that with the sagging employment conditions in America for the last few years, that this is not the time for bringing in and or training foreign workers if the goal is Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, would be preferable, as opposed to using the resources we have to train foreign students. It is a world crisis indeed but destroying our economy and the future of our young men and women trying to find gainful employment, will not help others and will certainly hurt Americans.

When America prospers it seems that everyone prospers, turning off the flow of a potential prosperity here in the US is definitely not a step forward, but in fact a backward one for Americans and no advantage for anyone else.

Americans are feeling fragile and the bureaucracies in our country is not lending itself to strengthening the position of our citizens. I urge you to tighten the rules and save the country as I believe that the 2016 elections will create a whole new view of how to fix what is most definitely broken.
