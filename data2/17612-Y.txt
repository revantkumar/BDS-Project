I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. Absorbing talents from all over the world is one of the most crucial reasons for the United States to stay energetic and powerful.

2. This policy will attract more international students to American colleges, which brings great economic benefits to the United States. 
According to the records from NAFSA:
"The 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to 2014 NAFSA findings. This is a 8.5% increase in job support and creation, and a nearly 12% increase in dollars contributed to the economy from the previous academic year."

3. All men are created equal. Let capability be the selection criterion and let us make a healthy job market.
