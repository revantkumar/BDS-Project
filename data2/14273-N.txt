STOP increasing this visa to 36 months. We have enough trouble with American students paying for college and even 
getting into a decent college. 
Start to look at needs of Americans now! YOu are over loading us with people in college that are not
citizens, who get to much on the welfare system and our own people are going with out.

I am a senior citizen and see things going down hill in my life as SS is not enough to live in and our
Clountys no longer have some of the services we use to get. Cant afford food that I am on special
diets for , diabetes and heart problems 
It would be nice to get some help to eat properly and not have Blood sugars out of control
and blood pressure high due to the cost of salt free food. I can not afford it

Try to think of us elders and also the Children of this country that need help!! 

CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW??????
