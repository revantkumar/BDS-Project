I like the Opt-extension rule.
The US provides 17 months opt-extension rule. That is the reason that I chose to study in the US 2 years ago. My friends and I had several choices. But we all decided to study in the US. We believe the US is open, fair society. We believe we could get in touch with the greatest students from all over the world. The opt extension is the biggest reason we are here. It the extension is canceled, we can only work 12 months here. It is too short to finish a project. Normal projects need to take 2~3 years. If the owner of the project has to go back to his country, there would be a lots of tech debts left behind. Too short opt makes no sense. Neither the students could learn some thing they want, nor they could make a contribution to local companies. So students need longer opt. That is why I strongly support this new rules.
