Gisela Olmsted I strongly support the OPT-extension since it does have many benefits for our country.
Firstly, the proposed changes is directly related to US colleges and universities and will definitely help them remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study. Without this ruling, there would be a great shrinkage in the number of international students who are willing to come to our country, since most of them are hoping to be able to apply what they have learned in class and gain more real-world industry experience, when they choose a university. Instead, they would bring CASH to other welcoming countries. 
Additionally, as US citizen, I dont think we have to worry about we will lose our jobs at all. First, this rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US. And OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry. Second, as we all know, US tech companies definitely would like to choose US citizens rather than international students if they are the same qualified. It is unreasonable and should not be supported that those who dont have the necessary skills but just blame F1 students for taking their jobs. Even all the international students left after graduation, companies would rather hire them overseas than hire those poor-qualified. 
It is true that international students participation in the job market would increase competition in the short term. However, in the long run, competition will definitely increase efficiency and creativity, accelerate development and benefit us all. In todays world, all countries are experiencing a very fast advancement, like China, Japan, Europe,etc. In order to remain our leadership, We should take measures to keep those talented people devoting to our scientific research and high-tech development, instead of pushing them away. So, do not let the temporary irrational fear completely ruin our true benefits at all.
