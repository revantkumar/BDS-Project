Einstein was an immigrant. Von Neumann was an immigrant. It was the immigrants with their talent, knowledge and diligence that built such a magnificent country from scratch. It is the love of liberty and the strive for happiness that constituted the core value of America, the recognition of America is not rooted in biological relationship or geographical relations, but the universal value, of which freedom and acceptance of competition is an indispensable part. 

In late Warring States period of China, Qin emerged as a superpower and finally unified China because it was the only kingdom where a talent with humble birth could be recognized based on his contribution. If US is to maintain her position in the world, it is a wise choice for her to be more friendly to immigrants with professional knowledge.
