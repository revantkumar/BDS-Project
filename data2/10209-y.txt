Jia Li The additional OPT time will provide international students more opportunities to contribute to American industry and society after they gain excellent education from qualified US universities. For most students in STEM majors, US universities provide full scholarship to help them finish their study, it doesn't make sense to just let them go after they graduate and contribute for US's competitors.

If it's easy for company to find qualified US workers, then companies would definitely hire US workers, however, it's pretty difficult for many high tech companies to hire enough US workers with science and technology background. As is known, great talent are greatest asset. It would be a huge advantage for US if US can keep the talent foreigners work and contribute for the country. In this situation, if students go back home after they get great education in US, it would be a big loss for US's future. In other words, if it's hard for the high tech companies like Facebook, Google to hire qualified workers, they may relocate their companies or offices to India, China or Canada. It will end up losing a lot of employment opportunities at home.

I strongly support the OPT extension policy, which is not only necessary for the economy but also for the countries' future.
