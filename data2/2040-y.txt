Angela Hou I strongly support the OPT Extension for STEM students.
First, the opinion that the foreign students take the jobs from the American citizens is groundless. Each year the job opportunities available to foreigners are limited. In 2014, the overall foreign-born persons in the U.S. labor force only accounts for 16.5% of the total, and the OPT STEM students occupies even less than 5% of the total percentage. The extension of OPT will not threaten the job opportunities for American citizens at all, since the STEM student is a very small portion. 
Second, it's American's spirit to give everyone the equal chance to pursue their goals. For those talented STEM students, they have the same chance as Americans to work in US legally. More importantly, in most high-tech companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Tesla in silicon valley, the STEM students work very hard and contribute a lot to the specific high technical areas. The American employers also benefit from that. 
Third, the OPT extension will attract more talent foreign students to come to study in the US, and contribute themselves to the nation after graduation. They will bring their passion, intelligence, and creativity to the United States.
