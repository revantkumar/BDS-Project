I know many of my fellow americans will object to this rule but I feel that its fair to the international students who in fairness are not just intelligent but also hard working. I would much rather hire a person who has pursued education in the US than a person who moved directly for work. No wonder all the organizations find ways to hire them. This would make it simple for these organizations and save them millions in Visa fees, not to mention the positive impact this will have on the education sector and the economy as a whole.
