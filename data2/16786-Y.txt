I strongly agree that OPT extension should be kept for the following reasons:

1. STEM fields are essential for the development of technology! USA needs a larg amount of people who devote themselves to these fields, which help USA to stay No. 1 in world-wide. The supply of citizens can not cover the demand of technical personnel.
2. Competition is the reason why USA is the No.1 all over the world! It's always not good to compromise the competition environment!!!
