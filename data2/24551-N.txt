I STRONGLY OPPOSE this new expanded program. It is absolutely nuts to hire foreign students while leaving Americans without jobs, and in debt for their education. Not only that, but these foreign students will NOT be paying into the social security program at all. This leaves the Social Security system deeper in the hole than it already is.

THIS PROGRAM MUST BE STOPPED!!!! NOW!!!
