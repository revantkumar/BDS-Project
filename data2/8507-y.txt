Steven Leng Support the proposal!

A blooming, prosperity and strong US in economy, culture, science and technology since it established, especially since WWII has been highly benefitted and relied on contribution of intellegence from various countries of the would.

Why so many genius and intellegent, international young students going to universities in US? Why so many outstanding scientists, engineers, economists and artists from different countrirs working in US? It was because of the open, diversity, tolerate, policy of US in welcoming and attracting the intellegence, of course including high tech people and STEM students from the world.

If US turning down the proposal and turning back the open policy, it will hurt the enthusiasm of international STEM students and their parent. It will decline the willingness of international STEM students going to US universities. It will push the intellegent youth to other countries, i.e. the copmetitors of US. Conseqently it will damage US economy, competitive power and US citizen's life quality.
