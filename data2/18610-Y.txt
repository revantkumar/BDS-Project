I strongly support the proposed rule for two reasons:

1. International students, coming from different countries pursue Higher education in the US because of various reasons, one of which is the great education system of US. Students are exposed to state of art technologies, where they can practice theoretical concepts and work with equally competitive peers. As soon as they graduate, most of the students prefer to work for the industry, where they get a chance to expose themselves to practical implementations of theoretical concepts. Industry needs talented people to work for them, and talent can easily be honed at Universities because of the academic ambience and the diversity it offers. Not all countries have the cutting edge infrastructure and technologies that US has. If international students do not get a chance to practice whatever they learnt in a School, I don't think they'll opt US as a destination for higher education.

2. Industries in US work in close collaboration with Educational Institutes to develop cutting edge technologies, which is the future of US. Most of the international students will stop coming to US, if they do not find any prospects after higher education. In that case, innovation driven industry which works with the Educational Institutes will be short of talented pool. This will eventually affect US economy. It neither benefits the students or the US, leading to a lose-lose state.

Again, based on my reasoning I would strongly support OPT stem extension.

Thanks!
