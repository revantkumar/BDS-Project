Without the OPT program, the student would find it difficult to pursue a job in his/her home country after graduation which is counterproductive to the purpose of the education. A certain amount of industrial experience (12 months) is quite reasonable to this end. The extension is required in some cases of more complicated fields such as STEM, where it takes longer to gain the required amount of experience in order for the student to be competitive in the job market of that field. This also facilitates international talent to the workforce and the industry and economy benefit by the varied perspectives brought by the international worker, which is part of the intent of this program. All this also provides a greater incentive to attract international talent, thus providing a win-win for both the international student and the U.S. economy.
Thus the OPT program should be recognized as a benefit and should be retained.
