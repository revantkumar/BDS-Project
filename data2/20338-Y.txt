Hello,

Thanks for bringing up this rule, there are lot of students whose 17 months OPT period is going to end by end of October and 1st week of November, i'm one among them.

Please try to help us by publishing something by end of October, else give us an option to apply for this and validate it later, so that we will have an opportunity to stay here in this country.

This is humble request from all the students whose OPT is ending this October or 1st week of November.
