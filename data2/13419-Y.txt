I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons.

Firstly, there is always a big gap between academic program and industrial experience. New graduates from STEM majors generally knows little about real stuffs used in the companies. The courses taught by professors just show you the principle or the upper-level idea of how things work, and the projects they have done in university are simple and of small scales. There are so much more out of university for international students in STEM major to learn from industry to build a solid background, and be prepared for their career life. One years OPT is not enough because most of projects need at least several months, and OPT STEM extension is necessary for international students to REALLY understand what they have learned in university and how to use them in the companies. Without OPT STEM Extension, studying in the US will become a less and less appealing choice for international students.

Secondly, OPT is not H1B! Please make sure OPT is just for non-immigration F-1 Visa. If some US citizens think their job opportunities are losing, could they apply STEM programs in universities as well? As far as I know, the job market is never fair between a US citizen and an international student.
