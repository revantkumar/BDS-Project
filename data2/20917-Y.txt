I strongly support expanding OPT for F-1 Nonimmigrant students. And there is a lot of misunderstandings in the comments. 

First of all, the OPT extension does no harm to domain workers. OPT requires a student working as a professional that directly related to his/her study field. For example, a statistics student CANNOT work as a veterinary. That is to say, students CANNOT steal jobs from all Americans. Besides, foreign students are NOT cheap labors, we are not stealing jobs from Americans by getting lower wages. Most of us are studying as graduate students, we're seeking opportunities that can maximize the utilization of our skills, and I believe these opportunities are very valuable. Even though we want to accept lower wedges, as I stated earlier, we are not allowed to do jobs that are irrelevant with our fields. 
Finally, I as a graduate student who is sponsored by the US government, am very thankful for this kindness. I really hope I could stay here and make little but meaningful contributions to this country.
