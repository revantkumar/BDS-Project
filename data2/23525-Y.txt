It's good to give more opportunities to foreign students. I'm american and I have two houses near the University of Washington. I can say that in these years, I have no worry to rent my houses to the students here because more and more foreign students has chosen the University of Washington. They have money. I'm living on the rent of the houses. If they were all kicked out, I can live on nothing.
