I totally support the new rules on OPT STEM extension. 
The purpose of F1 visa is for the international student to have a legal status to learn knowledge at the US, and the learning process should not only include the academic study, but also includes how to apply those knowledge into practical real-world project. As an international student specified in civil engineering, a lot of my friends and classmates who are also international students in the field of engineering, as well as myself, have been learning advanced knowledges, taking classes that are related to our field of study, and after graduation, the best way to apply our knowledge into practical, is to find a job in high-tech companies, here in the US. Compared to other types of jobs, the engineering jobs requires more technical skills and the life cycle of the tasks and projects is longer and require more time for the engineers to get familiar with new methodologies and tools. Thus, extending the OPT period for engineering students could let us have more time to exposure to the new technologies, learn deeply and contribute ourselves better to the projects and tasks. For us, these experiences will build up knowledge map and become valuable when we go back to our country and start new career. For the US, the revenue that those high-tech companies make, could eventually help to improve the economy in the US, which will become a beneficial cycle, and generating more jobs for the US citizens as well. So in conclusion, I think extending OPT period is mutually beneficial for both our international students and US.
