This extension will be a great thing and i strongly support it. this will help students to gain good practical experience. This will also benefit the organizations, since they would have a talented workforce at their hand. This would benefit both the parties involved (organization and students) and the country as a whole. This would also act as a welcoming sign for future students around the world.
