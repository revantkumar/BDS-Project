This is a big step that shows how valuable STEM students from accredited US Universities are in shaping the next generation technology and advancements. They play an important role, however small it might be, in taking the development of a great nation, and the world as a whole, to the next level. If this rule wasn't put into place quickly, US would lose a large section of skilled workers to other competitive nations, not just in the short term, but in the long term as well - as many students would realize that they are not really wanted here. I feel, DHS did the right thing since the companies based in the US will continue to have their options open, and I would like to thank them for bringing this in time.
