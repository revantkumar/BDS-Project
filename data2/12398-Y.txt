I highly recommend US government give pass to this proposal. Once stop STEM OPT, the economics in the US is going to be harmed tremendously. If you all depends on US citizens and want to make the prosperity of US, it is not going to happen. Those who blame their not getting a job on STEM OPT, are losers. You don't get a job because of yourself, because you are stupid or because you don't have the ability. Fairness of competence should always be stressed in this country of freedom.
