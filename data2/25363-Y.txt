I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Since the student learned most of the knowledge from the universities in U.S., the government should let them keep making contributions to the U.S. 

2.U.S. is a diversity country, many of the great works have done in the past years includes the contribution of international students. So OPT can provide them a chance to contribute what they learn to their work or research in the U.S.

3. Though competition does exist between domestic students and international students, but it is not a bad thing. International students actually didn't compete with domestic student with lower payments. Some positions just couldn't find the proper domestic students. So overall, competition can help the U.S. to choose proper employees and improve everyone's level and improve the competitiveness of the U.S. in the whole world.

For those reasons above, I strongly support this proposal!
