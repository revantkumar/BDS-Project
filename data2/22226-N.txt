I am very disappointed that the president has again chosen foreign/policy over his own people of America!. After incurring tens of thousand of school
debt my son was not able to find a job that would support him! This is truly a sad state of affairs for all Americans. 
Needless to say his loans are in deferment until he is able to afford to begin to repay them, while they are growing daily with 
the interest they are accruing .
SHAMEFUL THAT OBAMA IS EVEN CONSIDERING PROMOTIN THIS WHILE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
4YOUNG AMERICANS ARE DROWNING IN STUDENT DEBT,
I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of
payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these 
companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when
they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to
find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
