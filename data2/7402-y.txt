Nadja Adolf The United States graduates two to three times as many citizen and legal resident STEM graduates as there are jobs to receive them. No study has ever found a shortage of US STEM workers; in fact, most US STEM graduates do not work in STEM fields as they cannot find employment. The reality is that in hiring foreign workers employers avoid certain payroll and other taxes. In some cases the government even *subsidizes* foreign national workers in preference to American workers.

The downward pressure on STEM wages can be seen in high technology, where wages have not risen since 2000. I have trained other people's and even my own replacement as the law permits US employers to fire American workers and hire foreign workers as long as the foreign workers are paid $60,000 per annum.

This law will only make matter worse. It also further discourages American youth from studying STEM fields. High school students are very aware of the trend to replace US workers with foreign workers.

My nephew decided to abandon STEM after watching his father and uncle repeatedly be replaced by foreign workers. The girl across the street also decided to study another area seeing this happen to people in our neighborhood. Many young people have decided to seek training suitable for civil service work - public administration, etc. - instead of STEM. In our area everyone is very aware that the American engineers are unemployed and the new H1-B neighbors have their old jobs.
