RYAN JOHN I strongly support the proposed OPT program along with the amendment to extend the OPT program for STEM students (by 24 months) for the following reasons:-

a. Work Experience Post completion of education, it is during the OPT period that students have the opportunity to apply the skills that developed during the educational program. At the end of the day, it is this work experience that ultimately trains a student to cope with the rigors of the industry and its stiff demands.

b. Employment of students on OPT to organizations could mean one of the 2 cases 
i. There is a deficit in skilled labor or eligible candidates for the position advertised, which is why the company is compelled to hire students as the demand in the sector isn't probably met by the local workforce.
ii. The candidate recruited stands out in opposition to other applicants (native American or other international students ) which is why they are recruited.
In either case, one cannot argue that the OPT program encourages employers to hire immigrants. As we all know that hiring immigrants have their own problems with regard to VISA status / sponsorship amongst other issues. In fact, the OPT program and its extension, would help employers retain talented individuals who could help the organization grow.

c. An international student on OPT is eligible to beings taxed (maybe excluding two) the same way as an American citizen, so international students contribute to the growth of the economy.

d. Innovative students would be denied the opportunity to implement ideas maybe as a start-up, joint-venture or by other means which is like eliminating creativity and innovation.

e. Lastly, the proposed OPT legislation contains sufficient provisions to safeguard the interests of American workers especially by discouraging organizations / enterprises from laying off a native American worker in favor of an immigrant on OPT.
