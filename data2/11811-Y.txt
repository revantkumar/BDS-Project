It's ridiculous to see people commenting that OPT makes U.S. citizenship worthless and less competitive. It is well known that immigrants make tremendous contribution to American's cultural and economical growth. Retrospectively, America can not achieve today's success without the endeavor of immigrants. In this sense, immigrants are the very reason that keeps America strong and let all Americans feel proud of being a part of this country. Secondly, competition makes excellence. Without competition, one will lose target, country will be backsliding. Immigrants promote challenges and at the meantime influence people around to work harder and contribute more. This undoubtedly makes America more competitive.

OPT plays a critical role here. Most immigrants are once college students in U.S. Without OPT extension, they will most probably lose the opportunity to work and contribute in U.S. under the current regulation(one time H1-B lottery). Therefore, I strong SUPPORT the OPT extension.
