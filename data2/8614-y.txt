Yun Qu, Xilinx Research Labs I strongly agree with the approval of this policy. The US bases its foundation on thousands of immigrants to build this country day and night; this has not been changed for two hundred years. It would be detrimental to decline the OPT extension. 

First of all, expanding OPT does not make it harder for US people to get the jobs. Compared to International students, the US citizens have all the advantages to get whatever jobs they want.

Secondly, the fact is, there are not enough engineers in this country. Without enough engineers, it would be extremely hard to make technology advance, which would in turn hurt the recovering economy. It would also be quite harmful to push away experienced engineers to other countries; this should be considered as a significant loss to the US. In this case, expanding OPT is definitely beneficial to this country.

Another harm of declining the OPT extension is that, a lot of STEM Ph.D. students will have to go back to their countries without the OPT extension. The US government has spent millions of tax payer's money on these talents; losing them is clearly not only defeating the purpose of our current system, but also scaring millions of future candidates away. The US people don't want to see the government spends their tax dollars in support of other countries.

In summary, I vote yes for the extension of the OPT program, not only because this would not do any harm to the US, but also because it is going to be a win-win situation to both sides. Without this extension, the US can lose money by denying talented workers. Please do not shut down the freedom to competition.
