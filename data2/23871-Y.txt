I support STEM extension for 24 months after the OPT period. I appreciate the proposed rule since it benefits both students and most importantly the country. On the flip side, it would be a big blow to the students and the country if there is no STEM extension. Students from all other countries are competent enough and have supported for the growth of economy.
