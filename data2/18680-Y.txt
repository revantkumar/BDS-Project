I strongly support the extension. 
My opinion is based on the following considerations: 
1. Social justice and equity is one of the most important American spirit. OPT legally gives international students equal rights to apply knowledge they learnt in school, contributing to US and gaining working experience, which is a win-win situation. 
2. Foreign students admitted to top schools in the States are talented, and hard working. American schools further advance their ability, and OPT gives them more time to repay to American society. 
3. OPT time is appreciated as part of US education package. Top foreign students came to the states as american schools not only provide excellent education, but also real-world practice opportunities. Extending OPT time adds to value of the real-world practice, and adds to attraction of US schools.
4. Employers of the students will also benefit from the extension, as they won't loss qualified employees after one year. All new employees need to be trained to be more competent to positions, it will be a huge loss of employers if all foreign talented students get trained and leave a few months afterwards.
