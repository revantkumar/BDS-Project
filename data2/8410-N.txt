It appears to most Americans that the Bureaucrats in DC and the "conditionally educated" young people with barely enough wisdom to think for themselves can do so logically, prioritize the major issues or do any research on what the true problems are in this country. Many who agree or are apathetic to our bowing to our enemies while ignoring the true populace and the military is certainly not making it.
This proposed rule is just another example of the overused and worthless phrase; "politically correct". Let's not take away from those of us who truly need that which there is very little left in this country, that being our money, albiet our financial and monetary system. Fiscal irresponsibility is what Congress is showing it does best to promote. Please show that you still care about our Constitution and honest Americans and less about spending what we don't have.
