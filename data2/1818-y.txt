Shirley Paulsen, NumbersUSA Stop the Expansion of the Optional Practical Training Program.
* The Freedom of Information Act tells us OPT denied US workers more than 430,000 jobs during 2009-2013 & removed 4 billion from Social Security & Medicare trust funds.
* Ian Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute. "like other employment visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class."
* DHS doesn't want to protect US workers, US students are excluded from this privileged program.
*Visa is open to every foreign person in the world regardless of ability to succeed at a US school. This regulation is not looking for educated students.
Even includes high school students.
*Regulations fail to impose penalties for violation of the regulations for employers or student fraud.
*Numerous FBI reports stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI doesn't have enough field agents to keep tabs on them.
*If there is a STEM workers shortage and the foreign student is educated why does the students need training and why not include Americans if there's a shortage.
*Companies abuse visa programs, they only want young cheap labor, can avoid payroll tax, and are offered a substantial bonus for hiring an alien college grad rather then an American.
*There are numerous laws been violated here. This visa program has far to many flaws. I'm sure my comments only address a few problems.
