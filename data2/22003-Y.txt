I strongly support this proposal as I believe this come bring more vigor to US economic development and at the same time makes US more competitive especially in hi-tech area.

To begin with, lots of hi-tech undergoing projects in US are supported by huge amount of international graduates who are making significant contribution to the US science and technology development. Those projects usually have duration longer than 2 years and therefore a properly extended OPT session can greatly help the punctual completion of the projects. Taking myself as an example, I will be joining a leading investment bank to conduct anti-market manipulation project, this project is of vital importance to the healthy development to the US financial industry especially post the financial crisis. As far as I know, majority of the projects under this anti-market manipulation have durations longer than 2 years and half of the team are international students. This demonstrates how important a properly extended OPT can help the rebuild of US financial industry.

In addition, the extended OPT session can attract more international students to US for higher education and this can greatly create huge amount of economic benefit such as growth in rental income, restaurant income and tourism. This can in turn creates more job opportunities in US.

There is no denying that existence of OPT indeed create more employment possibilities for international student and hence more competition in the job market. However, it is indeed the competition that makes US staying ahead of the other countries in terms of hi-tech development. Competition stimulates US citizens to be more proactive acquiring the necessary skills and eventually benefit US society as a whole.
