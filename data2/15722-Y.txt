I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. 
But considering the number of applications for H1B visa, it would be better if the extension was 36 months. 
I believe this increased duration of practical training is imperative for students to fully utilize the education they received and 
also provide excellent employees for US companies. Please check the attached file out for detailed reasons.
