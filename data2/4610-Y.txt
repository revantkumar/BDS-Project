I'm strongly agree with this rule, following is my reason:
1. It has a positive effect on US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US, which will increase the education level of US.
2. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented foreign students who come to US for study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.
