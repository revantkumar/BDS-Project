Strongly support this new rule! Obviously it can bring more great scientists and engineers to the U.S. Why not?

Some people think OPT will result in cheap foreign labors and then take out job opportunities of American. I totally don't agree with it. All STEM OPT students have at least bachelor degrees or even higher and lots of them are hired by high-tech companies in silicon valley, Texas and NYC. 

I know some of STEM OPT students who are working for Google, Facebook and Bloomberg. They're paid with super competitive compensations and they're also paying high number of incoming tax. Are they really cheap labors? I don't think so.
