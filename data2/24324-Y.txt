This proposal definitely should be supported. Im an employee in a big financial company. When I interview candidates, I have responsibility for my company. To decide a candidate qualified or not, it depends on his or her ability and potential. 
Right now because of the high demanding of talents in STEM fields, we invest lots of time and resource to find qualified persons and train them. If an employee has to leave his position after one year, this is such a huge loss for a company. Imagine we have more than 160 employees in f1 status this year and half of them use OPT extension. If this rule cant be passed, I think it will finally damage American economy and America will lose its power of competition in the world.
So, please dont hesitate to pass this proposal, which will help USA attract more talents and eventually benefit our country.
