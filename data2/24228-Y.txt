This is a wonderful idea. First of all, it is easy enough for american citizens to get a job in US. In the career fair, about 70 percent of companies claimed they are not hiring foreign people or they will not support H1B visa for foreigner. Uncle Sam has shown its care to US citizens. However, he could not spoil Americans. Secondly, without OPT extension, US would lose huge amount of talents. That would be a big loss to USA. At last, foreign students, who got H1B and then green card, would finally became a US citizen. They would devote themselves to improving US.
