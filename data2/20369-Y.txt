I support OPT-extension.
Innovation is always the core drive of American economy. And the foundation of innovation is to bring in more valuable immigrants in the field of science and engineering and keep them staying in the U.S. Some people are complaining about immigrants are competing with citizens in job market, making citizens hard to find a job. However, this is biased. The reason why some citizens are hard to find a job is not because immigrants are competing with them. The real cause is that big companies are outsourcing most of their lower level job outside of the U.S. Most of these jobs are blue collar jobs. While with innovation, it actually creates more job opportunities for the country, and this type of jobs are more secure and paid much higher. As we know, U.S. is in short of source of talents in science and engineering as more and more citizens are not willing to study science and engineering in school. 
If you want to find a more secure and higher pay job, why don't prepare and develop yourself in these fields instead of blaming immigrants for taking over jobs from your hands. These people are the reason why the U.S. is still one of the developed country in this U.S. If you think shutting doors on valuable immigrants and kick them all out would be good for you, I bet your life would be way worse 20 years later than now.
