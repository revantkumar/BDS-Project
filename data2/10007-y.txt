Xiaoyu Liang I strongly support this proposed rule. 

U.S. has been one of the most powerful country in the world. One of the major factors is that it attracts all talent from all over the world. With this OPT extension rule, more and more students will be willing to come to the states and study here. This does not only benefit the long term development of the country, but also benefit the current economy. 

Personally, as a foreign Ph.D. student in the states, this extension will give me more opportunities to practice what I have learned. Give me more time to feel the culture in the states. Currently, most Chinese students found that more and more great opportunities have been offered by Chinese government, but it is nice to have a longer experience of working abroad.
