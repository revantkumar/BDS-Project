This is the best proposed rule that will for sure help many International students to gain practical knowledge and extend their stay in U.S..A. It will help not only the individual skills improve also help US govt economy as we contribute big time to US economy.No wonder one would say no to this proposal and infact accept this new rule change gleefully.Hope this rules passes and helps thousands of people leaving the country just because we could not get H-1 B in the no.of chances we have to face with 1:4 ratio.Thanks DHS for your sincere efforts and hopefully it will be implemented.
