There are so many people talking about tax, illegal, terrorist and job opportunities. OPT students are all those who competed with the top students all over the world and are highly qualified smart people. They work hard, pay taxes, obey the law and make tremendous contribution to the U.S. in the past years. If you have ever been to those technology companies in bay area, you will know how many engineers are working there to develop the industry nowadays. Without those talents from all over the world, Apple, Google ,Facebook and so many other industry leaders will be far from developed as these days. This rule has nothing to do with those bad eggs from other countries, it is about all those genius who are making huge differences to the society and creating so many job opportunities for this country. This rule will not only help the industry, but also education. U.S. will be more attractive to international students and universities do need those tuition to keep providing the best education. I just cannot see any downside of this proposal and it should definitely be passed to make the America better.
