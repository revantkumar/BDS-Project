Jeff Huang This extension is very important to me and my university. I am working on a long-term research project. The project just started and probably needs more than 2 years to get everything works well. This project is focused on biomedical issues and is a important one for my university. We are getting some good results and I am the person who is taking care of the project now, but my visa expires soon. If the extension is not approved, I'd have no choice but go back to my country. It is really bad for me if I am forced to stop doing the research I love. Also, it takes very long time to train another one person or two people to get familiar with the project and lead it. It is also a loss to the university. So, I really hope the new extension rule can be approved. In that case, I can continue to contribute to the project and get things work on time. I also know some colleagues who face the same issue of visa expiration. They are excellent scientists and contribute a lot to various medical and drug research areas. Without a longer extension, they cannot stay in US and their works should be forced to stop. It would be a disaster for them and their institutes. Thus, I really would like to see the new extension rule getting approved.
