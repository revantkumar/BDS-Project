I strongly support the proposal which extends the OPT for F1 STEM students to 24 months! 

As a student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I had internship in Mentor Graphics company for two years. I also have friends working as intern or full time employees in Google, Facebook etc. It is quite ridiculous for some negative comments saying that international students will harm the US citizens' employment. As far as I know, it is a common sense that every employer wants to get the BEST students to meet their company's demand! We all went through same selection of resume and interviews. If the employers hire international students instead of the US citizen, then it MUST because the international students are much better qualified for the positions! Otherwise the employer will not spend time and money on helping the international student get the H1B status!
