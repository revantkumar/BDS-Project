I am in support of the stem extension for F1-Nonimmigrant students because the knowledge and expertise gained by the students should be used to serve the nation. As STEM degrees directly affect the nation's economy and growth, extending the stay would really boost the economy of US.Also it is a great opportunity for the students to gain exposure to the world's best industries headquartered in US.

I really hope to see the extension coming into effect as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time.
