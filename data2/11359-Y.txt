It is a benefit for not only F-1 students but also the United States to improve and expand training opportunities. More STEM background F-1 students in job market can keep the US companies competitive worldwide, especially in terms of science and technology. Furthermore, stronger US companies can make fast economy development possible, which will definitely benefit most of American people. Thus, I support impoving and expanding training opportunities fir F-1 students.
