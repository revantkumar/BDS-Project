PREM KISHORE PASULA The Honorable Jeh Johnson

Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a [[graduate student / international student / describe yourself here!]] at the Silicon Valley University (SVU). 99% of SVU graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. [[I and/or many of my colleagues]] will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
[[I am planning to use OPT after graduation...]] or 
[[I am glad my international colleagues are able to gain practical training experience in the US because...]] or
[[Say something about your personal position or experience here!]]
OPT and OPT extension is important to be because [Insert personal reason here].

I am very concerned with the possibility that [[my STEM OPT Extension]] or [[the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension]] might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule-making process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

Thanks & Best regards,
