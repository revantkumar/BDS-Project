It is wrong to expand the OPT program. This administration should be concerned about providing jobs for Americans, not foreigners. Why, when unemployment is one of the major problems in our country, would American workers be shoved aside so that foreign workers can take their jobs? It would seem the administration's allegiance is misplaced. We, the people, are fed up with policies that benefit only immigrants and politicians.
