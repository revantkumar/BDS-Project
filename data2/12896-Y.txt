Don't let them go back to China to work for those communists. I know a lot of Chinese people, although they say they "love" their home country, they will not hesitate to work in US if we provide them a chance. Back in 1960s, a lot of Chinese come back to communist China and made nuclear weapons for those communists! Simply providing them a chance to work in US is much better than sending them back letting them make weapons against us!
