I would absolutely SUPPORT the extension of OPT to 36 months for STEM students, especially for Ph.D. students. The U.S. government, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy... spend so much money and resource to provide them good education. It would be HUGE LOSS for America to force them to return to their home countries after graduation.
