This is a very important and timely step for foreign students studying in the United States . During the past few years , the number of Doctorate and Master's students leaving the United States for other countries have profoundly increased . These are the very folks who discover new drugs or start up new companies . I would be waiting for the day when every Master's and Doctorate have their Green Cards stapled to their degrees . 

I support and commend President Obama and DHS for this important administrative fix . Waiting to see a few more steps to provide relief to legal immigrants working in the United States.
