Inasmuch as the U.S. labor market is so tight and intense, with millions of U.S. taxpayers and citizens out of a job, and LOOKING for one, it makes NO sense whatsoever to open ourselves to foreign labor OVER them! The SOLE reason employers are seeking foreign labor is that they can pay them LESS than comparable U.S. citizens for comparable work! Compounding this labor problem is the overweening glut of illegal border-crossers flooding our labor markets with cheap labor as well, decimating the lower end of employment possibilities for our youth, who will soon be seeking these and higher skill slots as they leave schools and mature.

ALL foreign-hire programs should be terminated, or at the least, greatly slashed, until our own labor problems are resolved!
