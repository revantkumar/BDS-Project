Christian Gates Good one! Many of my friends are not able to hire enough qualified engineers. We definitely need to import more good STEM students around the world, else we will lose the competition with other competitors. This does not have bad effects on the job market because we are too lack of good engineers. Anyone can do well, we would like to hire, both Americans and foreigners. Thanks DHS.
