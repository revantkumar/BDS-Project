I am fully support the expanding Training Opportunities for international student with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all F-1 Students.

As we all know, the opt extension is for the international student who studying in stem. the job they are looking for unable find enough native american student to fulfill. the new opt extension help american companies fully operate and create value more easily. 

the Cap-Gap is a really smart propose. once the company are willing to sponsor F-1 student that's mean the student are great at the job and they can not find american to fulfill the occupation. there is no sense to force them stop working when their opt end and H1b application is still in progress. 

all in all. I don't see any bad thing about the propose. on the one hand, as long as companies and students follow the regulation, I don't see student will take the job that would belong to american. after all company will always choose the American over the F-1 student if they have similar background. On the other hand,the benefit will attract more student to go to the job market which has lack of supply,and ultimately benefit the country because of the increase of tax income.
