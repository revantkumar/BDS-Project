I strongly support OPT-extension. It's a win-win strategy for both US and international students. It benefits USA's economy and its development. 

And regarding to the American citizens who can not find a job, the reason is not international students, it's because themselves.They should improve themselves in order to get a job. International students got their jobs not because they are cheap labors but because of their talent!
