Felix Liu I support this amazing rule. 
I'm a graduate student majoring in Computer Science in New York, as an American Asian boy, I'm eager to know more about my original homeland China. But I lack the exposure chances to the very core of the Chinese culture. However, I've made some Chinese friends who are native in China, and international students here. I really want them to stay in USA longer before they return. We are always proud of our diversity. And I don't think they will grab native's job openings, since they focus on the STEM fields. And they can only by hired by E-Verified companies which have equity to all kinds of candidates. And they will for sure contribute to our economy boost.
