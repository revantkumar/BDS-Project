I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. In my opinion, Providing STEM students the industry training opportunity during school and after graduation can benefit U.S. in two ways: 

First, an ample period of OPT is an important strength to attract the international students. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe U.S. could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country. And more and more students probably would choose to study in other countries along with a better policy to international students. So the new OPT extension rule could better ensure the U.S. academic sectors remain competitive globally. 

On the other hand, if the rule is terminated by some reasons, it is definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Qualcomm, Amazon, Facebook, etc. International STEM talents from all over the world make their contributions to these companies and U.S. after graduation every year. Without a sensible OPT extension rule, U.S. will suffer the problem of brain drain and lose the leading position in cutting-edge science and high-tech fields.
