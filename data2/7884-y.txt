Peng Zhang I personally strongly SUPPORT this regulation. International students who got educated from U.S education system and they become skillful and knowledgable person. They are ready to make contributions to the society. It is very WISE to allow them to stay in U.S. to help develop and improve our society rather than force them to leave.
