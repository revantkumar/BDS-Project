Thomas Rose I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension! Some people keep saying international students take Americans' job. Come on! Those international students are studying what Americans don't want to study:Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry. Do you Americans really like to study such subjects? NO! How many American graduate students are in the chemistry, biology or STEM departments? A few! Americans like law school and medical school which help them to find well-paid jobs. So how can you say international students take your jobs? These are jobs you don't even wantThat is nonsense to keep saying international students take Americans' jobs. It is also ridiculous to use this nonsense to reject the opt-extension for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees.
