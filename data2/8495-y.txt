Joyce Weisel It is clear that my government cares more about Foreign workers making money than American citizens. We need a government that has American's interests first and foremost. Whether it's low skilled or skilled, Americans first. Our Black American Youth are being disenfranchised the most and this must stop. Sounds like we need some sort of law that before any foreigner or illegal can be employed our employment numbers have to be below a certain number, like maybe 2%. We also have to have workfare instead of welfare. We have to make our country great again.
