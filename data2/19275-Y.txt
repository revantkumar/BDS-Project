I saw some comments mentioned about employers spent less to pay for the international student then pay for the U.S. citizen. I don't agree with that. In the new rule, it's obviously that employer need to spend more on international students because of providing the training to them. In this case, the U.S. citizen actually got more opportunities especially for those startups. On the other hand, if international students all lose their job at Feb 2016, do we have enough U.S citizen who can continue their work? That's a big crash! 
We don't have enough Americans work on the STEM area that's why we need international students. It's not because of hiring international students and Americans lose their jobs. 
Overall, I strongly agree with the OPT extension for F1 STEM Degrees.
