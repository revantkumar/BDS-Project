Jerry Chen I strongly support the regulation. Without extension for STEM student, some of them might be forced to leave the company they work in. That is a bad thing both for student and company. Company invests a year to train the student, but student cannot work for the company after that. For the student, she/he loses the chance to continue gain experience in US. Not mention how importance STEM students are for IT industry in US.
