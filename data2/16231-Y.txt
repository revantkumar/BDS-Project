I think a 24-month extension to STEM OPT is actually very necessary. 

From the student side, we want to have a relatively stable period of time in USA, not worrying about where to go after a short OPT time. With a small period of time, it's hard for us to show our value nor to accomplish something.

From the companies side, they don't want to lose their employees after spending lots of time growing them.
