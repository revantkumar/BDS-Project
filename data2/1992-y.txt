Amna Mirza I strongly support extending STEM OPT to 24 months, because this is the best way to retain STEM talent in the United States. 
A slower economy means job searches are taking longer, and students need some leeway in terms of interview time after graduating.
Additionally, OPT serves as a buffer against losing the H-1 visa lottery.
