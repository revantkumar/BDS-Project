Siddharth Gupta Unites States is very well known for the cutting edge technology it provides which is second to none. But there is an underlying fact which many people are not aware of, majority of the talented individuals who have sown the seeds for the growth of the economy are/have been immigrants in the past. The education system in USA is very robust, it enables one to work hands on in their field and gives them an opportunity to learn and grow professionally. One of the major sectors which benefits from this is the science and technology sector. Unfortunately, there is not enough work force to meet the demands of this sector. But with this rule being passed, it would enable the economy to grow to it's true potential. As this will not only meet the demand for talented people to work in STEM related fields, this will also give rise to new business and ventures. Students who have a STEM Degree have very sound logical and mathematical skills, this skills are what is required to cement USAs position in the global economy. 

I understand that many people would not endorse this bill, but a person who is genuine, who has worked very hard to achieve his goals, deserves a chance to grow. There are loot of malpractices involved in the immigration process, for example: many people apply through consulting firms which are fake and are out to destroy the faith in students who are genuine. I would strongly request you to take necessary action against such companies/people.

Nonetheless, the OPT STEM extension has many positives than negatives for the US economy as whole. And I would strongly endorse this bill.
