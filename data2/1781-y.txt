Yin Liu I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I'm an international chemical engineering master student from China and is a scientist in a pharmaceutical company now. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree, such as US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity and give STEM enough time of CPT and OPT during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. 

What's more, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my current work experience at pharma industry, almost every research/project development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion, which is not good for both the STEM students and the US companies.

As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living in China, I would return back to my own country eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.

Hope this proposal can be approved!
