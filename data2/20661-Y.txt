I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

Firstly, the world has changed a lot! With the background of economic globalization, a successful company needs to gather the wisdom from all around the world. OPT could help companies in the US employ students in different cultures, which could give them different type of thinking. But if those students only have one-year OPT, most of them will only have time to adapt to the new working environment, but not have time to help the company develop new ideas. So the new OPT extension rule is needed for US companies to think bigger.

Secondly, if there is no OPT extension, many many foreign students will choose other countries such as German or Australia, which has better policy for them to develop. OPT extension could help US universities gain more attention from students in other countries, which could help US universities collect more money in the future. In this way, US universities will become better and better, and keep becoming top universities.

Lastly, I am eager to go back to China after the OPT. Because China is developing very fast and I want to live and work there for the rest of my life. But only one year's working experience is of little help for me to get a very good job in China. So with this new OPT extension, I could gain more working experience and get a better job in China, which could help me a lot.
