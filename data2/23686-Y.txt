I strongly SUPPORT this proposal to extend STEM OPT program.

STEM OPT program will only help U.S. to keep ahead of global competition, not limited to only academics, but also economically and culturally. A caring program for international students is necessary for the U.S. to attract the most brilliant, diligent talents from all around the world. These international students are able to bring great values, higher the standards, and create new opportunities in their fields. Social diversity has always been in this countrys DNA, this talented group is an essential population to keep the society stay healthy and balanced.

Besides the general benefits to the U.S., the extension would give STEM students a wonderful opportunity to finally apply their skills and knowledge they learned on campuses on real job markets. With majority of todays STEM research projects last more than 2 years, an OPT extension is necessary to allow them finish up the project and make valuable contribution to their fields. If they only have 1 year for OPT, most of them will have to go back to their home country without completing the current project, it will be a huge loss for the student. The companies will also suffer from the loss of talents, resources and investment from training.
