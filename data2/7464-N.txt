We have so many American's in our country who are unable to find employment or a job that will pay the bills and provide enough to prevent them from seeking welfare support, therefore, I do not feel that we should be bringing foreigner's in to our country to take our jobs or work for less on order to bring our wages down. America is struggling enough. We need to improve our own quality of life before allowing foreigners to come in and make it worse. Our tax dollars don't need to go to bringing more foreigners into our country either.
