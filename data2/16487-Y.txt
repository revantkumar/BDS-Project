I support this proposal,

without those STEM students, My company will collapse!

Competition exists everywhere in this world, If you expect to reduce competition by expelling those diligent STEM students, I can firmly guarantee you that US cannot keep hold its present leading position in this world. 

Please seriously consider about this. We need those students.
