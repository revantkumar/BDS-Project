Yi Shi I strongly support this extension rule.

However, I think there should be strong provisions to protect US workers to shut down oppositions from the other side.
I agree with your comments that there should be stronger and clearer provisions to protect US workers.

There are a lot meaningful provisions in the current OPT stem rule that could be implemented to protect US
workers and will be welcomed by international students:
1) Set up a black list of companies which abuse the OPT program. Those companies in the black list
will be barred from using the program forever
2) Define a high enough and clear enough prevailing wage requirement for students on OPT
3) Limit the opt program to students graduated from top 50-100 US universities. This will resolve
your concern that foreign students will flood the labor market and hurt US workers by reducing
the pool of students on OPT

I also think the mentoring program is very impractical and should be removed. Company does not have experience in mentoring and it will be viewed as a discrimination against US domestic students.
