u.s. is a high debt country in worldwide paying debt back relays on high tech industry profit. however, in recent years, u.s. can't deny the fact that it is bit lack of high tech elites. domestic stem(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) labor doesn't supply enough. thus, u.s. need foreigner stem labor to support domestic productivity. 
furthermore, raising opt extension labor won't affect the labor force that much due to the unchanged h1b and green card quote, unless domestic worker completely dominated by foreigner work in every respect during long term run, which is merely possible.
besides, new opt extension has more rigorous stipulation than previous one on duration, compensation, major pertinence and so on. such could force foreign labor to contribute to stem industries and to domestic consumption gdp when they stay in u.s. soil.
