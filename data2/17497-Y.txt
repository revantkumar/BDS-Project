I strong support this rule on improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.

Looking back the history, one of the most important reasons that the United State of America becomes the strongest country in the world is because she keeps attracting excellent and talented people all over the world to come to and make significant contribution to this country. This started when the country was established and reached the peak after WWII. As a result, the open and diversity become the fundamental spirits of this country. If America wants to remain the strongest country and leading position in the world, she need to continue attracting excellent and talented people all over the world. Among those new graduated young people, some of them will be another Albert Einstein or Steve Jobs in the future. It would be very regretful if such Albert Einstein or Steve Jobs in the future have to leave the country just because they do not win the H1-B lottery year after year.

The main opposite argument is that foreign students and immigrants occupy the limited job opportunity from the citizens. In my opinion, these young foreign students should not take the responsibility for and become the victims of the limited and decreased job positions. It is the government that needs to take the responsibility for creating more and more job opportunities. Attracting excellent and talented people all over the world to work for America may generate new growth points in both technology and economy, and hence, increase the job opportunities in the future. On the other hand, refusing the contribution from foreign students and immigrants will definitely make the job opportunities less and less year after year.
