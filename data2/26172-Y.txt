Being four years as an electrical engineering student, I know giving more opportunity to skilled Nonimmigrant students will not jeopardize American workers. For years, foreign STEM degree students have made huge contributions to the country's engineer and scientific research that cannot be ignored. Yet, the limited time of training opportunities have prevented huge number of skilled F-1 nonimmigrant students from doing this. There are many work opportunity available for both native Americas and immigrants. With a 24 month OPT extension, these foreign students can do more benefits to United States.
