Dear officers and everyone, 

I am writing to support the OPT extension to 24 months. I am an International student, who studied in the States for 6 years and now working at a IT company. In my mind, US is the place for people to have dreams come true. As long as people work hard, we can achieve their dream regardless of the race, background. This motivates a lot of international people to the states. We bring the culture diversity and creative thoughts to the States. We are contributing to various areas. However, sad things happen due to VISA status. Many americans are against the proposal of providing jobs to international people. The thought is so dangerous. Competition among people help improve the overall society productivity. Kicking all talent international worker out of the states is a terrible idea. This will prevent people from coming to this country in future. Instead, people should be provided with better opportunities.
