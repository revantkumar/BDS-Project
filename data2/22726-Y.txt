I strongly support this opt extension proposal, I am an intern who is a stem degree holder,at a start-up medical instruments company and am responsible for both the optics and electronics projects, our company's target is to put our second and third state-of-art machines into market at the middle of 2018. Obviously, I can not quit in the middle of the projects, it would bring huge troubles. People like me are around the whole States in all kinds of companies, if we leave I can not see anything good coming.

Everyone, who wants to find a job in America, including the citizen, has equal opportunities to find a job in an E-verified system, companies have the right to hire a more competitive employee who might be everyone, to make progress. 

So, not only for the "stemers" benefits, but also for the benefits of tons of American companies, or even the prosperity of economy of the USA, this proposal is a great idea which needs to be executed.
