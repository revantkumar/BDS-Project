The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers. Put the American worker first, instead of all those who are leaving comments begging for this government to put them first instead of the real citizens so that corporations can force lower wages on the American working class. 

Our nation's government should be protecting us against corporations' greed and the selfishness shown by international individuals coming here from other nations. Nations who do not appear to take care of their own otherwise why would these people not want to go home and use their skill sets to improve their own nations. This is going to stop soon thanks to a great man but it should not be up to him, our representatives should be listening to us and take action on our wishes. Deport them all than put the real American citizens back to work instead of putting us on welfare and the unemployment line. This is one of the reason we hate most of the American government and why we hate internationals being in our nation. Stop it and stop it all now !!!
