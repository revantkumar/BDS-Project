I strongly support Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees. From the policy makers' point of view, the pros easily outweighs the cons for an expansion of the OPT to 24 months. First of all, it provides equal opportunity to everyone, which is a symbol of the US and a reason why all these international talents are coming to the US for higher degree STEM education. Secondly, to keep our position as the biggest super power of the world, extending the time in which leading international STEM talents will be contributing to our nation is extremely important. Otherwise, we are just sending the fruits of our higher education for international students away after utilizing our resources to educate these international talents. Therefore, as this is an extension of contribution to our nation and not a way to keep international students permanently in the US, it is totally reasonable and should be fully supported.
