By allowing government officials, not elected by the people, to extend rules, make rules, or fail to enforce those designed to protect American citizens, we allow tyranny to flourish in the United States. We need to immediately express distain for those agencies that fail to enforce the law. This agency and many others are violating their oaths and failing to live up to the standards we once had for all federal civil servants. Our children need jobs and this lawlessness by an overreaching government needs to stop immediately.
