I am a landlord of near USC campus. Most of my income are from international students. Because of the unstability of OPT policy, the students are not likely to sign long-term lease. I think bring good international students to US is good for US economy, why we don't provide the path for them to be employed if they are capable of doing the jobs. I strongly support the 24-month extension of OPT policy
