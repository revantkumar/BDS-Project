It is definitely going to be beneficial to both of the F1 students and the U.S it self. Some one may claim that the extension of OPT will take away thousands of jobs from Americans, however i don't agree with that. The new OPT will allow the employers have more time to observe students and be more clear about if the student is qualified. With that mean it will be more strict and selective. At the same time, of course it benefits to the students as well because it gives them more time to get used to the working environment in the U.S for those of them who want to stay; at the same time, the extension of OPT will allow student have more time to think about their future for career that either stay in the U.S or not.
In general, it is why i would write this comment and show my support to this proposal. 
Thank you!
