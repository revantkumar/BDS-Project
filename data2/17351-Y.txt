It is shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens:

1. It's a national ethos of the United States to give everyone who can do it an equal opportunity. 

2. It's beneficial to the U.S. economy because skilled and educated STEM workers mostly contribute to the science and technology industry. Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world.

3. It's good for U.S. education industry since longer OPT will attract more foreign students coming to study in the U.S.

4. Competition does exist, but it's not a bad thing. It helps U.S. companies to hire the right person, lifting the average working force quality and boosting the economy. 

5. One reason for the extension to be 24 months is that a lot projects are 2 to 3 years long. It would be very much a trouble for companies to switch among different workers for the projects.

In summary, I think OPT extension is not a threat to the U.S. and U.S. citizens, but rather a benefit for exactly the US universities, companies, economy (and therefore for each individual.) Particularly, this very ruling is exactly out there to address people's concerns about abusing the OPT program and to make sure the OPT program will not become a drain for US jobs.
