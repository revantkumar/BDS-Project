I strongly agree the new rules of extending OPT period. 
First, this would make international students focus on study when at school without worrying too much about job search in last semesters before graduation. They could take their time and absorb more form school.
Second, an extension of OPT can increase the probability of STEM students to be hired in the States. Few employers want to hire a person who are only allowed to work in USA for only 1 or 2 years even they know that candidate is very excellent in every aspects.
Third, more STEM students working in the US could be a strong push to the economy and I believe those talents could bring a lot of revenue and cultural diversity.
