Support this rule. And it would be better if the OPT extension period is longer than 24 months. It's already harder and harder nowadays for international students to find jobs in the US. More companies especially small-sized ones prefer to hire green card holder and permanent residents. OPT period is the students' only chance. It's great lose to let them go back to their countries once they graduate from US colleges.
