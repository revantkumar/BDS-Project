Zhouyang Li I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. Having talented and well-educated foreign people working in the field of STEM can aid American economic growth.
2. The expanded training opportunities can attract more intelligent foreign students to study in the U.S.. And these students are able to contribute to the research and development of the U.S..
3. Foreign students should enjoy the same opportunities as native students. They deserve more time to put what they learn in the U.S. into practice, and thus reinforce and expand their knowledge in these fields.
