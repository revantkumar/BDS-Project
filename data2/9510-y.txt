Steve Jones This proposed rule will be detrimental to US economy because:

1) Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. This will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.
2) OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.
3) OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.
4) OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.

Please do not pass this detrimental rule.

Sincerely,
Steve Jones
