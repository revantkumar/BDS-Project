OPT extension is a good approach to help STEM students work in US. It is absolutely a good benefit to F1 students. But more importantly, this adds a lot of new grads to the US companies. The students can greatly contribute to the economic development of the country. After the extension, good students can stay in US to contribute more. The US companies do not need to worry about the h1b visa for new grads and can hire more candidates easily. Longer extension benefits US more. I am looking forward to witnessing the proposal to be approved!
