I am in total opposition of extending this ruling. It simply cheats American graduates of finding a suitable job in their field because companies WILL pay foreign workers less money, will NOT have to provide them with benefits; WILL NOT have to pay any payroll taxes, thus saving said companies MORE money. By not having to,pay any payroll taxes, less money will go into social security and Medicare. And by cheating American workers out of decent living wage jobs, more will be added to welfare lists, still less money will be added to SS and Medicare, more people will become dependent on the government for support and finally creating America as the next welfare state. Please do not let this happen!
