I am a PhD student from Biochemistry major from a state University. I am totally support the OPT extensions for the following reasons.

1) STEM graduate students are major candidate pool for science and tech industry. From what I know, there are much fewer American students on STEM majors than international students, in my department the ratio is like 3 to 1. I've been to biopharma industry for one year, and a lot of hiring managers are complaining that they cannot find qualified candidates for their job opening of chemistry and biology major. So the job market definitely needs more STEM candidates to back up their future business. If the extension cancelled, a lot of well-educate students go back to their home country or just go to Canada, it will be a great lost for US company in the near future.

2) Those current employees who use to be on OPT and extension are major contributors in their company. This is the most obvious example to show that OPT extension is a striking effective way to save the young intelligence of science major and transfer their power from university to industry. They are making profit for the whole society, not themselves. They pay taxes, they don't steal anything.

3) US is an attractive place for work because of its Freedom. H1B lottery and cut of OPT extension certainly go against the Freedom spirit for young generations. If STEM students lost their interests in the freedom atmosphere in US, they are still smart and will just find another country to contribute for GDPs. They just lost a job, they will find another one somewhere else. US will lost their backup for future students.
