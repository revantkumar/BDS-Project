History has proved that isolationism is not good for a country's economics. Foreign STEM students can bring diversities into the technology industry and inspire creativities among talent workers. This is healthy for the blooming of the industry. When these students go back to their own countries after the OPT, they can better understand the business culture in US and can help doing business with US companies in their countries. Plus, It usually takes 2 to 3 years to train a master's student and 5 or more years to train a PhD student. If these students do not get a opportunity to work in the US, it seem that US is becoming a training center for high-tech employees of other countries.
