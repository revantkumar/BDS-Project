Rushikesh Trivedi I strongly SUPPORT this rule. The F-1 students in STEM Degrees are young and smart people. Those students are always on top level in their own country and are most creative in their field. They are constantly making significant contribution for boosting the economy of USA. Moreover, USA is the country welcoming top talent from the entire world. I SUPPORT this rule.
