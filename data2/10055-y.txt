JING JIN I totally support this proposal.
As we can see, the economy will suffer imponderable loss once millions of students leave America. 
Firstly, companies need engineers(large numbers of them are foreigners) and it is impossible to fill these vacancies immediately. And we can't image what will happen if the enormous companies lost order even only one day.
Secondly, the main reason why America has the most international students is the opportunity. Students want to find better study and work opportunities, so they give up a relative comfortable life environment. If they don't have the work opportunity, America will not be a good study choice for international students. Especially for the STEM students, they not only bring the large consumption, but also technology creativity. Advance idea and results need these students proposal and practice.
