Our country was founded by immigrants, and is made a more wonderful place every day by hard working immigrants. Those people who think we should toss them all out are stupid. Please don't toss out our future! The vegetable harvesters and rocket scientists of the future are probably going to be immigrants. People like Ann Coulter who claim to not be descended from immigrants, but from settlers, are not bright enough or hard working enough for either of those careers!
