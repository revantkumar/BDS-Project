Hello, 
I think increasing the STEM extension to 24 months is a great thing and I'm excited about that. I can gain more experience and contribute towards the American economy by working here longer before I head home. 12 months is too short of a time to gain good experience and for my employer to get a return on their investment. They have to invest a lot in training a new hire. If the STEM extension is not there, this will discourage the employers from hiring highly talented, skilled workers, thereby hurting the American economy more. More skilled workers in America translates to more advanced technology here and that helps the economy. It would like beneficial to America to retain skilled workers here, rather than let them go abroad and become competition to America. We all love America, I personally do and I am proud of living in a country with the most advanced technology in the world.
