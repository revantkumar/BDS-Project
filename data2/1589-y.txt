Sirs: Please don't let me hear you say "I can't figure out why the American Public is so upset with the government" when you have such a disastrous program such as this. We have millions of Americans out of work and you dufusses are wanting more money to pay Aliens to come in and let the taxpayer pay for their education so they can supplant American workers. This really Pis_es me off. Why don't you just print a couple of Trillion dollars and hand it out to any and all aliens, who wont look back. 

Did it ever occur to you that American workers pay your salry and if you give all the money away on programs like this you are not liable to get a raise. Oh yeah, I forgot there for a minute, you make sure you get your money first. Oh yeah, I'm upset alright.

Sincerely,
Jerome Menard
