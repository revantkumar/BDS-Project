I run my own company and I know how difficult it is to find the qualified person and how long it need to train him/her. It is hard to find any American in my field, which is about math and electronics. To be honest, I don't want to hire some one who can only work less than 1 year and then leave due to the new OPT policy. It takes me a lot of time and money to train a new employee until he or she can handle the job independently. And no offence, I don't like hiring American people since most of them want more salary but don't do more job.
