jack lee I strongly SUPPORT the proposal:

1. The government should allow the students who learned STEM from U.S. universities have more time to stay in the country and contribute to our country, because we do not have enough people in the STEM area. The most important fact is that this couldn't hurt our US job market and American's job opportunities because we lack science people.

2. It helps improve the diversity in US and this is the fundamental part in our country.

3. Maybe it makes more competition, but I don't think it matters. The competition can keep us work a little harder and it is not bad.
