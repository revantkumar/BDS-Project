International students are not the ones that stealing American jobs, those cheap, uneducated workers shipped in by big consulting companies are the ones to blame, they were brought in on H1B and replaced hundreds of thousands of American IT jobs including Southern California Edison, Walt Disney etc. H1B / L1 visas are beinb abused! International students can hardly even get H1B because most of the quota are taken by consulting companies by submitting multiple applications for one candidate. 

By retiring OPT will only make things worse because all the H1B visas will be taken by imported cheap labors, so please, stop criticizing OPT, focus on H1B abuse!
