The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.

I am opposed to this program in its entirety. As a retired engineering professor I witnessed how our graduate programs are being overrun by foreign faculty and students. 

We should find ways to encourage US Citizens to remain in school past their baccalaureate degrees and pursue advanced degrees making them elgible to obtain university positions. 

We need to provide incentives to industry to invest and sponsor US Citizens in their pursuit of STEM degrees to build up the manpower needed in our country.
