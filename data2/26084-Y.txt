I STRONG support the new opt-extension law. 

Firstly, foreign students in OPT PAY TAX. Most international students work in engineering and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. Each year, an OPT worker pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people.

Secondly, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

Therefore, I highly support this new policy and really hope this could be APPROVED!!!!
