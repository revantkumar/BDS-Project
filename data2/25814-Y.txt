I believe with OPT extension, it could provide a more stable situation for the US's economic, because there is more and more companies needing people with STEM background, however the US citizens are not enough for that. With OPT extension, it provides international students longer time to stay in those companies, maintaining a stable condition for that. And it could contribute more to the whole society's economic development.
