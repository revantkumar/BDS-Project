I think the OPT should be extended. I have three reasons to state. 
First of all, why do students come to America instead of other countries? OPT is one of the reasons. If OPT extension is canceled, America will lose competetiveness attracting students.
Second, a lot of people are already in extension. They will be in trouble if they need to leave at once. 
Last but not least, international students activate economy to develop. For example, school, restaurants, supermarkets and renters make a lot of money from students. If the students amount decreases greatly, I do not believe American will not complain about the loss.
