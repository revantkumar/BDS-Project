Obama wants to kill America with every avenue available. There is a little-known program called "Optional Practical Training" (OPT). OPT allows foreign students who hold an F-1 student visa to work for up to 12 months in a job that's related to their field of study. But the Obama Administration wants to expand it to 36 months for foreign students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
I am opposed to anything that doesn't support our American citizens first and foremost over any foreign person, illegal person, or invader person trying to force their way into America and take advantage of our tax payers. Every penny spent should be properly spent to take care of America first. I am angry that our elected officials abuse their authority in the way they use our economy for their own benefit or in an attempt for gaining votes. Our own American students deserve to be in a position to have these programs such as OPT instead of offering them to foreign students. The American job market has been suffering for years. These jobs that are related to the students field of study should only be available for American citizens...period!
