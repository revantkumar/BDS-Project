Daniel Jing I strongly support this rule for F-1 students since we deserve it and it is a win-win situation for both F-1 students and Americans. 
Former F-1 students who now are working at US have made a lot of contribution to the current prosperity and success of Unite States. It is has been proved as a successful policy. And I think we deserve an equal change to stay and fulfill our American dream. We should not been blamed for the unemployment of some natives. First of all, we are minorities, we only take a few of job positions compare to the whole job market. Secondly, proper competition is good for the employers to select the best person and will let natives improve themselves to get a better job. What's more, it's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work here, which will produce more job opportunities in the future. If F-1 students have to go back to their country due to the failure of this rule, I think it is the starting points that United States lose core competitiveness.
