I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

I'm an international CS master student from China. Before I came to the US, I had many options to purse my master degree: US, Canada, Singapore, British, Japan. The most important reason I choose to study in the US is because here provides me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. 

So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. .
