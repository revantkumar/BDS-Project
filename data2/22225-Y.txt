Immigrants have been and will always be one of the most important part of the American dream. OPT is the best way to provide practical training for promising international students. Actually most contribution in tech companies have been made by international scientists/engineers. They are a vital component of the American society that not only pays a lot of taxes but also keeps US stay in top at education, research, tech and engineering areas. And therefore US will surely benefit from OPT extension for STEM students. This is a real solid step to 'make America great again' rather than selecting a man with no respects to immigrants, women and the constitution, who also has no experience in governing, to be the president.
