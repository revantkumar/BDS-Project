I highly support this policy. I'm a software engineer working for a start-up in Silicon Valley. We have a lot of qualified, innovative and smart young people. No matter they are US citizens or not, they are diligently doing their work every day. They are developing high quality code, working long hours contributing to Science and Technology. Their value can be seen everyday everywhere. They deserve longer period of stay in this country.
Those negative comments made several common mistakes. Firstly, unemployment of US citizens has nothing to do with OPT students. Job market is such a place that strong ones always win. Talented people use their wisdom win offers. They are not begging for it. Companies are not charity organizations they hire people to create the most value, which will not only do good to the whole country's economy but also benefit people's everyday life. Secondly, those negative comments are short-sighted and blindly follow the trend of anti-immigrants. A lot of those comments are follow the same model, talking about similar story, using the same data again and again. They don't respect their own comment right and are just madly shouting and complain to their government. Last one, is the most import one. They are talking about H1B abuse but they totally misunderstanding the difference between OPT students and the low-price labors from outsourcing companies. If OPT extension is gone, real talented graduates will be forced to leave the country, there'll be more H1B abuse by those outsourcing companies. 
Thanks DHS for all the efforts to make the talented young people stay here.
