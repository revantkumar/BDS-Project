I strongly support this idea because US is getting strong in recent 200 years because of immigrants bringing numerous intellence and treasures. It is even right nowdays. Camparing to being conservative and exclude the new graduate international students from part of US telents reservoir, extending the OPT can let those new telents contribute more to US high tech industries. Usually, a new student can get the job position, only when the company could not recruit enough telents from domestic students, which is obvious that the international students can not occupy the postions that "belong to" domestic students. Instead, if the high tech industies is getting better, it would accelatate the whole US economy and creat more job positions. For above reason, please consider US future properly, and do not let your nearsightednessve lose competitiveness in this world.
