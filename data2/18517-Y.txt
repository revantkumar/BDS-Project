Stem opt extension is important for usa as well because without it international students will not opt to study in usa as they have to spend in American dollars for their education which is quite expensive.For example take the situation in UK,they cancelled work visa for international students and now international students are not opt-in to go to UK to study as they don't have any opportunity to put their knowledge gained to practical use.So I urge the American government to continue the stem opt as in the long term it would effect USA
