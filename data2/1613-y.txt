Peng Ni As an international student here in the US, I have many friends who benefitted from the opt extension for their career development. The 12 months of OPT is often too short for us to obtain valid working VISA. First of all, it's already difficult to find a company that supports H1B for its employers. Secondly, even if a company supports H1B, there's still a high chance recently to lose the H1B lottery because of too many applicants. 

Most of my friends used their 17-month opt extension before they got sponsorship from the companies. As a comparison, most of my friends whose majors are not in STEM categories had to leave US (including my wife) because few companies are willing to support them. Without the policy of extension for STEM categories, I can expect many students leaving US within the first half year after their graduation. 

Really, if you know there's little chance to find a job, why would you waste your time in US? And if the chance of finding a job is low, why would people even come to the US to study? One important reason why education in the US is evaluated higher than in Europe for foreigners is because of the chance to gain working experience after graduation.
