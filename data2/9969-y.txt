Qian Zhang I understand that US citizens have concerns that OPT extension might allow international students seize their job opportunities. However, in some narrow field of scientific research, the job opportunities are quite limited. Due to this reason,
US citizens working on the areas are quite few. However, there is a considerable amounts of international students are doing PhD research in those fields. Research conducted by talented international students under the direction of PIs keeps the leading role of US in those fields.

Planetary Mineralogy is one of such fields. In this field, International students usually work as a postdoc researcher after their PhDs with OPT. One year is far from sufficient for a postdoc. A complete research work would last for at least two years because a large number of experiments using complex facilities such as Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago and Advanced Light Source of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. If OPT is extension for 2 years can be approved, a F1 student would be able to finish his/her postdoc solely with OPT. Otherwise, his/her PI needs to apply for H1B for him/her, that will result in extra cost from US tax-payer.

Therefore, I support the 2-year extension of OPT. That will guarantee the working authorization of a considerable number of international post-docs in a lot of scientific fields. It also guarantees their long term contributions to the leading role of US in different scientific fields.
