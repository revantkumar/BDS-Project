The new policy will have great effect on both US citizens and international students. Now the US doesn't have a strong economic after the financial crisis in 2008.The government is lack of economic momentum for many industries, especially for the high-tech industries such as IT industries. The US needs more and more people work in these areas because they are the future of the US economic. The most opponent think international students take their work opportunities. But the fact is that what most international students's did is the work which US company cannot hire enough US citizens. If there are none international student working in these areas, the US company cannot find enough people to fill these positions, which will decrease the development of the US economic. In fact, the people who occupy the work opportunities are the ICC company, not the international students. As most international students are well-educated and elites of their own countries, with most of them focusing on the high-tech degrees. I believe the extension will bring high-quality IT human resources for the US and facilitate to boost US economy significantly. In a work, I am totally support the new policy.
