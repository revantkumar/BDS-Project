I support the OPT extension for international students. 

I don't see a direct relation between the U.S. unemployment rate and the OPT extenstion for STEM students. First off, majority of the unemployment doesn't come from information or high tech sectors, but rather comes from Construction, Retails, Leisure and hospitality, Education and health services, which have less to do with international students from STEM program. Secondly, extending OPT to 36 months does not equal to immigration. It simply means that they get to work in the States for 3 years after graduation. 

Extending OPT for STEM students can benefit U.S. in the long run. Not only would this new rule attracts more students and their family to study in the U.S and visit the U.S, but also more talents from all over the world. Being protective will make U.S. less competitive in the world.
