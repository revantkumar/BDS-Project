I am totally against this program, and I find it amazing that with the unemployment where it is today and college graduates having a hard time finding work, that our government would try to introduce such a program! It's despicable!! We need to change the misdirected policies in Washington that would even propose efforts such as this, and instead we must insist on protecting the opportunities we have for the citizens of the USA.
