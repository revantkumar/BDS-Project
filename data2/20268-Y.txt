I strongly support this rule because foreign students can bring creativity and diversity to this country. The U.S is such a great country that encourages freedom, diversity, and equality.Foreign students should also enjoy the freedom and equality of this country. OPT extention will actually boost the economy by keeping the talent and intelligence in the country. 
I also think OPT extention should not be restricted to STEM majors, because students from other majors also deserve more opportunities to learn from and contribute to the American companies. 
On the other hand,let's not just think about saving jobs for Americans, but creating more jobs through a prosperous economy.The market doesn't stay the same all the time, and a growing market can benefit everyone, including both the foreign students and the Americans workers.
