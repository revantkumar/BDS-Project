anirudh bhosekar i have come to this country with the hope of excelling in the degree that i have earned through sheer hard work.how do i prove myself and redeem myself if not given a chance to pursue the ambitions that i have had whilst gaining the degree.In this competitive world, A loser is a one who doesn't make big in the chance given to him.but in this scenario i would be a loser if not given a chance in the very first place. As a child growing up, United states of America has always been the land of opportunities and ambitions.it has always had this tradition of welcoming enlightened minds and revered personalities in Science,Technology and various other fields who have given their utmost contribution to the upliftment of humanity.We should not jeopardize all this in the name of this immigration crisis which would be a loss for everybody.I would like whoever be the authority in this matter to safeguard the ideals this country was created on.Freedom,Equality and justice to everybody.Lets Make Unce Sam hold his head high again in the midst of all this.God Bless America.
