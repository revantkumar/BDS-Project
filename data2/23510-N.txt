Well, here we go again! Putting foreigners ahead of our own American citizens!! What are our graduates supposed to do, when they are all finished with their schooling, probably have loans to pay back, and go out looking for a job, and there are none?...they're already taken... for 3 YEARS!!! Big business can save the matching payroll taxes, so they're for it, of course. So why is our government...our President....working against our young people? As far as I'm concerned, we need to stop giving foreign students jobs for even a year....we have American graduates EVERY year looking for jobs. I say, Americans first! We are having some hard times in this country, so we should be loyal to our own, even more! Give the jobs to our citizens....common sense!!!
