Xiang Yao, NYU I strongly support opt extension !
1. Protectionism is bad for American. Getting rid of competition is bad for people itself and for the economy as a whole. 
2. The STEM will do great contribution to the new technology development. 
3. STEM students learn the most advanced technology and should use them to contribute to American society. 
4. If no opt, those students are forced to go back to China and other Russian which are competitor for American.
5. People should not discriminate international student and getting the best people is what makes American special and good for American long term.
