Siddartha Rao Chennur This is an exciting news! I believe this policy not only benefits the international students, but also contributes to the development of technology and education in the U.S. Firstly, there will be adequate time for students to devote for the country where they studied several years. Secondly, this good news will strengthen the relationships between America and other countries. That is, they can share more information, more resources and more opportunities. Thirdly, more and more international students will be interested in studying in the U.S. which is good for the combination of different cultures and also the improvement of the local economy.
