Xiaohua Liu It's unfair for international students as well also a strike on US society too. As international students get admitted and come to USA for further education, most of us pay a lot of money for tuition and living expense, which contributes enormously to the economic chain of education for the united states. If the OPT policy get cancelled or shortened, it will have a negative impact on our choices of places to study. Let's put America at best interest to say, what makes it the best country in the world? The answer is definitely the diversity, freedom and spirit of equality. All man are created equal, same applies for immigrants and international students, why don't give us a equal chance to compete in the market, to see who are the most hard-working men and who contribute more to the country's economy while even though standing with a disadvantaged status. When does american public worry about their security and economy even personal career? The answer is when they don't have a faith and just mind of how economy run, and most of the time, when they are too lazy to make themselves better. Fear reveals more than it looks like. 
Long live america, all men are created equal.
