Noreen Kellner I have already commented on this proposed rule but would like to make a statement regarding many of the other comments I have been reading. This is a U.S. Government site regarding our laws and regulations. I find it inconceivable that our government would allow foreign citizens to comment on here in an effort to further their own agenda.
