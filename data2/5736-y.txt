Sally Shen I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.Firstly, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Secondly, the competition between students may be exist, but it makes American students study harder than before. It is a good thing.
