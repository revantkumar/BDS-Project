I believe this is a great proposal. There are hundreds of thousands of students flying in to the US from other countries to study. This brings in a lot of money. We (as international students) pay a tuition which is much higher than what locals pay, the locals have more job opportunities since not all companies have he capability to sponsor a visa. Also, certain jobs require clearances which can be acquired only by locals. Also, not having an extension would be a huge loss to the nations economy and a huge failure in our efforts towards globalization. 

I believe people from these STEM fields deserve to get an extension and get an opportunity to work.
