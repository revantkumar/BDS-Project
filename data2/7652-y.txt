Curtis Burke There are many employees in tech companies are working under this OPT extension. The OPT STEM extension helps the economic blooming in the United States. It cannot be denied that the international employee plays an important role in these companies. Without these extensions, many great technology employee will have to leave the country and so will the profit. I think the extension STEM OPT helps both the F-1 students and U.S. companies.
