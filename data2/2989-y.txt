Xinchen Liu I strongly support this proposal. This decision will help 1000,000 international students avoid being forced to leave USA after graduation. If this decision is released, tons of students will be attracted to study in US, otherwise, they will not consider study here, because, they will leave the country almost immediately after graduation anyway. Tuition paid by those students will definitely help improve America's economics.
