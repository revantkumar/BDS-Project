Zack Goodweather I support this new policy.
People cannot equate OPT with the general immigration problem. OPT is very restrictive - only granted to those who have studied in a US institution. It is not even immigration. It is funny that US allows a lot of illegal immigrants to come to this country for free but does not give qualified people who are anxious in creating value for the United States to stay. 
International students help us built this great nation.Although some of them are doing our jobs,more are creating enployment for us. It is not an advisable for us to prevent them from our country.
