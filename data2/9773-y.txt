Crawford Garrison I am already watching my children's future being flushed down the toilet and destroyed. I have watched over the last near 7 years as the standard of living has purposefully been lowered by an out of control President, Obama. I have watched as law-abiding, tax-paying Americans are suffering needlessly as that standard of living lowers more and more, as quality jobs based on merit and birthright are being stripped away, shipped into foreign countries, and given to foreign invaders-- And even worse, those same Americans are being forced to foot the bill for their foreign replacements.

Americans MUST first in America. Stop training foreigners and giving American jobs to foreigners. Stop selling out America to foreigners. Stop it! These atrocious rules by Obama and DHS must be stopped, before the country is entirely lost.

The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.

Obama said he would fundamentally change America, and he has done so, turning a once great country into a Banana Republic with no rule-of-law, favors to his friends and pet political groups, a destroyed economy, no job growth, aiding and abetting the invasion of our country by foreigners, many who hate America, and gouging, abusing and destroying the middle class with unending rules and regulations and Executive Orders designed to do such.
