I strongly support the rule for following reasons:
1. It shows respect to American spirit which gives the equal right and chance for each person. Those foreign students also should enjoy the opportunity to have more time to practice their skills.
2. It can enrich American Culture, as those students invite different culture and knowledge into states, which opens a door for American young generation to acquire more about the world.
3. It thrive the economy. Those talented students also contribute a lot to the society. Take Chinese students as an example. Playing a important role in trade between USA and China, they have positive influence on economy.
