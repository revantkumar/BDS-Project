As you said, you have so many years of experiences and great history, why are you still afraid of competition? You can find a very great job. If the employer didn't employ you just because of the foreigners, then unfortunately it means you are not competitive enough. The best way for you is to improve yourself, not rely on the regional protection. Now under the globalization circumstance, no one can stay in a place that is free from competition but can still get great welfare. 

The country need all the elite people disregard of their origin. If everyone can improve himself and done job better, the company can go better and provide more job opportunities than before. Everyone can benefit from this. Don't be short sighted. 

Best wishes to you!
