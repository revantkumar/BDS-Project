As an American MBA graduate, I find it ridiculous that so many of my classmates (many of which are dual MS-MBA) are being told by the US government that they aren't welcome. These students receive job offers at prestigious locations, working in finance or consulting. They are smart and qualified and we, as a country, should feel honored to have them in our workforce. They were trained in America, they want to help America grow, and we tell them to no. Please vote to change this rule. Even an extension from 17 to 24 months would make a difference.
