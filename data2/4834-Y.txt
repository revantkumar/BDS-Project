I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. university stay in the country for a longer time so that they can make more contribution to the U.S.
2. Diversity is important for U.S., and many great accomplishments are obtained by international students.
3. Competition is required for the development of all kinds of technology
