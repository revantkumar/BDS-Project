Totally support the regulation! Don't forget what makes USA one of the best countries in the world! Diversity culture, respect, creativity and equality! It's funny to see so many US citizens cursed and blamed their unemployment on "foreigners" who paid the same tuitions to college, work much harder to achieve their American dreams, respect and help each to obtain mutual improvements. 

Don't emphasize that you are a citizen of USA and acting like you paid lots of taxes for USA. To be honest, I seriously doubt what contributions you made to this nation.
