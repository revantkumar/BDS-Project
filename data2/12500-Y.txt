This proposal should be greatly appraised. In the past century, US has maintained its global influence in the world by defending the human rights of everyone. Everyone should be treated with dignity no matter what his/her background is. Moreover, US needs this diverseness of cultural backgrounds to spread its essential values to the world. If all these young international graduates are treated with lies and lack of empathy, it will do more harm than benefits to the US fellows. For example, most international students are paying much higher tuitions in order to keep more domestic students receiving their education in schools. Offering recent graduates an opportunity to get work experience at US companies also benefits these companies and the society. The approval of this rule will also attract more talented students coming in and thus maintain US's global competitiveness. In such a high-tech society, one innovation could usually change the world.
