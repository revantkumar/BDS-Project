I strongly support the Extension of students with STEM majors to 24 months.

First of all, students who can find a job in US with STEM degrees are really excellent students. They can do a great contribution to the U.S. economics. The opportunity for jobs should be fair to the public, including international students. If they can do a better job than most of the citizens, why we can't give them a better chance working in US? We all know, justice is a main character for US culture. Why we can't give excellent students the same chance working in US.

Second, the students with STEM majors are not going to competition with US citizens since STEM majors all focusing on very hard works, like computer programming. There are only very few US citizens working on such fields. So why the public concern about this proposal?

In summary, I strongly recommend that US should encourage this extension for students.
