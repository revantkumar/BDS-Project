I strongly support this proposal. It helps to attract more international talents to study and contribute to America. 
The international students who are going to have OPT and OPT extensions are usually top students from their home country. We should encourage them to come to America and contribute to America. A lot of students choose America over other countries because we provide good policy for them to work in industry after they graduate. If OPT extension is no longer available, they may not want to come anymore. 
Competition exists. These international students are quite competitive. But we shouldn't forget that competition makes people better. Introducing competition helps America to stay competitive in certain fields.
