Personally, I admit that I will be the benefit recipient if the 24 months extension get approved formally. I will potential have more chance to find a job in the U.S. But what I want to point out is that we, as new comers, are not coming to steal job opportunities from local people, we are here to learn the modern tech and knowledge from getting involved in the real business world after graduation. We want to start from here to serive the whole human being. It is also the mission of all the people what are standing at the frontier of this world. We help each other at first, then we grow up to be stronger together, finally, we take the role of game changers and influencers to sevice the human being.
