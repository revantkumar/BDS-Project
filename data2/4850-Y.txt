I am an international student from China. I think the effective and instant communication in science and technology field is very important and can boost new technology that might change our world. I would support this rule strongly because I believe this would enable better collaboration and help distribute resources more properly. And as the economy is driven forward by technology growth, the society can provide more jobs and this is supposed to be a healthy economy.
