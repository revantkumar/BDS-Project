Jiaju Jin We support this proposal totally. Why?

Firstly, it is a great benefit for U.S. because these students are all highly educated. Those who apply to the extension all get at least MASTER degree. They have ability to make contribution to this country. Secondly, those people who disagree with the proposal, what they think is stupid. Without competition, it is impossible to make progress.Image that if there is no Nadal, Federal can be so strong in so many years. If there is no competition, can NBA be so wonderful. The answer is absolute NO.
Thirdly, the extension is just a change, everyone still has the equal opportunity to get the job.

So, the proposal is very sensible, for people, for this country, are both benefit. We support this proposal unconditionally.
