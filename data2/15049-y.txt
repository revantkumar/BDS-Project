Liz Shepard Americans are being replaced by foreign workers for NO reason other than votes and cheaper labor( also because the illegals and other foreigners have no investment in this country, and are uneducated, untrained and willing to do as they are told by the company's who hire them; such as who to vote for); all the while Americans are funding the Welfare and social services that the families of these workers receive ( which is illegal and being broadcast on TV in South America by our Government/free food,medical etc if you come to america)and even more immoral and evil the government is taking from Americans social security to fund so called training programs etc. for foreigners and illegals ,this is all taking place because of government wants to form the North American Union. Many trade agreements have been passed without the knowledge or consent of the american people that have opened our border. We now have government that runs our country like their own personal corporation with absolutely no regard for safety,prosperity or the will of the people.NO North American Union/Close the border/enforce immigration laws/ JOBS TO AMERICANS!!!!!!!!!!!
This country needs t return to one for the people by the people /not for the government and their lobbyist /corporations!!!
