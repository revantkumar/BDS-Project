The fact that many educated people have stoped looking for work should say,"STOP THIS NOW"! The fact that a larger percentage of working age Americans are out of the work force than at any time in our history should say "STOP THIS NOW"!. If the Congress of the United States really had any compassion for their fellow Americans they would stand up an say "STOP THIS NOW"! and they'd help to rebuild America back into the great country we once were.
