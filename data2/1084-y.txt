Harrison Xu I am currently a student working at auto industry and I believe the 24-month STEM OPT will bring benefit to the US market. Nowadays, a lot of supplier and factories are located outside US, and the increasing amount of international students with related knowledge can help a lot on the rapid growing of the auto industry.

It should work similar in all kinds of occupations. As the global economic market grows,
more people with multiple background will be largely needed at US. In this condition, most of them come to US pursuing further education, this is the best method to combine knowledge with real world.

Please take serious consideration of the 24-month STEM OPT.

Regards!
