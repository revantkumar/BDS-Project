Ashwini Nalage Students like me pay huge funds in fees to complete 2 years Masters (STEM) Education, coming from the country where it takes so long time for our parents to earn that money, for some families, it is lifetime savings. The STEM field businesses definitely need more than only classroom training because of the most of these fields are at peak of innovations. Extending OPT period from 17 months to 24 months will definitely make STEM students to get that in depth practical exposure and make them capable to contribute in their field not only in USA but outside USA too. I think it will make/keep definitely USA a top place of innovation on earth, but will do good to whole man kind.
