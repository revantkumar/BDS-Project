I definitely support this proposal. international students should get more opportunities to practice the knowledge and skills they get from university. Using the knowledge and skills at work is the objective of education. Furthermore, a long opt extension could attractive more talented students from all over the world, which will contribute to improve the education in america. Thanks to the tuition given from international students, many universities especially public universities could improve the facilities and educated local students better.
