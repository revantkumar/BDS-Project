As a STEM student myself I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the good of industry. 
I communicate and cooperate with my classmate a lot,both international and local, and according to my observation it's just absurd to blame international STEM student for difficulty of employment. The competition about job of big company like Google is fierce indeed, but the whole industry is still hungry for more talent engineer. Local STEM student are doing well and they usually get ideal employment easily, still they alone simply can't satisfy the appetite of a fast-growing high-tech industry, where international STEM students make great contribution. Actually diversity is the key of a health IT industry, the cooperation between engineers from different country inspire innovation and evolution thus keep the industry developing at a high speed. 
International STEM students have nothing to do with the unemployment rate, on the contrary their contribution in high-tech industry create more employment for other American citizen in long tern. As I mention below local STEM students are popular among company for their identity and usually have no difficulties finding their ideal job, competition exist but mainly among international STEM students for great job like Google or Facebook.There are also opportunities in smaller company which have few local alternative if we simply refuse all STEM student, while give international STEM students extra time for finding job no wonder make win-win condition both for those company and students.
If there is really something we should concern about to improve the unemployment issue for STEM students, it's the communication between company demand and students. STEM students prefer to restrict their view on big city and big company for their limited time of OPT, but there are also opportunity in smaller place and smaller company. With an extra extension for OPT international STEM students have greater chance to make their contributions to America.
