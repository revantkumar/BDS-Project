My purpose in writing is to stand up for all STEM students in our country, all computer programmers and techs who might lose their jobs due to the Homeland Security's ;plan to allow thousands of foreign students and workers to enter our country and be hired at lower wages than American workers. The companies t hat hire them will not be paying payroll taxes nor Social Security. I see this as a very un-American sabotage on Americans. This is economic suicide to the United States. There is no need to hire foreign workers. We have a labor shortage. I would urge the ICEB to scrap this plan and not undermine the American people.
Thank you. Patricia LaPointe
