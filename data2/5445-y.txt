Sriram Vamanan Tirunellai I strongly support this rule. I, like many others have come to this country, investing a lot of money in the high quality education that universities in the US promise. In terms of work experience, the US has the best quality of work to offer and I think it's safe to say that non immigrant students like me deserve to have such opportunities. I don't agree with the people who think that this rule will mean taking away jobs from Americans. Organizations in the STEM field will hire individuals who are a good fit for the jobs they want to fill, the nationality of that individual is not relevant to them. Being denied of such opportunities simply based on citizenship and immigration status is not right.
