This is a slap in the face to the thousands of American citizens who cannot find work. The OPT is an obvious ploy to encourage the hiring of foreigners instead American citizens.

By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Obama Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.
These proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.
The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.
I urge you to consider issuing a moratorium on OPT approvals until the program was secured and students could be located. 
OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.
