Audrey Li The OPT STEM extension will benefit US economy in several ways.

First, the majority of jobs that require a STEM major are in urgent needs of hiring but couldnt find adequate job candidates. The supply of students in STEM major if not counting international students could not meet the demand. The extension of OPT STEM work authorization will allow international students to work in the US after graduation for 24 months longer, which will help to meet the gap between supply and demand.

Second, the majority of jobs that require a STEM major are in tech/science area, which is the fundamental of innovation in the US. US has been leading in emerging technology and innovation in the world largely thanks to the ability to attract talents from all over the world. If obtaining work authorization becomes a huge obstacle, it will set up the entire industry and these talents will go to other countries such as UK, Canada, or go back to their home countries such as China and India. In the long run, US will eventually lose its leading position.

Third, contrary to some people wrongfully believed, the students working on OPT visa pay every penny of taxes and dont not receive any special trainings not offered to their American peers. And the jobs theyre taking are not stealing from Americans. Those jobs couldnt be filled by American due to the supply and demand gap mentioned above. Theyre contribution to the US economy.

In summary, OPT STEM extension will create a win-win situation for the US economy, many major US tech firms, and international students.
