- I truly support this STEM extension rule because this will give international students more opportunity to get real time experience in world's largest IT industry and by using this opportunity we can serve better to this industry.
- United states is doing outsourcing of work because they don't have enough human resource in Tech industry. In order to resolve this problem they are providing scholarship to international student to attract them to come to united states to study so that they can get skilled worker for future. 
- Students who have 1 year OPT as a work permit don't get hired as easily as H-1 holder, green card holder or as citizen of united states because most companies here in states don't want to hire people whom they have to sponsor to stay here. 
- This STEM extension will give international student chance to stay here for as long as 3 years which will improve our chance to get job in industry.
- According to me and international student community in here this is the best step that DHS took for development of IT industry and helping immigrants to work in this country.
