I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. There are lot of super famous people in US now who were international students graduating from U.S. universities. They make huge contributions to the country. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International students are doing some jobs which can not find good match of natives with low salaries Competition improves the standard level and help attract better talented person It is a good thing for natives and international students. In the end, it will enhance the U.S. global competitiveness.

So again, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
