Brian Liddell This rule is a complete farce and waste of tax payer money. Rather than fix the H1B visa program (really fix it) the administration comes up with another quick fix that will actually do more harm than help to the American workforce. As stated by many this will be another unenforced give away to corporations.Daniel Costa, the Economic Policy Institute's director of immigration law and policy research, said the worker protections included in the new rule "are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way." Why not spend this money on American schools and students rather than subsidizing corporations with unnecessary deduced cost labor. "The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT," John Miano said, "However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit."
