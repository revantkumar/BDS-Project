Rachel Mckay I do strongly support the OPT extension plan. We all know that the talent foreign people make a huge contributions on the recovery of American economics. As a HR of a 500 fortune company, I know the detailed policy of OPT. For OPT holder, company should pay a required salary in order to apply the work visa for them so that there is no influence on American people job market since the salary for OPT holders is not cheap.Also, they always have strong technical and science background and they always work hard to make things better. America still needs a plenty of STEM talents no matter they are citizen or foreigners. American Government should enact new plan to help American to find STEM jobs but not push all talent foreigners out America.
