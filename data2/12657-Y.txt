I think the OPT extention for STEM degrees can bring opportunities to F1 students with STEM degrees and the US companies. However, this country needs talent not only with STEM degrees, but also other degrees. As a nation with more and more cultural diversity, students without STEM degrees can also bring diversity and creativity to the properous land. Under current circumstances, students graduate without STEM degrees are in bad situation due to the CapGap and limited training period after graduation. I strongly ask for longer OPT period for all students, and remove the CapGap, so that this country can attract more talented people from different background.
