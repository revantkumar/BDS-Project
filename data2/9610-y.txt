Anonymous Anonymous It's important for the United States to keep highly skilled, US trained international students in the US after they graduate. Our country is built based on immigrants especially those with skills. Giving them opportunities to stay and learn valuable skills helps our economy and attract them to stay. If we don't have any policy to let them stay, they will go to other countries such as Canada or Australia. That will be our lost to educate them but let them go benefit other countries.
