Chris Huang I agree with this proposal. First of all, I'm surprised by the comments submitted by some "proud" American citizens that they are sort of anti-immigration! America is an immigration country!I believe this proposal will help US economy by enhancing the core competence.

It's essential for America to keep competitive in the new century by keeping talented people. Those F1 students who are competitive in the job market deserve the same opportunity as Americans in a reasonable time period after graduation. I believe 3 years would be a good proposal, otherwise so many talented and competitive foreigners will be forced out of this country.
