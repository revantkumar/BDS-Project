Simple - for once - consider the American citizen. Put America first just once in your tenure. I struggle as a single parent to pay out of pocket expenses for my daughter's college, even though her father and I paid for the prepaid college plan, which now barely covers tuition. That was a struggle for me to complete after her father died. Yet illegals and legal aliens get greater benefits than she does. Even though she works and goes to school. After all your specially created benefits, my net pay is back to what it was in 2009 - when you took office, and the cost of living has increased. Especially food which is required. My insurance covers less and costs three times as much. Illegals get better medical and Social Security than my father did who worked hard all his life, and better than my mother does who is 80 and only just retired at 79 because she could not afford to live on and get proper medical care on the benefits she was receiving without her employment. Neither of them ever took a dime from anyone that they did not earn. I know you do not know what any of that is like. But even black American students suffer here under your policies and allowing this run away immigration to continue on any level is shameful at best. To allow immigrants the same or better benefits than those who actually pay for all the benefits is pathetic, shameful, and will be a strike on your mark in history. It reinstates slavery for blacks, and puts all races in this country under vassalage. Reconsider your history and the legacy you will leave on your own children, and your children's children. They too will have to live with the results of your policies.
