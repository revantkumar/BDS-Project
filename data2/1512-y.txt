Jayati Pande I completely Support the F1 OPT STEM extension proposal. I strongly believe that this extension is necessary in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics since it takes a longer time for students to work on a project in STEM fields and for these projects to bear fruits. I believe 1 year is far less for the amount of money a foreign student spends in education in the US and they should be given an opportunity to pay off their loans find employment to enrich their experience and learn from it, students in STEM fields are already smart, focused and would constitute the best employees with fresh thinking bringing in foreign experiences and taking with them wealth of knowledge when they return to their own countries. This F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months is very important part of immigration reforms as well.
