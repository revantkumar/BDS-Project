Bill Schurr Hello,
I work in IT for one of the largest insurance corporations in the United States. Actually to be more specific, I work for a staffing agency that provides services (people) for said insurance company. I graduated college in 2008 and have failed to get hired as an internal employee at the company, however my contract is renewed year after year, proving my work is worthy of employment. 

During my tenure I have watched foreign workers get hired over Americans time and time again. Given that I have befriended many of these people, they have told me that they send large sums of money back home to their familey. They are not spending it here. They are not helping our economy. They live a very limited lifestyle to save money for their families back in india. 

When I ask them how they get hired, they tell me they lie. They say Americans are too honest and then they go on to tell me that I should lie to get hires. I for one wasn't raised that way and refuse to accept that reality. I shouldn't have to lie to get hired over foreign born people.

STOP providinging more incentives for employers hire foreign born workers. It is hurting our economy and adversely affecting our newest members of the workforce.
