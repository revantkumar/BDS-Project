I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

Diversity is very important for the U.S, and after learning knowledge in US universities, having a job related with our major is very important.

We know maybe many people think one year (12 month) OPT is enough, in the past, it is true, but now, the HIB quota is limited, and we only have one chance to apply for the HIB lottery, so the extension is important to us.
