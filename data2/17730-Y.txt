I strongly support the extension of OPT for STEM students and Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 students. This act will undoubtedly attract more eligible and brilliant international students to America, thus enhancing America's research level and industrial power in the long run. Besides, it will also provide international students with better opportunities to hone their practical skills after graduate. To conclude, this extension will be a win-win situation for both US and international students.
