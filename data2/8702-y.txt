Zihao Liu I think it is pretty important for the american industry to extend the OPT to 24 month, because through this way, United States could attract more excellent international students who could become the major source of the technology innovation. Besides, this proposal could provide a good environment of competition for the STEM based companies. The companies need to provide more wages, better working condition, and more competitive prospect, which can profoundly motivate the development of the innovation in this country even for the whole world. Meanwhile, if the OPT can be extended to 24 months, more international students come to this country,and it will promote the cooperation between the U.S. and other major countries such as China, because all of the international students from China would become a strong bridge between these two countries. It will produce more communication and cooperation.
