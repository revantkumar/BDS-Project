I totally support this rule. As an international student, I am not support this just for my own benefit, but for the benefit of American society. As I am in the engineering field for several years, I know there are how many international workers in Silicon Valley now and I know the IT companies cannot get today's achievements without their contribution. I do not think they can all be replaced by Americans. Besides, we all know science and technology constitute a primary force especially in the internet and information society. I am sure if there is no opt extension there will be bad influence on the economy even the whole society. America will lost a large amount of skilled professional workers who may bring more job opportunities in the future. So I do not think it is wise for both the benefit of America and international students to cancel this. This is a totally win-win rule.
