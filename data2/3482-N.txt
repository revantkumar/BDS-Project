The United States is NOT obligated to train or hire foreign students in the American workforce. We should and must be loyal to our bright and eager to learn/work American people. STOP the incentive to recruit foreign students, as this is not benefiting our financially hurting country. American citizens need and want those well-paying jobs!

Everything proposed in the OPT of foreign student recruitment is Anti-American and traitorous.
