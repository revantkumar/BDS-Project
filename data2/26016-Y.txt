I definitely support STEM OPT extension. 

1. Americans are already considered first among most companies with the benefit that no future H1B visas is required. Those company who hired international students because they are better fit, not because they are international students. 

2. The proposal can actively encourage international students to apply and study in US. If they are asked to leave right after their degree completed or just given 12 months, which a lot companies won't even consider hiring. Why should they come and pay for the high tuition and fees here? Who would stimulate America's economy? They could actually choose Europe, Australia and other countries with better benefits after graduation and lower tuition.

3. International students did stimulates the American's economy. No mention high amount of expenditures on travelling. If they are given equal opportunity to work and live here. They also buy houses, cars and many other goods to promote business on all fields. 

4. American is an open country. Why not open and focus on the benefits that international students bring, which is much more than the disadvantages most people who oppose the proposal.
