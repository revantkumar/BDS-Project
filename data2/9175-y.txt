Xiao Han, Carnegie Mellon University From the economic perspective, if there is no OPT extension, few companies will be eager to hire students if they will have a 70% chance leave in one year. And it will let fewer international students apply for U.S schools. Almost half of the income for universities come from international students. International students are paying a lot more expensive tuition for the school and without this income the school will collapse. That's why all universities are eager to admit more international students every year, because the federal government is poor.

And international students will also boost local economics, in our apartment almost half of the tenants are international students, and local stores are crowed with international students. If there is no students coming in, who will fill up those apartments and go shopping.

US students have adequate opportunities in high tech area, there are a lot of companies only hire citizens instead of international students like the Boeing company and FBI. And when hiring international students, companies usually need to pay for H1B sponsorship and green card sponsorship as well, it takes a lot of resource and a lot of small companies prefer citizens instead of international students.

And international students, when working with companies, they pay taxes as well. And always because of their short credit history, they usually pay higher fees and insurances.
