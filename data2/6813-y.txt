hongting liu I strongly support the STEM OPT extension because:
1, Before I chose to study abroad, I had serval options. Some of my friends went to Europe such as German, and some of them went to Australia and New Zealand. I decided to pursue my Master's Degree in US because it not only provided one of the best higher education, but also give international students a chance to do optional practical training which can be as long as 27 months for STEM students. This policy attracting many international students coming to US, bring up consumption and helping raising US economy.

2, As a graduate students, I've known many international students determine to do research/development work after graduation. Normally, a project lasts for 24-36 months. A 12-month OPT is far too short to finish any research projects. For those people who do not apply H1 visa or seek for permanent residentship, a OPT STEM extension is very necessary.
