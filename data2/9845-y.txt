Madhu Ch Indeed a commendable move by DHS. I strongly believe every student must be given equal opportunity to demonstrate their skills acquired through their Master's degree and this is possible only by allowing them to compete on a fair basis. There have been many instances where employer would not even consider the resume just because a student is an international and they don't want to get into the burden of sponsoring us. That leaves us with hardly a fraction of options to pursue. 

Coming to the E-verify participation, they are many employers(including major players) who are not the participants in the program. Taking advantage of this situation and the helplessness of students, there are many so-called E-verified employers that are sprouting up in every nook and corner. Their only job is to place the students and get a share for doing so which is indeed frustrating. 

I humbly request DHS to please make the E-verify rule a flexible affair or suggest alternatives to prove the authenticity of the employment.
