I highly support this rule. All comments mentioned good things of the extension. However, some citizens exclude international students because international students complete with citizens in the job market. But US is the country welcoming all people in the world. But foreigners complete water, transportation and even fresh air with US citizens. Should US excludes all foreigners? Indeed, international students take some resources from citizens, but their contribution to the US high-tech industry is much important than what they take from citizens.
