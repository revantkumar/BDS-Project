I am strongly opposed to any expansions of the program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.
I can see no reason why American businesses should be incentivized to hire foreign students over American students. 
I hope you will reverse any considerations to expand OPT. Thank you.
