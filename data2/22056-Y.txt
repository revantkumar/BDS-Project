I strongly support the extension of OPT. United State is a country of high diversity. And a great part of reason why foreign students are attracted to US is the OPT rule. They want to gain working experiences here before they go back. If the extension of OPT is abandoned, there will be a huge impact on university admission. What's more, many companies need excellent foreign students for technical positions. If the extension of OPT is abandoned, there is definitely a huge impact to the development of a lot of companies. The universities and companies can't not afford the risk.
