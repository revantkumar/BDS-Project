Susan Sanchez I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. American college graduates should be first in line for this training and jobs. Uphold our American Immigration Laws pertaining to foreign students. F-1 visa holders are not allowed to hold a job after graduation, and they promise to leave within 60 days of completing their coursework. This law should pertain to all foreign students. The OPT program should be cancelled.
