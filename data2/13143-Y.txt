Extending OPT for another 24 months will definitely help US improve its competency in getting in more international students. Many international students are struggling with VISA problem when they graduated from the college. Some of them are really talented, however, the states lose those talented people because they don't have legal identity to stay in and work for the states. We have spend a lot of resource, a lot of human force to educate those people, but we end up with sending them back and letting them contribute for other countries rather than the states, who offer to educate them. This is a great loss!!

Also, earlier Euro and other regions all have published better policy to get in talented students and have them contribute for them by having residence policy allowing them to stay after graduation. Many international students have take this factor into consideration when applying for colleges. If US doesn't take action to help student solve VISA problem after graduation, we will lose our competency in recruiting international students.

Although, I do agree this increase pressure to our native citizens on job market, but remember, competition help all to improve. Conservation will make situation still or even worse. Highly recommend to pass this policy to improve the states to be more competitive.
