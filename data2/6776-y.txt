Larry Lee I strongly SUPPORT this OPT extension, for the following reasons:
1. These F-1 students help U.S. keep her lead in technology and engineering. These foreign students are the elite from all over the world, and they contribute a lot to the growth of U.S. in multiple areas. We cannot afford to lose this power.
2. These F-1 students are not stealing jobs of regular U.S. citizens. In STEM related companies, they can never hire enough talented individuals, and we just don't have enough STEM citizens. These F-1 students are filling in this hole for U.S. so that we can keep running ahead of the rest of the world.
