The Department of Homeland Securit! y has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans

Really!! The federal government of the USA is giving incentives to corps. to hire NON US CITIZENS graduates over AMERICAN CITIZEN graduates.

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!

Well, NOT REALLY when you look at all the other ANTI-AMERICAN incentives/laws 
put forth from this administration.

PLEASE, go find your BRAIN, you really need it???!!!!
