I believe this OPT extension will be beneficial for attracting international STEM students and in the long run for the economy of this country. Making the economy better is not about how to divide the cake. It is about how to make the cake larger. Tech industries related to STEM programs are at the front of technical innovation and economic growth. We always need more creative minds here. Diversity begets creativity. Extending training opportunities for these STEM students not only gives them more time to practice what they learned, it also increases the possibility for them to stay in and make contributions to the tech industry of this country. Together with U.S. workers, I believe these people will create more job opportunities and make the economy better.
