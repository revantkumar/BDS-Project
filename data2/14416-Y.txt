I SUPPORT the OPT extension. Most of the negative comments here are saying only one thing: the jobs were taken from U.S. stem workers and students. The fact is that, if there were no international STEM students, U.S. can't fill the market. Please face the truths:
1) THE MARKET IS LARGE. When all U.S. stem workers won't drive the current growth in tech industries. 
2) U.S. now has the lowest ever unemployment rate since 2008 crisis. I can't see a fact that support the point that "these jobs should be given back".
