I support the proposal. 

I am teaching English as a second language in a community college. I know lots of foreign students very well. Asian parents are usually very willing to invest children's higher education, and the motivation of doing this is that they believe their children will obtain advanced career and technology training in U.S. Shortening OPT extension will definitely hurt the higher education in U.S. Foreign families will be no longer enthusiastic in studying in U.S. if they don't have the chance to gain some practical experiences after graduation. We will lose the brains and investments.
