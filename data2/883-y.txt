Robinson Samuel For those who oppose to this rule for the reason of keeping jobs for Americans, have you seen a company prefer to hire a foreigner rather than an American with equal qualification? The only reason you are not hired is that you are not qualified! Comparing to you who is working 6 hours a day including your mandatory coffee time at 3 pm, those foreigners are working 12 hours everyday even on Christmas! Do you wish the new law of American job market to become "survival for unfitness"? "In my word you got right, or you got eliminated!"

Please be noticed that I am not speaking for foreigners but just for those Americans who live in fantasy. If everyone in the United States blame their own laziness and incapability to foreigners, this country will fall! 

Final comment for those who hide themselves in the shelter of "immigration protection": come out to the reality, draw your weapon, fight for yourself, and embrace the life you deserved!
