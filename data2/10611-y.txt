Kollin Peterson OPT Stem has to be existed. If it is cancelled, then the groups who get the most profits are those IT consulting companies, not Americans at all. International students are kicked out of US and leave big hole in software engineering positions. Then Indian IT consulting companies will take advantage of it and bring more and more labor so from Indian. Americans still have not enough technical job opportunities. 
On the contrary, OPt Stem can attract more and more wealthy international students to spend money in US and boost America'/s economy.
