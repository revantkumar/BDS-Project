Valerie Fernandes I am steering my bright child away from a STEM degree because I don't want him to become another unemployed American statistic. Ironically, kid-CEOs are claiming there aren't enough STEM-degreed Americans so they must hire foreigners. Right now that isn't true because there are millions of unemployed Americans who have been laid off in those fields. The problem is that Americans want to be paid a living wage commensurate with their skill and education. Big business prefers cheap H-1B labor and increased profits. They care nothing for hiring Americans and only want more wealth. In the future, there WILL be a shortage of American STEM workers because smart Americans see where the whole industry is headed. What incentive is there to study 5+ years for a difficult STEM degree and rack up an average of $60k in student loans, only to find that here are no jobs for Americans, or the jobs available are at 1980's wages, and know that continued future employment is bleak? This country is going to hell, headed by the elitists and PACs that have bought-out our so-called representatives. Their bottom line is increased wealth for the already-wealthy, and the middle class is the discarded byproduct of that process. These elitists dollars should be outlawed, and the number of H-1B visas should be lowered drastically and used only for extremely specialized talent.
