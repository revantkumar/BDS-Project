It's a big lost for both international students and the US society including universities and companies if the OPT extension for F1 stem students can not go through. Many international students won't go to US to get higher education. Also, the technology workers will be more expensive for most companies need engineering and science students because there will be less stem students graduate. So I agree with that the OPT extension should be effective for F1 students of stem major.
