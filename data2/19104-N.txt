I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. First, this is a rule which by-passed Congress which makes one wonder about how lawful it actually is. Second, this expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
Additionally, please consider that: Last year, the Center for Immigration Studies submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to learn more about the OPT program and its impact on American workers. CIS confirmed that: 497,274 work authorizations were granted through OPT between 2009 and 2015. So, in the past 5-6 years nearly 500,000 Americans have lost opportunities for jobs and on-the-job-training to foreigners...OPT is NOT Practical for America nor for our economy. OPT needs to be ended.
