24 months of OPT extension is too long, and it will hurt American employees. If the foreign students want to practice what they learned in college, the original 12 months of OPT should be sufficient. They still have other options such as the H1B visa or work greencard if deemed necessary. OPT allows many American companies to hire cheaper foreign labor which is harmful to all American workforces. It creates a disadvantage to Americans who want a reasonable pay.
