International students are generally top, selective group of people in their own countries. What they have brought to U.S.A are intellectual property as well as diverse backgrounds which has helped this country's economy tremendously. I strongly support the OPT Extention to 24 month as it allows the students more time to adjust to the society and find job offers.
