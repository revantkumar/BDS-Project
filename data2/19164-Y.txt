I think this is a great move as this will allow the STEM students trained in the U.S. to have more opportunities to contribute to the U.S. where it needs most. It takes much time and resources to train a student with a degree in STEM. The system should allow the country to make full use of this precious resource.

If the U.S. doesn't allow the F-1 non-immigrant STEM students with a degree from accredited schools to have the permit working in the U.S., they will most likely find a job back in their home countries. This will greatly increase the competitiveness of these countries. And the U.S. companies, especially those high-tech companies, will likely to have a hard time to find enough capable employees, even if the U.S universities have trained many qualified students. Consequently, the U.S. companies are forced to be in a disadvantage places and this hurts the U.S. economy.

The new proposed rule will allow the U.S. companies take more advantages of the U.S. education system and increase the global competitiveness of the U.S.
