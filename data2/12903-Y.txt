I strongly support 24 months STEM OPT extension rule.
1. It will attract more talent foreign students to the U.S. for study. In another world, the cutting edge of technology will be kept pushing by the U.S., which will bring capital all around world to the U.S. Furthermore, the students' tuition will devote to U.S. economy growth.

2. STEM graduate students will be working on engineer related jobs, such as programmer, civil engineer, mechanical engineer etc. There is no many U.S. students get involved in these fields. Companies still need more and more engineers to fill in their demands. Cancelling the OPT extension rule will lead to a economy recession suddenly. That's the nightmare for very one who lives in the U.S.

3. Who knows these opposite voices are not given by their own governments. They are more welcome their talent graduate students come to their own country to make their own country economy growth.

Thanks
