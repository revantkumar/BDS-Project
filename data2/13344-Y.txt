I highly support this rule for the reasons following:
1. I believe this is good for the US economic development to have high-quality foreign staff 
work in the science and technology area.
2. It's also good for domestic education to attract more talent foreign students to study in US. The international students always pay a large number of money for the tuition fee and living cost every year, which could promote consumption increase and bring the local government more tax revenue.
