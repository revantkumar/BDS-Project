Shuai Peng I am an international student majoring in Computer Science. I strongly support the OPT extension. In my opinion, the 24 months extension is necessary because:

Firstly, academic and industry project usually last two years or even longer. In fact the research project my research team is currently working lasts two and a half years. And more than half of the research team members are international students, which means that if the OPT extension is cancelled, the research would suffer from lack of experienced researchers and even cannot be finished in time.

Secondly, international students need a sufficiently long time to practise what they have learn from classes and gain a deep understanding of their field of study. When I was applying from graduate schools, it was the opportunity offered by OPT that attracted me to university in United States. If the OPT extension is cancelled, lots of talented students would choose to study in other counties.
