Opportunities are equal for everyone. OPT holders are entering big companies because they are typically in better academic standings and are more qualified for the job positions that requires special skills and techniques. Rather than regarding them as competitors, people should definitely consider how much OPT holders contribute to the U.S. economics and high-tech companies. US-born college graduates are not challenged since United States need way more STEM graduates than domestic STEM majors. If United States cancel the OPT, high-tech companies will lose numerous talents and geniuses that devote their intelligence that domestic students do not typically have. Do NOT forget that the United States is country set up by immigrants. If it does not welcome immigrants with special skills that can greatly improve the economics, what can it rely on?
