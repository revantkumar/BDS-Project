Vanessa Vaughan International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. This will ensure continuous supply of young talented STEM graduates and promote growth of science and technology. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow them to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion.
