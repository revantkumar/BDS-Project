JING ZHAO From some degree, some graduate student will use extended opt time for graduation tavelling. Because once they have been graduated from school, their vaild student visa is determined. As far as I know, most of students do not have time to travel when they were at school for studying. And travel all over the America did need some time. For me, I like travel by self-drive. I spend three weeks to drive from northern michigan to key west which is in florida and during the travel, I have been through over 12 states. We also could get back to china and apply for travel visa to return but it is totally different. When we get back to china, we proably do not have that mood on traveling due to the high-pressure from family to get the job and buy the house. When I am here, I would like to spend money ranther than save it for buying a house in china! OPT extend will definitely push the development of economics. There are so many cultrual thing for international students to explain why they would like to stay a little bit longer in the country which their parents cannot in charge of or control them. When they pass that time they will get back to the place that has plenty of delicous food.
