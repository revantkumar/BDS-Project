As an Engineering Manager, I have usually difficulty in getting naturally born US citizens with advanced degrees to work in these advanced science areas. 

The main reason is that there are just not enough qualified applicants. The ability to get foreigners with advanced sciences degrees from US schools allows companies in the US to become technically competitive than if these students went back to their home countries or countries that does accept them as viable technical assets. 

I do understand the reasoning for this change in rule, but screening these applicants or other methods than just not letting them work for US companies hurts the overall technical competitiveness advantage the US needs to maintain globally.
