I am a Chinese in Canada. Although this Act is seemingly not my business because I am pursuing my fortune in the "True North", I still would like to briefly state my own point of view. The ancestors of modern Americans, mostly Europeans, came to the New Land, leaving everything they had known behind, in order to control their fate, because the spirit of America is like this: it provides a land of freedom where people's efforts, tenacity, and innovation can make the greatest difference to the whole world. Many immigrants, like Andrew Carnegie, Scotish immigrant, and Albert Einstein, German immigrant, made extraordinary contribution to America and the human race, whereas back to their homelands they may probably not make such a greatness, and some of them may even had been killed.

My homeland People's Republic of China is being ruined by the wicked Communist Party, who suppresses a free academic environment and grab value of talents' intelligence by their infamous dictatorship. Daniel Chee Tsui, a Chinese-born American Nobel Prize in physics winner, made great contribution in Princeton, while his parents were persecuted to death in China. If true genius cannot grow in the Free World like America, it will die in the oppression of "Les Miserables"

However, I fully understand that the opportunities of America must be offered to truly qualified people, and I am also aware that many illegal immigrants including large amount of Chinese obtained their opportunities by fraud and lie. For this bunch of people without civility, we should reject their vain attempt. However, I also insist that opportunities should be provided to competent immigrants. This will not squeeze the space for American citizen, but in the opposite it will create more space for them, because new immigrants will be the most active elements and the most powerful propeller of the American society.
