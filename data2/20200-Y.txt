This 24-Months expanding will be excellent opportunity. For years, US trained thousands of F-1 students with strong skill sets, those student made great contribution for this country in all kinds of area, they understaning culturally diverse and know how to deal with it, their innovation always create new ways to solve things. However by the immigration law at this moment, we cannot keep them more than two years. Why we won't keep them longer? If we keep them longer, they can keep making contribution for our country. 

I understand some poeple are hated those students because they thought those students took their benefits, but we should consider this, if they don't make those great contribution, will we have all those benefits? Because they made contribution, so they should deserve those benefits. 

Stop giving those opportunites will result most people go back to their own country and make those country more competitive to the US. Sure, most americans deserve those jobs, but we are making other country more competitive. Think about next 20 years, if other country are getting better, will americans still standing on the top?

So as conclusion, please give this opportunity to those STEM students, we can't afford to lose them. Especially at this moment.
