I think it's very necessary to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degree. Three reasons:
First, Companies need variety of culture, which is consistent with the whole U.S. hybrid of culture.
Second, F-1 Students deserve the opportunities to be trained in U.S. companies after they received their corresponding education.
Third, It should be helpful for the country, because more and more talents from different countries contribute themselves for U.S. benefits.
