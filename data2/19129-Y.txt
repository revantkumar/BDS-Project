I highly SUPPORT the proposal. Bringing a longer fair chance to foreign students, they can show their talented to get a suitable position, which will give an enhancement of America economy. We are all clear that the proposal is focusing on the science technology engineering. And the majority of the American dosen't interest in the area. It won't hurt any American friends. In the opposite, we can cover the shortage of IT talents!!!!
