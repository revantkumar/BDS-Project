As a Postdoc Associate at Duke University I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should allow the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country for a couple of years and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
2. Nearly all the Ph.D students and many of the Master students have scholarship/ fellowship from the U.S university, so allow them to stay in the U.S is beneficial to the U.S, because these students could contribute their intelligence, skills and what they have learned to the development of the U.S.
3. Diversity is very important for the U.S. And STEM students have very strong capability such as programming skill, analytical skill and creation, which are really important for the technology industry, such as IT, internet, auto motor company.
4. Many STEM students are doing a research related job after they graduated, and they have done great job for the university, national lab, research institute.
