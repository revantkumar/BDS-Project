The major reason for those people who are against with this STEM OPT extension is that they think it will increase unemployment. However, this is not true in STEM occupations. According to the following paper, the fact is that unemployment is falling sharply in STEM occupations: The unemployment rate for STEM occupations fell from 4.5% in 2009 to 2.5% in 2012. Those people who are against with this proposed rule should read this paper first to avoid making any wrong arguments.
