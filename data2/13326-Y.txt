I strongly support this rule for following reasons:
As a statistics master degree student, everyone can see that in one statistic related class, there only has limited number of American students there, if most of students must leave US after graduating, US will lose a lot of statistics related talent workers. 
Now, we are in big data era, you can think if you do not have strong power for supporting you, I cannot imagine what you will lose for your future and for US future.
