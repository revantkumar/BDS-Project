Edward Smythe I am writing to support this proposal. 

The United States is the center of technology and Internet-based industry. We need millions of STEM engineers to maintain the development of our businesses. Clearly, F-1 student is a great source of talented people. This is not about giving international students a chance to live in our country, but about a way to make our people live better and live with strong economy. Those who can come to the US were, I believe, the best students in their own countries. There is no reason we reject their help to develop the states. America needs talents. We want international students to join our diversified society, and contribute to the well-being of the US.

Best Regards,
Edward
