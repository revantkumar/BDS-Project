The United States Government needs to be more concerned with the employment of Legal U.S. Citizens and not Foreigners or Illegals! Enough already... we currently have 95 million able bodied, legal U.S. Citizens that have stopped looking for work/are not currently employed due to the rampant Immigration both legal and illegal. Wages for the U.S. Worker are stagnant also due to the rampant Immigration issues.

Half of U.S. College Grads in the STEM fields currently are not working in those fields because there are no JOBS for them. Why then would you enteratin the notion of allowing foreigners to stay longer and take more jobs away from the lawful U.S. Citizen? 

H1B's are filled with fraud by the employers looking to fill positions with cheaper labor..hence they hire the H1B whom is pretty much 'tied" to that employer from that point on for years. It's not fair to them and it's not fair to the American worker.

Tell me how would YOU feel if we (the Amercian People) Outsourced the Bureacratic nightmare that is government workers? How warm and smiley would YOU feel if you had to train your replacement so you could go to the Unemployment line and collect benefits for six months and then you are on your own because the H1B's have taken all the jobs?

Sincerely,
