Quan Pham I am a HR in California, and I totally support this rule, since our company has amount of engineer who are working with OPT time. If they lose their legal working authorization, our company has to hire more engineers immediately, however, some of them are critical in their team, and contributed a lot every day. Some positions can not be easily placed by other people, and I do not think the policy will affect employment rate of citizens, since when I hire engineers, I only care about what abilities they have, rather than their nationality. IF SOMEONE HAS QUALIFIED SKILLS, WE WILL HIRE NO MATTER WHAT NATIONALITY HE/SHE HAS.
