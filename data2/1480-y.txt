wei wu I strongly agree with this proposal.

The equality of human rights, the diversity of different cultures and the inclusive of American society makes USA the wonderland in the world. American people are more opened minded and foreign welcomed. America allows people to share different voices and seek the unknown world beyond the limits. Lots of the professors here are originally foreign students, they come to US to study and then attracted by the beauty of the American culture. So they stay and dedicated their life to share knowledge and build a better America.

Hiring foreign students doesn't mean lose job opportunity for native Americans. Actually, lots of the founder of big companies are originally foreigners and they bring more job opportunity to USA. For example: Do Won Chang, originally born in Korean, the co-founder and CEO of Forever 21; Sergey Brin, originally born in Russian, co-founder of Google. Some of them come to USA as a students, for example: Mike Krieger, originally born in Brazilian, the cofounders of Instagram. He come to Stanford University in 2004 to study symbolic systems. Vinod Dham, originally born in India. He is the "Father of Pentium". He came for MS degree of Electrical Engineering in University of Cincinnati in 1975. 

Hiring foreign students in the company does not meant for cheap labor!
