I strongly support expanding the training opportunities for STEM F-1. It gives F-1 students the chances to get more industry experience and utilize what they learn at school. If OPT extension is cancelled, It's hard for me to imagine will those high-tech industries like Google, Microsoft have a huge impact. Especially for STEM degree, expanding the OPT not only helps the students but also bring great benefit to USA. It's win win. 
Overall, I strongly supported the OPT extension for STEM F-1 students.
