I absolutely OPPOSE this new proposal for allowing foreign students to remain in this country for an even longer time period than they already are allowed to stay. In fact, I am against their being able to train here at all because this allows companies to keep hiring foreigners ad infinitum instead of hiring an American worker.

The title states that it is to improve training opportunities for these foreign students. Why is this government so interested in improving these opportunities for foreigners when American students need the training as well? Don't Americans deserve 
the chance to excel at all costs? Isn't it the government's responsibility to its own citizens first and foreigners last? This proposal does the exact opposite.

To make matters worse, the Social Security Administration wants to cut spousal benefits and yet these companies will not have to pay Social Security payroll taxes on these foreigners. Well, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. If THEY don't have to pay, why should I?
