John Han After 7 years PhD study, I graduated in January 2015, and I am working in a research position in a computer company. If the OPT rule does not change, I will go back China in January 2016. Since I got well education in US and am willing to work here, I do not see any bad side to extend OPT for STEM student. As far as competition with US citizens, a certain level of good competition will keep this country being the leadership in the world. 

There is no doubt that the high educated immigrants should have more opportunities to contribute to this country.
