I'm an engineer works at auto-supplier company. Many young and talent foreign engineers are working here as me. The company pays a lot of money to train us and our skills. And we are trying our best to help the company. The company is trying to make better car product to help people drive safely and comfortably. If this fails, it's a very big loss for the company, the auto industry and the country.
