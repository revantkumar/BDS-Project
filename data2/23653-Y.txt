I highly support this the proposal which would allow such F-1 STEM students who have elected to pursue 12 months of OPT in the United States to extend the OPT period by 24 months (STEM OPT extension). This will give STEM students more time to find a job in the U.S. We have to admit, a lot of excellent employees, especially in computer science, and engineering fields, were F1 STEM students. Several tech companies like Google, Apple, acquired outstanding grads to fill their job openings. Without the OPT extension, a lot of their employees will be forced to leave their jobs. One more question, would the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau mind to consider extend the OPT period for non-STEM F-1 students?
