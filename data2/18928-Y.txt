USA is a nation that is filled with immigrants. These immigrants have naturalized and over time have assimilated in this land's culture, so xenophobic attitude towards people who are working in high research scientific and technical fields and taking part in the progress of this nation is highly hypocritical. Also, shooing away highly skilled and educated people will lead these people to get educated in USA and go and work in their home countries, thereby leading to those countries progress more than USA's. This is one of the reason why China is constantly getting better in recent times to the point of making USA feel threatened. Soon enough India and China are bound to make USA irrelevant as Europe (which once was a superpower but now merely basking in the shadow of past glory). Americans should realize that the immigrants who have come here have not come illegally, and that when work here, they are creating jobs and wealth here, which would otherwise be created in some place else.
