This proposal is not in the best interests of the United States. With the high level of unemployment, the requirement that a student have a job in order to receive an extension is ridiculous!! I understand there is also an incentive for firms to hire these people in that they don't pay FICA and medicare taxes. When you add up the 480 thousand or so employed, we are losing a lot of money that Social Security and Medicare could really use. 

This creates an unfair situation in which U.S. citizens are discriminated against. Please do not go forward with this proposal.
