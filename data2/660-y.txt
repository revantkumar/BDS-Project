Anna Liu I'm not a person of high standing or deep understanding of legal/political issues, but I do know that this is an issue that affects people on a very individual, personal level. One of my closest friends is an international student (now graduated working woman) from China who had suffered so much stress and burden over the issue of whether she'd be able to stay in America, or whether she might be deported, or what would happen after graduation. And which continually decreasing chances for the HPT lottery, it seems to be harder and harder year by year for international students to stay in America.

Why allow STEM students to stay? These international students, representing a greater percentage of the student population across America year by year, are the bright minds of the future. They are intelligent, creative, extremely hardworking, and contribute to the cultural, intellectual, and artistic diversity of America. Let's give them a chance. Let's give them a hope!

Again, I say I don't have much knowledge. But I know I treasure my friend, and I really want her to be able to stay in America! Please approve this proposal!

Thank you,
Anna Liu
