This Administration is literally destroying the ability of the American worker to be employed in this country. Hundreds of thousands have been fired and replaced already with foreign workers. Several tech company have been found to pay only pennines on the dollar to these foreign workers once they get them. It is sickening and disgusting what has happened to this country under Obama. Expand training opportunities for American citizens.
