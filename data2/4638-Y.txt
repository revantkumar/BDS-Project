I strongly support the OPT extension rule because the OPT extension benefits the U.S economy in the long term. OPT extension can attract the most talented foreign students to not only complete their study in the U.S, but also leverage their talents in specialized fields, e.g. science, technology, engineering and math to help U.S stay in the leading position in these fields.
