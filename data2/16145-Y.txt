I strongly SUPPORT the proposal in expanding OPT period for STEM degrees. Reasons below.

1. It is a good thing that these students got degree in US schools can contribute to US companies in return. And these are very competitive employees in most of the companies.

2. STEM degrees are bringing good competition. All industries need competition to keep growing.
