Extending the OPT period of students with STEM degrees is good for both America and the students. The period extension is not only stimulating the industries and boosting the economy of America, looking further, the graduates will also develop a sense of belonging to our country. Offering the privilege to the non-immigrant graduates of staying longer instead of having them return to where they belong in a short period of them will give them a more welcoming feeling that we are not reluctant to have them staying in our country. With this opportunity, the students could have a higher chance of getting a job and settling in here. This act also keeps a number of elites from different countries to be in here, which leads America to be even more competitive in those related fields. Seeing this in a long run, there will be more and more smart and capable professionals accumulating in this country. As a U.S. citizen, I would hold a welcoming and appreciating attitude towards the graduates with STEM degrees.
