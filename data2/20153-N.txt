I am totally opposed to expanding the OPT program to 36 months because it hurts LEGAL American students in the job market here at home. This program was designed to help foreign students when they GO HOME to help THEIR countries, not interfere with legal American students getting jobs. As a legal American citizen I am totally opposed to this.
