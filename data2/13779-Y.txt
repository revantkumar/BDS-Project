SUPPORT OPT EXTENSIONS!!!!
I support the OPT extension for several reasons:
I think it is important for foreign students to learn and contribute to USA after graduate, they get to learn a lot from the universities so they wanna make their contributes as well. Also, USA is famous for its diversity, that's why it becomes the most powerful country in the world. Elites from all over the world makes this country becomes better. Moreover, I think the STEM extensions are only for the fields that demand is much less than the need . Most of the USA residents chose to study business, finance, lawyer or doctor. So among engineering fields, most positions are short of local people. Thats why OPT extensions are very important!!
