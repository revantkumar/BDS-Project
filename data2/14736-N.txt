In the education sector a teacher friend experienced the effects of importing teacher trainees a few years ago. Teachers were imported from Spain at a lower pay rate. My friend was forced to give a trainee her parking place. They were treated with more respect than teachers who'd dedicated their lives to the district for years. I fear that lack of oversight will have a similar outcome in STEM fields.

I'm all in favor of giving foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but agree that today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap....
