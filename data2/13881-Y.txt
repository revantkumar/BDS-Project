This is in response to the proposed rule. I strongly support and believe that this is important and beneficial.Students come here to gain more knowledge in the field and to learn advanced technologies. This rule will help in giving more time in gaining practical knowledge on the theory leaned during the classroom education and also in developing skills. This will also have a positive impact on US economy. On the other hand,if the rule isn't passed and the sudden cancellation of the OPT would impact several international students and U.S economy.
