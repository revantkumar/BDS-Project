In my opinion, this policy is not only good for the immigrant, but also good for America itself. First, as we can see, this policy is applied for only those high-tech and high-professional majors, this would ensure the people will stay longer in America must have above-average quality. They got the chance to work here longer, and they also can contribute a major part of tax for government. Secondly, a lot of technology company, like Google and Apple, hired a lot immigrant with F1 visa. And these people contributed a lot to these company. Because of these people, America company can become the world leader, not only in technology, but also in finance industry
