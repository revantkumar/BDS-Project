Betty Bailey 1024 Hawks Nest I totally agree with the expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students. I will discuss about its benefits in two major points.

Firstly, most companies who are related to STEM majors needs this policy. Companies, especially the IT companies in the Bay Area, needs tens of thousands of newly graduated students per year. In the mean time, there are not enough native Americans who choose these areas as their college majors. With OPT extension, the companies will be able to get much more employees. And this will benefit both the companies and the United States.

Secondly, the extension policy will benefit American people. Nonimmigrant students usually come to American not just for better education, but also for a couple of years of working experience before they go back to their home country. With more students coming to America, there will be more shopping, house renting, and car purchasing. Local people like landowners and car dealers will greatly benefit from this. However, if the extension is not approved, the number of student coming to America will greatly drop due to not being able to work for a reasonable time, and the local people will not be able to benefit from it.

To sum up, expanding the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students will greatly benefit America and the students themselves, thus it should be approved.
