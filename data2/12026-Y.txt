I strongly support the new OPT extension proposal. Here are the reasons.

Firstly, by allowing foreign people to work, America can improve its diversity. A good diversity is a symbol of a country that is powerful, compatible, and responsible, which is proof to the world that America is one of the strongest countries in the world.

Secondly, lots of brilliant people who make great contribution to the society were just foreign students in America. There are many great professors in my University who play a leader role in their study field, and are not American citizen. Just because they have the work authority in America, they can have the opportunities to make great contribution to America and to the whole world.

Thirdly, there may be no competition between foreigners and American citizens. Foreign people can have work authority only for the jobs that cannot find any American citizens who are competent.In other words, American citizens and foreigners are complementary to each other. Foreigners can offer strength to American society where local people are not that good at. Isn't is a win-win thing?

Lastly, even if there exits competition, it is a good thing. With competition, people will have motivation to improve themselves and get better achievements.If everyone is too lazy to make progress and also afraid that others may make progress that surpass him/her, the society will stop develop, which is a disaster for the whole world. So competition is a good thing that push us to move forward. We have the ability to transfer the pressure from competition into motivation.

In all, the new OPT extension proposal will bring way more benefits than harm to American citizens and to foreigners.
