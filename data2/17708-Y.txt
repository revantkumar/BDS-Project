I strongly support the new policy of setting OPT extension period as 24 months. In my opinion, this a win-win situation for students and the United States. I would like to focus on why it benefits the US in my comment.

Students on OPT are becoming a more and more important group in the US workforce. In many large corporations, especially those in tech industries like Google and Apple, a very diverse group of employees can be seen working together on projects. Students on OPT contribute significantly to this diversity. In fact, a large number of my friends who recently graduated, smart and hardworking, are working diligently in tech companies on cutting-edges technologies. Their contribution to the development of technology should not be understated. Therefore, extending the OPT extension period helps them have longer working period, thus helping the tech industry and US economy.

The policy also makes sense in terms of project lengths in tech industry. It is not uncommon to find projects with length of more than one year. Some even extend to multiple years. With a longer OPT extension period, it is less likely for students on OPT to be forced to leave US without completion of their projects, preventing interruptions of research and development of key technologies in industry.
