I strongly support the OPT expansion rule. I am an international student, and I will be working for a high-tech company. The expansion will definitely enable me to contribute what I learned from US institutes to the US economy development and help US to reinforce its leading position in technology. 

When I chose my gradschool, I had multiple choices: Canada (U Toronto), Switzerland (ETH Zurich), Hong Kong (HKU, HKUST), Singapore (NUS) and UK (Oxford and Cambridge). However, I chose to come to US (CMU). All the schools I got listed above are of the same education quality as CMU in the realm of Computer Science. The real reason I chose CMU over those schools is the OPT that USA provides. It can help me, an international student, to better practice what I learned. All international students around me agree this practice is essential and this is an essential reason for them to choose to come to US. US educational institutes definitely benefit from more international students coming to US. The failure of the expansion will definitely deteriorate US's competitivity as a destination for international education.

Moreover, over the years, international students made significant contribution to US economy and technology. The company I will be working for next summer is founded by an international PostDoc researcher. This company's product is revolutionize the visual internet. Actually, there are many such high-tech companies nowadays in US, founded by international students and creating many job positions.

I myself before coming to US, worked for a local company in China. I am experienced in my area and know well about how market work in China. My experience is valuable for enhance the communication and business between US and China, and so are many other international students.

Above are some of my ideas about the rule. I think it is definitely beneficial to both US and international students.
