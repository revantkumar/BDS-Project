I strongly agree with this proposal. Expanding the Training Opportunities for F-1 students can improve the overall economics of the world. It is one of the most significant methods to promote cultural communication and enhance mutual understanding.
To be sure, all the country in the world have many challenges ahead. The most important of which will be to implement economic and culture strategies that can diversify and develop their economies over the long run. Hence, expanding the Training Opportunities for F-1 students not only benefit USA itself, but also promote the harmony of the world.
