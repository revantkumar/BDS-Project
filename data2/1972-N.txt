Do not put Foreigners over Americans. 

Foreigners discriminate against Americans when they do get jobs here. They do not adhere to American ethical standards for treating their fellow workers. They only work with and want to hire their "own kind". There is no way to respond to this horrible act. Only Americans , abide by American fairness and ethical practices in the workplace. We live here, we can't run home to another country and hide. Stop the discrimination now!

We do not need more non-citizen workers . We need to put millions of Americans who fell off the job rolls back to work.

We need to put high school graduates into these new jobs that are created, not put them on welfare.

Why did we fight for our country, if it is not even our country?

Also, stop Foreign workers from responding to this comment section. They are using mass mailers to distort the true numbers. Just like they do when they work in this country. They do not care about the outcomes of their work. They do not feel a need to make America great. (Some do, most don't)
