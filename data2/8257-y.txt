Arvind Chaudhary As a STEM graduate student, I am supporting the extension. With two years extension, I could better apply the knowledge, I learned from the US college to the US industries. It is a win-win strategy. It could attract plenty of smart international students to work in the US and make benefits the US economy. It also follows the spirit of America as an immigration country, this extension will make the best younger generation have more chance to work in the US and the US will benefit from these talents.
