lin Zhao I strongly support this proposed rule since such a win-win strategy for both United State and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. US high tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and growing economy. The high revenue then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. Meanwhile, the growing economy definitely results in more working opportunities. Therefore, people should not be worried about US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries.For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.

Second, it was because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that international student can come in. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if two candidates have the same skill set and capability. US citizen would work without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. So why would companies choose international employees if they have to pay more money?
