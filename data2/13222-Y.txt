As a foreigner, I strongly agree with this policy, not because it's about my own interests but also it connects every person who lives on this freedom land. I heard many noises from domestic, such as "foreigners steal our job". I have to say this opinion is totally wrong. 

Everybody knows the economy of America has been growing slowly for a quite while, and people need jobs here. The reason why government wants to push this regulation is to keep this country growing, to make more job opportunities. Keeping all foreigners away from this land can not save this country. Diversity can make this country more prosperous. Those who major STEM can help this country to create more job opportunities. The government of this country is not silly, it will not expand this regulation if it is bad for American people. So please support this regulation, let's make this nation more better in an American way: freedom.
