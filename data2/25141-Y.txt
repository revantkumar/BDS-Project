I SUPPORT the RULE. I doubt how many people that against this rule can really consider the high-tech labor need in industry. And I seriously doubt do they have the talent to do this job. OBVIOUSLY, citizen can't fill this need even to an tolerantible level.

I'm working in Silicon Valley.
Google's CEO Sundar Pichai is a young Indian. MicfoSoft CEO Satya Nadella is an Indian. According to venture investment company KPCB's newest data: 15 out of 25 American high-tech companies that holding the hugest market value are FOUNDED BY THE FIRST and SECOND immigration generation, including STEVEN JOBS (father is Syrians), and GOOGLE's founder Sergey Brin(born in former Soviet Union). And more and more young talented immigration grow up to be a talented American citizen. Why currently citizen so afraid of the new member? Trust me, even these new immigration don't come, the current citizen will still can't take the job because it's so hard to handle brain storm job that needs so hard working, clear logic, Ph.D. from top university, capable of all language coding, know so well about engineering architecture, research and high EQ-------------- YES its hard to beat. Always, watch and learn is the only way to make United States stronger, and human stronger. Otherwise, there's only one way to go is: America tech company fall behind.

America is a TYPICLE immigrate nation. According to 2013's data, the immigration doubled its population in the past 20 yrs, 1/5 of the whold world's immigration. That's how she becomes the dreamland of people who want to make this world better. 

DO NOT JUST THINK ABOUT YOUR FOOD TABLE. THINK ABOUT THIS CONTRY. ASK YOURSELF WHAT YOU CAN BRING TO THIS COUNTRY.
