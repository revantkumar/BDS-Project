Yong Joon Kim Please approve this new rule. I am a software development engineer in Seattle. In the tech industry, this rule is playing a very important role so that the revocation maybe very harmful. To some extent, the tech giants relies on the foreign new graduate. As far as I know, the foreign students accounts a lot in the new hires of Companies like Microsoft and Amazon. In may team, we got 5 new hires, and 3 of them are the new graduates using OPT and may use extension in the future. If the rule got perished, the hiring bar will be severely affected since these guys are the most excellent ones among lots of candidates. What makes the case worse is that we may face the problems that there are less and less candidates for interviewing. From my experience, there is not too many American students majoring in engineering fields during college. The foreigners are the main resource for this industry. Losing them will directly influence the industry. Besides, there is already a large number of foreigners using OPT extension in these companies. Their sudden left will only make boss crazy since there is not enough guys to finish the assigned projects. And for the companies, they lose lots of experts in different aspects, and the technology commanded by these guys will only be used by the companies in other country. Other country will compete with US and gradually decrease its leading role. Finally, from personal perspective, I do enjoy working with people from all the corners in the world, they teach me a lot and make me feel comfortable.
