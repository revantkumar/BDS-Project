* The proposed regulations blatantly and unfairly benefit foreign workers at the expense of Americans WHO ARE THE ONES BEING FORCED TO FUND IT. The US government should always put legal US citizens first. Any supposed protection for US workers in this proposal is deceptive at best and is inherently unenforceable.

* The proposed regulations are "irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it."

* At a time when the terrorist threat is real and growing, this proposal worsens the situation by opening wide doors to those who would harm Americans. Vetting with background checks and subsequent tracking of individual student/worker participants is already problematic (not really happening). This proposal would significantly increase the problem on all fronts.
