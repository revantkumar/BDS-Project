Michael Liu I totally support OPT extension for below reasons:

Firstly this will make universities of USA more competitive compared to those in Europe, Australia or other states. Being able to work here to practice our industrial skills has been a big reason we give up offers from other countries and decide to attend schools here. And so many international students coming here every year has contributed a lot of money to universities, communities and societies in America. This is really good to American economy. If the OPT extension is banned, I cannot imagine how many international students America universities are gonna lose.

Secondly, the quality and quantity of human being resources in STEM is always deciding how far this country can go. OPT extension is only for STEM and will attract a lot of people really good at technologies and make them contribute to the progress of this great country. 

As summarized, I think OPT extension is very necessary to the United States.
