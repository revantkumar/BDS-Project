I support the new rule proposed. Retaining F1 students makes more sense as it not provides opportunities to international student to gain industry experience but also it helps American economy to stay competitve. A stronger economy is very good any country.Some of the talented international student with great ideas end up opening their own venture, thereby providing more job opportunities for American workers.
