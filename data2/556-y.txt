Indraja Gaddam STEM OPT is absolute necessity for students on F-1 Visa. Removing OPT STEM extention will have a very adverse effect on international students. So many eligible and deserving students will have to go back to their home country without having fair chance at employment after spending so much amount of money for their education. I sincerely urge DHS/US government to take 24 months OPT STEM extension into consideration and re-instate the STEM OPT extension rule.
