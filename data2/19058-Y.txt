I strongly support this new rule.

Considering the shrinking domestic education market and increasing international education market, the opportunities cost of canceling OPT extension is huge: a lot of US universities have to cut its budgets, decrease faculty funding and graduate program funding, which harms the leading status of the US universities. A lot of US companies have to outsource their jobs to overseas, and thus the US government will losses huge taxable incomes.
