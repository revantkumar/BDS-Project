I absolutely support the proposal for the new 24-month-extension of STEM OPT. Three reasons are worthy of mentioning:

First of all, the dominating status of the U.S. in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely owing to the contribution made by millions of scientific and technological talents coming from all over the world for a long time. Therefore, the U. S. should give the international students majoring in a STEM subject stay longer in the country as this can continuously boost the technological and economic development of the U.S. Without their contribution, a lot of domestic industries could not have been so prosperous, such as information technology and computer science.

Secondly, the diversity of the society is crucial and necessary. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices. Moreover, the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings.

Last but not least, someone argues that those international students create intense competition and take place of the job position in the U.S. In face, this turns out to be good time in the long run. The competition can push the majority of our citizens to enhance their skills and can give our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. As we all know, citizens already have a natural edge when competing with foreigners since they do not need sponsorship and they have language advantage. we Should probably blame the elementary education in STEM instead of immigrants! If we let the tremendous amount of skill-equipped human resources outflow from the the U.S. only because of weak competitive power of our citizens, then it will be an unanticipated loss to our domestic companies and to the country as a whole.
