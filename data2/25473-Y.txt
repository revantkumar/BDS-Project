I am an international student who just started studying at Columbia and I strongly support this proposal. I was really shocked when I heard the expansion would possibly be revoked because having a relatively longer time for professional training was the most important reason that I came to US. Although having international students come to US do introduce competitions, it is a positive and benefits US's economy. First, most directly, the tuition fees and expenses by the international students. Billions of dollars were generated by these and colleges also benefit from this. Second, international students who qualify OPT are well-educated, providing more opportunities to them means the probabily of hiring qualified candidates could increase. Third, rejecting this proposal will make huge damage to high tech companies, including those top ones such as Google, Apple, and Facebook. Those tech companies have a large amount of international employees and many of them have gone through OPT. This is a strong indicator that OPT brings positive effects on IT industry and therefore US economy, we should support it.
