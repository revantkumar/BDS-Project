OPTs are sought after by employers because they are usually cheaper than their American competitors.

This program has an adverse effect on American STEM workers who have already seen higher unemployment rates the ever before and stagnant wages. This is especially true among older tech workers. 

The program further drives down wages and discourages American students from pursuing a career in a STEM field. 

Employers supporting the program are only looking for cheap disposable labor. 

Additionally, these company's hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't have to pay FICA or Medicare taxes under this program. 

OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range and cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

This does not benefit American workers or the United States in general. Also, the 9/11 terrorists in the United States held F1 visas. Expansion or support for the OPT program is misguided and is only being used as a way around the H1B quota system.
