I strongly oppose this new regulation. Offering international STEM graduates a 3-year work authorization is totally unfair for American STEM graduates. Since international graduates are likely to accept low-income jobs in exchange for the right of staying in the U.S. (the greatest nation on earth) legally, the employers will discriminate against domestic STEM graduates in the hiring process since domestic graduates require reasonable wages. 

Research from scholars like Dr. Norman Matloff (http://www.epi.org/publication/bp356-foreign-students-best-brightest-immigration-policy/) has found that international graduates are "de facto servant" of their employers since they are losing legal status in the U.S when losing their jobs. This new regualtion only allows internationals graduates to be unemployed for very limited number of days in the 3-year period. Thus, this new regualtion gives no freedom to international graduates and only provides employers more chances (and for a longer period of time) to enjoy the cheap labor and discriminate against U.S. workers.

The one-year work authorization for practical training, which is set by law, is long enough for international graduates to gain some U.S. work experience. Those who are interested in working in the U.S. for a longer period of time should apply for working visas, like h1b visa. The Congress has set a quota for the maximum amount of working visas that can be issued for a reason. It is unreasonable to pave the way for STEM graduates to avoid the working visa application process, which is required for everyone else who are interested in working in the U.S. The new regulation is totally against the principle of equity and is a trick to disobey the immigration laws set by the Congress.
