Honestly I believe the new proposal for extending the OPT for eligible F-1 students will definitely benefit the American economy:

Let's think about what's the key aspect in supporting the U.S economy, the answer is technology. So take a look at the majors in STEM degree list, most of them are related to computer technology, chemistry, biology and so on. The techniques in those fields are the fundamental power in boosting the development of technology. America needs more talented people who have expertise in those areas than any other country. 

The great achievement the America has made today is a result of the effort made by everyone who would like to contribute for this country, regardless of nationality. So attracting more talented people to work and contribute for America is an inner power that keeps the U.S. the most successful country in the world.

Finally, some people worried that the foreigners may affect the opportunity of domestic residents. That point is shortsighted. Because attracting more talented engineers to work in the U.S. for longer time could definitely increase the benefit and value they create for the American economy. Those talented people will exert their professional knowledge and may establish more start-up companies, which would finally help to create more jobs and working opportunities for more American people. 

I think America needs someone who can do the job, not someone who has to do the job. That's why the America will continue to lead the economy in the world.
