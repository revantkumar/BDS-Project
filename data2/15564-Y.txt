I support this proposal because it serves both the interest of the U.S. and the interest of myself. I'm saying this based on my work experiences and my friends' experiences.

I'm a graduate student majoring in computer science at the University of Oregon. My research focuses on applying data reduction techniques on modern supercomputers. After years of training and research, I'm already one of the top researchers in this field. My research outcomes are so important and promising for the upcoming scientific research on supercomputers, that my advisor has already outreached to two prestigious national research institutes (National Center for Atmospheric Research and Sandia National Lab) in an effort to apply my research into their upcoming research projects.

However, I'm an F1 student here in the U.S. Based on my planned graduation time and the 12-month OPT regulation right now, I expect to have barely enough time to work with one of the two institutes, but not both of them. Even though I am willing to contribute to the scientific advance of both institutes, and they indeed consider my work to be promising and would love to keep collaborating, I have to give up one of the two simply because I don't have enough time working in the U.S. The OPT extension of another 24 months certainly improves this situation, and ultimately serves the interest of the U.S. and myself.

Finally, I want to point out that my case is not isolated. I have friends in STEM majors from foreign countries (China, India, Iran, etc.) and many of them share similar experiences. This proposal of expanding OPT provides better opportunities for all of us, and will eventually have a wide and very positive impact on the leading position of the U.S. in STEM fields.
