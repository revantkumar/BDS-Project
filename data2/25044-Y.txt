I support this rule for the following reasons-

1. The OPT STEM extension is a great way to attract the brightest minds from around the world to study at American universities. Very few students would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to come study at American universities if it didn't guarantee at least 2.5 years of practical training at the end. 

2. International students are not stealing American jobs. Most, if not all international US university STEM grads who work here end up being successful in their career. This, in turn, creates a lot more jobs for Americans and internationals alike. If I'm successful and bring a lot of value to my company, it will generate more revenue for the company, and they can use that to grow their organization. Therefore it is a win-win situation for everybody. So this is an important thing that one has to keep in mind as this was primary reason for court over-ruling the previous STEM extension.
