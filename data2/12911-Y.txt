I personally strongly support this policy and just simply cannot understand most of your logic of opposing. If you are being afraid that international students will be detriment for the social security, stop worrying about that. We should worry about the poverty in the US now, as it is the main detriment for homeland security, not well educated international STUDENTS! At least those that I have met, they are hard working and polite. Also, STEM industries are the main drivers of the US GDP. If not provide opportunities for STEM students to serve the industry, what do you want to end up with when STEM industry shrinks, and the States is beaten by other competing countries in the world?
