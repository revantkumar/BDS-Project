Ning Ding I strongly support this rule for the following 2 reasons:

1. The extended OPT duration will attract more International students to come to study in US. As each international student will pay a considerable amount of tuition, as well as living expense, it will boost both national and local economy

2. The extension will attract more talent from all over the world to US high technology companies, which will in turn promote the national economy.
