Hongqiang Liu I support this proposal. Almost all employers who hire STEM students are facing crucial competitions with the companies in other countries. Hiring strong and proper people is the key to success. US citizens or permanent residences already have advantage in competing the job positions in such employers because they have no need for employers' sponsors for immigration status. Therefore, if an employer decides to employ a foreigner, it usually means the latter is a better match for this job.

The success of United States and the people in this country mostly depends on the success of the business in this country. Keeping strong STEM people in this country will finally benefit the economy and create more job opportunities in long term.
