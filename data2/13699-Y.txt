I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I was an international industrial engineering master student from China and is an industrial engineer at full time in Foxconn. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to pursue my studies such as Canada, the Great Britain and Australia. The reason I chose to come to U.S is that, the universities here can not only provide me an excellence sources of knowledge, but also a diverse environment that presents me an opportunity to be able to work with the people who have an open mind, which being said is the OPT and OPT STEM extension program.The OPT and STEM extension program protects the international students with high qualifications against any dissemination when competing with domestic students, under e-verify companies. 

Also, the change from 17 months to 24 months is highly agreed. I already saw many of my friends had to go back to China before completing their projects in the U.S, solely because the 17 months is not enough. A lot of projects are mid-long term, which involves a group of team members, and each of them has an essential role that it is a shame to have any one of them leave because their legal status doesn't let them stay, no matter how talent they are. 

I would greatly appreciate if this rule can be approved, that I can utilize my skills learnt from the U.S university, and have enough time to practice in real life, to make real difference and I will be happy to go back to China eventually and be proud that I have made my right decision to spent one of the most important period of time of my life.
