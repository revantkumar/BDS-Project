I strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for non immigrant students with STEM degrees. This helps students' career enormously. If you look at most of the top tier universities offering masters programs in STEM subjects; most of the graduate students in these universities come from around the world. If they have to go home after graduation there will be a shortage for talented workers in the US. Also, what sense does it make to not use these young minds after spending resources on training them? Many of these students pay out of state tuition, many do not qualify for tuition reimbursements or financial assistance due to their foreign and out of state status. They pay their fair share into the system and in my opinion, don't actively engage in replacing already working Americans. However, I do recommend adding provisions to avoid misuse of the OPT authorizations by employers and making sure that the students are paid adequately based on the market. 

Thanks
