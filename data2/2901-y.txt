Huan Shao I strongly SUPPORT the OPT-extension rule because:

1. OPT program is related to US educational institutions directly. Longer OPT interval is fundamentally a selling point of the US education market. A number of people who come to the US rather than choosing other countries because of this benefit. If the extension was canceled, it would definitely be a financial threat to most US educational institutions---No one would ever like to bring CASH to the country anymore in exchange of education. The extension rule, to some degree, is a basic sales strategy that has worked well. 

2. People should not consider OPT as the general immigration issue. OPT is quite a restrictive rule because it is only granted to those who have studied in a US institution---It is not even immigration. Every year the US allows a lot of illegal immigrants to come to this country for free, whereas qualified people who are anxious to create precious values for the US are forced to give too many restrictions if they want to stay.

3. If students studying in the US all go back to their countries or other more open countries after only 1 years training, soon they will create values for these countries that will one day perform as competitors with the US companies.Therefore, it is wiser to keep these labor force longer as important resources to contribute the US.
