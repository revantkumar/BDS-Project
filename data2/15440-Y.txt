I strongly support this rule.

The U.S is a country of immigrants, and it is American spirit to embrace and treat everyone equally. Foreign graduate STEM students are a part of the U.S and they deserve plenty time to find jobs and practice skills here. 

Also, U.S will benefit a lot from keeping talented foreign STEM students here. They will contribute to U.S economy and society through their skills and knowledge. Remember Nicholas Tesla, Albert Einstein and Von Neumann as examples of how immigrants have contributed to U.S. Please trust the huge benefit foreigners will bring to the U.S, hold the American spirit of embracement firmly and vote for this rule.
