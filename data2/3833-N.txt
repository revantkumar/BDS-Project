To President Obama. We have Americans graduating from our schools every year, and I have personally heard of college graduates not being able to find work in their fields of study. And why, because of all the foreign people we have coming to this country to take the jobs which belong to Americans. One question. Are you the President of Americans, looking out for America and Americans, or are you the president of foreign people looking out just for them? Just sit down and think every year there are Americans graduating and looking for work. Why can't Americans be trained for those jobs?
