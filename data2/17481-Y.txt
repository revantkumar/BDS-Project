I strongly SUPPORT this proposal that extends STEM major students' OPT to 24 months.
First of all, U.S. is the biggest immigration country in the world. The most powerful advantage is that US can take advantage of different talents with different country. What's more, OPT students also have made a great of contributions to the development of America. They push technical development faster, increase more federal tax, to ensure the position of the world's largest country. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.
