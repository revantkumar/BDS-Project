Dru Marquardt I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
