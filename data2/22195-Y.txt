I strongly support this policy!
Many students go to universities in America mainly because they can work in a America for 2~3 years after graduation.Tuition fee is quite high for international students. Universities can earn lots of money and in turn this money can be used for the development of universities. If there is no OPT extension, many students will not go to America to study.It will be a great loss for America schools.
