Originally the purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students tools to help their home countries when they returned, but today it is more often used by foreign students as a opportunity to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.

Also, this program is very costly to American taxpayers. Employers have an added incentive to hiring these foreign students as they don't have to pay the 7.65% for FICA and Medicare, in addition to generally paying them lower wages. Why would we allow Americans to lose employment opportunities in favor of foreigners? This makes absolutely NO sense.
