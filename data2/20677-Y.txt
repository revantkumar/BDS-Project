I strongly second this proposed STEM extension, and hope that it is implemented soon. We may be international students, but we contribute a lot to the US economy. Even as students we work on commercial projects as researchers. International students make up a big part of american universities, paying out-of-state tuition that greatly benefits the economy. If this extension is not implemented, bright international students will either return to their native countries or go elsewhere for higher education which will only diminish America's technological edge over the rest of the world. For all the efforts and resources we put in, it is imperative that this proposed 24 month extension rule be implemented immediately.
