As an international student with PhD degree from UC-Davis, I'm currently working for a biotech company in California using my OPT extension. 
The OPT extension will enable me to better apply my research experience and knowledge from graduate school to my current job for a longer period of time. In the meantime, it will allow me to better prepare my green card petition, since all the recommendation letters and other materials need about 6 months.
