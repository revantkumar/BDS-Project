I strongly support this extension program. Here are the reasons:

1. It greatly helps America continue attracting talents all over the world to the US to study especially in STEM majors instead of driving them to other countries like Canada, China, Austria, England, Singapore and so on. It keeps guarantee America's leading position in scientific research and technology innovation. Those STEM students from all over the world to America either contribute a lot in academic research area or stimulate innovation and development in industrial area for the US.It keeps America's competitiveness in globalization competition in long-term run. 

2. Also more international students to America can stimulate the cultural exchange between their home countries and the US. For a lot of college towns, the coming of international students can be the fresh blood to local economy and civilization. 

3. 12 months opt + 24 months opt extension is very suitable for most high-tech companies and research institute, because most of the research projects and new production development cannot be done in one year. Actually most big projects need 3 to 5 years from the beginning proposal to final publication or product launching. If opt is only for one year, a lot of companies and research institutes will face problems to recruit new suitable candidates and challenges to continue the projects smoothly as planned. But those high-tech companies and big research institutes play a significant role in American's industrial and academical advancement, so the new OPT rule should serve those high-tech companies and research institutes to guarantee their effective progress.
