After reading these comments, I found so many people simply DO NOT read the rule before they making HUGELY WRONG comments. It has been clearly stated in the proposed new rule that foreign students have brought significant contributions to the U.S. For example:

"Research has shown that foreign students who earn a degree and remain in the United States are more likely than native-born workers to engage in activities, such as patenting and the commercialization of patents, that increase U.S. labor productivity. (25) Similarly, other research has found that a one percentage-point increase in immigrant college graduates' population share increases patents per capita by 9 to 18 percent. (26) Research has also shown that foreign-born workers are particularly innovative, especially in research and development, and that they have positive spillover effects on native-born workers. (27) One paper, for example, shows that foreign-born workers patent at twice the rate of U.S.-born workers, and that U.S.-born workers patent at greater rates in areas with more immigration. (28) The quality of the nation's STEM workforce in particular has played a central role in ensuring national prosperity over the last century and helps bolster the nation's economic future. (29) This, in turn, has helped to enhance national security, which is dependent on the nation's ability to maintain a growing and innovative economy. (30) Innovation is crucial for economic growth, which in turn is vital to continued funding for defense and security. (31)"

I strongly support this rule because of its importance to the U.S. economy.
