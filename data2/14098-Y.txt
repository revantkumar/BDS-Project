The STEM OPT extension never places foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market competition or the education competition. A US citizen can find a job whenever he or she is over the minimum legal age to work, while foreign students need to wait until the end of the first academic year and continue their job in US until they win the "lottery" of H1b visa. Your so called "freebies" are never freebies but inequal chances for immigrants, and if you cannot win a battle with such advantages o those people, I suppose you should learn how to be more competitive rather than driving your competitors away in a loser's way.
