Anonymous I am a 70-year old with a Masters degree. I am opposed to expanding possibilities for Visa STEM workers. We have 10,000 of our own STEM workers unemployed. Even a decade ago my nephew, a honors graduate of a good university with degrees in business and computers did not find a job for nine months. I think Visa students are being brought in with the aide of foreign studies faculty from foreign backgrounds for the benefit of their own relatives and relatives of friends. I think universities are bringing them in for the dubious requirement of "diversity" and because they pay higher tuition, I think businesses want the cheap labor. I think the government does an abysmal job of tracking them. I think some graduate and drop out of normal life because they cannot work within the normal culture. I know of some former visa students who were involved in drug crimes and worse. I think many visa students leave taking knowledge and skills that are used against our companies. Importing visa students gives educators an excuse for not upgrading our 8-12 system. Women suffer most from non-citizen employment.
I have found that some of these visa students go on to teach unnecessary Near Eastern Studies classes in universities when more suitable classes should be offered. If the President of the United States is clueless about the Near East, what good does it do to have 1,000 Near East classes across the nation? Have one Near East class for him. I think that once they are here visa students in any discipline have little reason to go back to their countries. They are a menace to the country.
