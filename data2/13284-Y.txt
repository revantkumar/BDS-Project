I strongly support the proposal. US universities and institutes spent huge amount of funding and resources to support many international students (especially in such STEM majors) each year for their education, without reasonable employment policy or opportunity, those highly educated talents (who are educated by US money) would be recruited by other countries.

On the other hand, US high tech companies cannot find enough qualified new college graduates to support the vast demand of expanding and competition in such high-tech driven world. It's ridiculous to give away the top talents (no matter domestic or international) to other countries for free just because of immigration restrictions. 

Remember the US is an immigrate country! Let the companies decide who are the BEST workers for them. With best talents, US high tech industry shall boost, which in turn should drive the economy uphill and make the society better for everyone.
