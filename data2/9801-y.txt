Jack Chen I am the supporter of the OPT extension. 
OPT extension students will make contribution to companies in United States and even more. This country also need good students to promote the economics. If the OPT extension is stopped, many international students will lose jobs, thus cause serious problems to the IT companies in United States. Then it will cause serious problem to United States economics.
