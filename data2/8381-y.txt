This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. STEM graduates are creating more and more jobs for everyone. Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. This suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
