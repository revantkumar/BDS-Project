Tian Tian I'm an international student interned for a horticulture company in project mangement office. I highly agree to extend the length of OPT STEM to 24 months since the length of normal projects in my company is 3-5 years including go-live period. Considering the cap limit of H1B petition, it's extremely hard for us to stay through the project and monitor the progress for what we've done. I also worked with other international students who are in other IT departments. As a whole, we contribute to our company, an American public company, with what we've learned to compete in global market. I deeply believe, that the extended STEM ruling would benefit not only US education systems by attracting more global talents but also US companies by melting different backgrounds and culture varieties.
