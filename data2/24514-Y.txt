I think this is a good move as the current H1 B program is becoming difficult to get through day by day because of the number of applications. This 24 month period will give international students a chance to get exposed to the corporate industry and learn a lot working aside a vast talent pool. This will definitely attract more international students to USA and hence will increase the revenue generated from it.
