I strongly SUPPORT this proposal!

I feel fear that some Americans who cannot find a job blame for international students and government! Isn't it ridiculous? Why not improve themselves instead?

Why does company prefer to hire a foreigner instead of you? Because you are not qualified or not excellent enough!

Don't find any excuses for being unemployed. There are still a lot of smart and hard working Americans working in good companies and get good paid. 

In addition, it is more difficult for foreigners to get a job here even though they have OPT. Language is the biggest challenge for them. For those international students who can speak good English and has professional knowledge are precious talents for our country.

As a citizen, I hope our country stronger and stronger. Thus, please do not drive them out just because of some nuts who blame their unemployment to government.
