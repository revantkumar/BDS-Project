I believe international STEM graduates in OPT is a significant supplementary to employment especially in high-tech field rather than impose competition to American workers.

My experience and observation is that employers certainly prefer American workers. For that, you can look no further than some job advertisements posed by major employers such as GE, IBM, Emerson, Lockheed Martin etc. US. Citizen/Green Card holder is usually a MUST. 
Second, for most job openings, excellent verbal and writing ability is usually among one of the most valued skills, which is normally not the strength for international students on OPT. So I do believe if an employer turn to international graduates, that is when there is shortage of American STEM workers.
