I support the OPT extension proposal.

I just share my personal experience from what I heard and saw.

As I am taking an internship in an international engineering company, our colleagues comes from various nationality, include the native American. We work harmoniously and always generate great idea to solve problems. We learn from each other, get new perspective from different people. 

It is a win-win situation.
