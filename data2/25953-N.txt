What is happening is that you want America busted. You want to make it a 3rd world country. It is pretty sad and depressing that you care about workers from foreign countries when there are so many of your own people out of work. Our college graduates can't get jobs, plus they owe a ton in student loans. This is not right. It is traitorous. Hiring our own people, and paying them the prevailing wage will give them the opportunity to rise up and make something of themselves in this life. Paying such a low wage is just keeping people under your thumb. It sounds like a greedy proposition for you to hire foreign workers and not have to pay the prevailing wage or the taxes that are due. And you don't have enough money? Oh, maybe it's power. Well, good for you, because when nobody can buy your products, hopefully, you will go down, and go down big.
