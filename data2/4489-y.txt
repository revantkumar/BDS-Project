Andy Quig I strongly agree with proposal. In my opinion, U.S. is a open country, it attracts foreign students from all over the world to study here. Why do they come here? Because the students can get training after they graduate. Currently, we have many technical jobs which requires these students. This proposal will save money for technical companies to search for talents to work for them as it can make the students work there for about 3 years instead of 1 year.

All in all, this proposal is a further boost for U.S. economy.
