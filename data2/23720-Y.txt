I support the proposed rule of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. The proposed rule is a rational strategy of fulfilling U.S workforce and boosting the economy.

The proposed rule serves as work authorization for eligible F-1 students after their completion of study at the U.S. Since the states have already invested into the young students, it is such a waste of effort to discontinue work authorization and drive the talent elsewhere trained and educated with U.S. resource. Agencies at both federal and local levels are heavily invested in research and education funding and opposing the proposed rule on the ground of protecting U.S. job market holds little merit. 

The proposed rule is to be applied on STEM major students where they fill the positions U.S. citizens are not able to. While there is competition on every single job posting, STEM students are not competing with U.S. citizens, but helping them in a diverse technology and engineering fields. Simply look at any career fair and one could find that employers generally prefer U.S. person considering all other skills and requirement fulfillments are equal, if not rejecting international students with no exceptions. F-1 Students with STEM degrees are still at a disadvantage on the job market with the current extension rules. 

Therefore I support the proposed rule as it would make good use of the education resources and help forming a more healthy job market.
