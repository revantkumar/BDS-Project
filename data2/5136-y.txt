Hongyan Shuai I strongly support the OPT Extension policy. There are a lot of benefits for the US. Such as culture, technology, economic. It's very obvious. There are always many foreigner employees in the US companies. Most companies in the US are global. They have business with different language countries. Keeping foreigner employees can make their communication more easier, so that less problems occur during the business due to the language and culture difference. Take myself for example, I am working at a global auto supplier company. There are many customers from different countries and there are some employees from different countries. Those foreigner employees are very helpful when we have different product order from non-English language countries. They can exactly understand what do our customers' requirements. So they save a lot of time and money for our companies. My point is that the longer the OPT extension is, the more benefits F-1 students bring to the US.
