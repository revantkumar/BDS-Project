Vinit Bakare Hello I would like to request DHS to increase the STEM OPT period as it will be a good option for the students coming here to study, innovate and implement their knowledge. I feel that the flow should be both way, so that there will be equal or more number of opportunities for the USA to have more brilliant people coming and expanding the research in the STEM fields. It will be beneficial to the society as a whole.
