Srinivasan Rasipuram Hi,

I read through your proposed rule, which is a welcoming sign for international students in the STEM field. Few suggestions as an international student in the STEM field:

1. Can you look into the he number of days that an F-1 student may remain unemployed during the practical training period.

The 90 days unemployment period during the initial period of the post-completion OPT is very stringent, as nowadays it is very difficult to secure employment, unless employment has already been agreed upon before initiation of the post-completion OPT. In addition, it is increasingly difficult for international students to secure jobs and this 90 days unemployment rule makes it very very difficult. Can you abolish the 90 days unemployment rule and revert back to the old rule, (according to the earlier rule, international students got their entire 12 months whether or not they were employed) and abolish even the proposed additional 60 days unemployment period rule. In short, can you abolish any limit on the unemployment period, allowing them to get their entire duration. Typically, international students get jobs but securing sponsorship is difficult. So, abolishing this unemployment period will reduce stress on the students who want to follow the legal and ethical means to secure employment in STEM fields.

2. Can you also abolish the rule requiring international students to work only in their field during the post-completion OPT and extension periods. While I understand and support that students should eventually land jobs ONLY in their respective STEM fields, allowing them to perform any work during this transition/interim period will make them financially stable and make it less burdensome for them and the US economy. You could consider allowing students to work legally anywhere or atleast anywhere in their school.

Hope you will consider these suggestions to make the proposed changes better for both the students and the US government.

Thanks
