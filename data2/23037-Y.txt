You know why US is the most appealing country of studying abroad? Open minded, valuing diversity, encouraging everyone to have and pursue their dreams. I dont know why someone want to push international students out of border. Id ask you, do you still want US to be a country that gathers talented people around the world, or a country that only lives the people whose ancestors lived here two hundred years ago?
