I strongly support this rule with the following reasons.
Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00).
Total Benefit to US Economy Benefit in the range of $ 83600000000 for 5 years
Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in their field of study (Example Solar Energy, Medical Research)
Best practices from employers/industries can be reached to the Universities
Without practical training the education for 3 years will not prove to be beneficial to the students (Ex: mobile- android/iOS development)
Students acquire skills and specialized knowledge in their chosen studies ( Ex: Cancer Research, Stem Cell Research, Nano technology)
In developing countries the OPT is not available and that is why the students come to US.
The curriculum and syllabus of the various Universities are fast changing to changing technologies in STEM
The employers will be getting the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT ( Ex: BIG DATA in IT, Social Networking, Mobile technology) otherwise relying on obsolete technologies
The new rule proposed will help that it will not affect any US based existing employees as they are covered under the provisions of new rule protects their interests
