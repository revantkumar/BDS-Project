Seven years ago, OPT and its extension policy was passed as an "emergency situation" in order to recover the depressed economy ASAP.

There is a word describing this behavior exactly in Chinese, and it is called (guo he chai qiao). I believe that the United States government is not going to practice it, as a government.
