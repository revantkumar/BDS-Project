Douglas Meyer The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program is a detriment to USA tech workers. It especially affects recent college grads. The OPT program allows U.S. companies to hire foreigners who have been workin on a degree for at least nine months, which artificially expands the pool of workers for jobs especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. In addition, the program actually provides incentives to employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it. How about a project to help the American worker for a change, rather than every foreigner that can get across the border? Let's help Americans for a change.
