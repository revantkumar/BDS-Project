I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. We need to keep the best and brightest here, like Sagar, who is brilliant and working a great job -- thus creating MORE jobs in the support economy. It would be a shame to train students in U.S. universities, with U.S. resources, and not let them apply their skills and expertise to OUR economy! Let's be competitive and continue improving these visas!
