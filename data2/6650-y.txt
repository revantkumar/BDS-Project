Erik Grigsby I am a natural born citizen getting a PhD in a STEM field. I believe that the 'STEM Shortage' is mostly a myth-- there are plenty of qualified citizens to fill in demand positions here in the United States. That said, I support allowing STEM training of foreign nationals, and I am secure enough in my skill set to not fear some competition in the job market from foreign citizens that come here to work and advance their own skill set.
