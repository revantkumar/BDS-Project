Carol Ma I really feel STEM extension will highly benefit the country from different aspects. First, people who needs STEM extension are foreigners who contribute a lot in industry as well as academia. It's a huge damage if those people stop what they are doing and leave the country. At the same time, this country needs diversity. We should not cut this path by canceling the STEM extension.

Anyway, I strongly support this proposal!
