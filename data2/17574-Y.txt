That's great news both for the international students and American citizens.
As we all know, Employers hire OPT students only at the circumstance that there's no qualified citizens. This kind statement is posted on the employer website like Intel. Therefore, it is not true when people say extending the OPT will harm citizen or permanent residents. Some people may concern that OPT students are superior to employers for lower salary. It's not true either. Based on the cases I know, two of my friends get salary above 70K which is not low at all. Employer also pays for medicare and the cost for hiring OPT students is the same as citizens. Last but not least,OPT students are contributing to the recovery of US economy. They are actually helping create more jobs for people. Failure to extend the OPT will result in loss of qualified worker and brilliant ideas.
