I strongly SUPPORT the proposal on expanding OPT for students with STEM degrees for the following reasons:

1. There will be no one pay for $50,000 per year tuition coming to study in the U.S in the future if the job markets are not fair and equal. Not to mention the huge amount of money they spent on luxury life in the US.

2. The cancellation of OPT expansion wouldn't be legit for current students who are on expansion policies.

3. If the government cancelled the current OPT expansion holders, which takes a huge proportions in IT, engineering and other high-tech industry, the burst of IT bubble will burst. There will be an immediate need in the industry which can not be satisfied.

Please think and behave like a truly democratic capitalism country.
