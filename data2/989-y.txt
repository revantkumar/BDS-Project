Haven Shi I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The majority of my friends study in U.S. are excellent person specialize in certain fileds, and some of them are better than the people from there homeland. I firmly believe they can contribute to the United States of America. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Students from their homeland always face with difficulties like culture, tradition, transportation habit, living way and so on. Despite of that, they are struggling to combine their knowledge with job ability. Therefore sufficient time is necessary for them to adjust before getting a good job. 

3.Although competition does exist, we all know we will fully use the expanding time to reinforce ourselves, and come across the difficulties and do well at work. In this way, longer time can give us more oppotunity to study skills and apply them to our job.

So please expand OPT, students need time.
