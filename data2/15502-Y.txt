I support this proposal for two main reasons.
First, it is good for our students. As a international student, I want to gain more experience in US. Without practice, knowledge is only knowledge. I can hardly connect it with the real world. So, the working experience is part of the learning process. And in engineering industry, the project usually last more than two years, so the OPT extension is very necessary. In another hand, these engineering companies also need us. In recent years, as the development of these companies, they need more well educated engineers. However, less and less US students choose engineering majors. So, at this time, international students with OPT working opportunity are good supplement.
Second, it is good for US universities, which makes them more attractive and competitive. Not like other countries, US gives student more opportunities to practice what they have learned after graduation. So, they could be experienced before backing to their home country which makes them more competitive. This is the main reason for several of my friends choosing US university rather than European university.
The 24 months extension can lead to a win-win situation. So, it should be approved.
