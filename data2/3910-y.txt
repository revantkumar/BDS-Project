Sunzi Kongzi I strongly support this proposal. 
This is a good opportunity for STEM students to utilize whatever they learned from universities. High-tech companies can benefit from this because there would be eligible candidates to help them expand the business. The most importantly, United States can enjoy these talents and improving the technologies for United States before they return to their home countries.
But I have a few suggestions about this proposal. First one is this proposal put much rigorous duties on companies that some small high-tech companies may not benefit from this proposal.
Also, how should we define "accredited Universities"? Should we use some sort of rankings to choose those eligible universities? Who is responsible for the rankings?
