Steven Johansson I strongly support this proposal. I see many international students are so excellent in their specialties, and they made a big contribution to the US companies, research and other career they are working on. So America benefits a lot from those results and bring the good to the country and people. Talent market also need to be kept open in order to maintain competitive for the country. STEM give a good chance to allow those smart people to stay in the U.S.
