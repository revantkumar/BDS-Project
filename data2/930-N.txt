I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.
This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years, avoid paying payroll taxes, and also not contribute to Social Security that these jobs would normally do.

Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
