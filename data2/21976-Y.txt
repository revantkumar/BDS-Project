Hi,dear US government,
I strongly recommend that the STEM extension to be extended from 17 months to 24 months.
There are 3 major reasons.
1) The big data period is starting and will be lasting for a long time. As we all know, big data period is the next upcoming period which demands huge amount of people with expertise in statistics and engineering. As far as I know, students who are US citizens and major in STEM are far less than the amount demanded by the society. International students with expertise in STEM could satisfy the demand of the society and US doesn't want to miss the big data challenge.
2) Shortening OPT STEM extension doesn't necessarily reduce the amount of immigrants, on the other hand, it could potentially increase the number of people who reside in US illegally. Some international students who couldn't get H1B visa within the two years will try to stay illegally in US and their skills couldn't be utilized as it should be. what a loss!
3) Extension of STEM could attract more valuable and skilled international students. Just like the first reason, US is a great country who needs more skilled labor. Extension of STEM could make the COUNTRY strong.
Thank you!!
