The STEM extension of 24 months will provide great opportunities for students to work in the United states. Moreover, it will give the students a chance to apply for H1B visa three times. Considering the competition for H1B visa (hit rate of around 33%), USCIS must also consider increasing the H1B VISA slots or decrease the intake of US universities to fix the immigration system of this country. Overall, this is a very positive step and I hope many such more positive steps are taken.
