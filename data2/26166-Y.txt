It is wrong to give jobs to foreigners holding F-1 visas when our own citizens have trouble finding adequate jobs to support
their families. As an legal immigrant and naturalized citizen, who worked in the computer technology industry for many years,
I have seen what unfair foreign competition can do to businesses in the United States. We need a system that encourages
our young people to enter critical industries in sufficient numbers to satisfy our labor requirements and also, to encourage 
companies to mentor these young people that commit to their industry; not a system that encourage companies to employ
cheaper foreign labor. 
Disney is a prime example of how far astray this employment policy can run; most of their animators are now foreign nationals 
and they have moved production overseas.
