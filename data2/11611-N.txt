Once again an agency of the Federal Government of which I subsidize considers regulations that totally defy logic in their attempt to use subterfuge to dupe the American people, Please review the dismal figures of the unemployment numbers for recent for graduates of colleges and universities in this country for the past few years and yo u will see their are more than enough young people crying for an opportunity. This is BAD policy and shouldn't even be considered.
