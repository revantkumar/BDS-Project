Robert Kohn I strongly support this new rule for STEM extension! I work with foreign EE and CS students everyday. They really make a great contribution to my company and our country.(My company's mainly business is to offering cloud storage and server services to large hospitals)

So those who go against this rule, maybe you do not know that your relatives and friends' lives are already or will be saved with the help of these STEM students. Do not feel regret when the hospital systems are down and cause lots of loses because you repel these CS and EE engineers by rejecting this law! It will be already too late!
