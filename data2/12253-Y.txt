I strongly agree with the opt extension program. There are a lot of tech companies, universities, and a lot of citizens benefit from international students. 

Big companies like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, etc. hire a lot of international students every year. There are a lot of international students in their opt period, waiting to the the extension to work longer for their companies. Get rid of opt extension could jeopardize the tech companies' stability. 

And as a indirect result, international student who want to come to US to pursue a degree will be less. Because compared with countries like England, pursuing a degree in America costs more money and takes longer time. If it's not for the work experience they can get from opt and opt extension, US higher education make no difference.

As to universities and colleges, most of the graduate students in tech field are not native american students . If the opt extension program is abolished, less international students came to America. There will be few students in tech majors in graduate school in the future, which is not good for the graduate schools.

With international student became less, citizens whom have their house rent to international students will find it hard to rent their house out in the future. Same situation will be with those who make living from international students.
