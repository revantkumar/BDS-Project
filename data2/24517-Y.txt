I strongly support this policy because it will keep the US in a strong position in its international competition, especially in the fields require high science and technological skills and innovation, such as IT, research and development etc. Besides, hard working immigrants are the corner stone of a prosper USA and a great American dream. 

The extension of OPT for STEM graduates will help US companies to be more competitive internationally and create more jobs domestically. If the extension won't pass, a lot of smart and hard working foreigners will leave US and work for the competitors of the US companies. This will be a disaster for US companies and more jobs will be out sourced due to the lack of skilled employees. It will be a disaster for US economy.
