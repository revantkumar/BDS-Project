Shiva Chaithanya Pitla I agree with the proposed STEM OPT extension. Because, it gives an opportunities to the F-1 Students to enhance their career development. Because in countries like India we don't get any entry level jobs for 1 -2 years experience as they dont give value to our Master's program until we have any practical experience or work experience for atleast 3 years, so this regulation will be help us gaining that practical knowledge.,

Also, many F-1 students are doing good at Universities, they get scholarship and advanced educations from U.S, who can be a great resource for U.S development. The extended OPT will allow these students to make contributions to the U.S. society after their graduation.
