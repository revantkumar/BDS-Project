James Sanam As a US Citizen, I support OPT STEM extension to 24 months. Our country is founded by immigrants. For over two hundred years, immigrants have made great contributions to this country. We should continue to hire more talented students in STEM field to increase our global competition. One student return to their own country, they could invent something smart that has advantage of us. Fellows Americans, we should have a big picture in the long run to keep America competitive with keep those talented students stay.
