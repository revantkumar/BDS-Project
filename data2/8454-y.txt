Eric Zhang I strongly support this new rule. First and foremost, the new rule will significantly boost U.S. Economic Growth, and strength the U.S. economic recovery. Especially in the high tech. field, Silicon Valley needs more engineers to create next great companies like Google, Apple etc. Thereby creating more new jobs for american people in return. Talented engineers are the number one factor for U.S. to continue to be a leader in the world. Letting these talented engineer back to their own country would hurt U.S. interest. Otherwise, U.S. might not be a leader in the next round of technique booming.
