I support the proposal with all my heart. 
Theres a reason why the number of foreign PhD students outweighs domestic students, its because they are competent, and they are able to deliver to the table. I mean, come on, if Americans are really upset with foreign students taking their jobs, you should go get a STEM degree and compete with them in the job market. But dont sit and whine about it here and try to destroy their hopes of earning a better future in America. 
All they bring is a little healthy competition to America. When competing for the same position, prefeences will be given to American citizen, this is not a set in stone rule but Ive seen it time and time again. 
And there are a large number of STEM graduates being hired by American companies, we should be happy that they are contributing to the US economy and market.
