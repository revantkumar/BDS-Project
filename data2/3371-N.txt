You would think that the ICEB and the Dept. Of Homeland Security would be using their time and extensive budgets, working
To protect our country from the illegal invaders, that have already taken too many jobs. They should be protecting the tax paying American workers and their jobs, NOT expanding programs to invite more non citizens to take these jobs, by making them Free of taxes and social security. We simply have too much Government too busy doing the wrong things, for our own good. Many of them need to join the ranks of the un-employed and try finding work in the private sector.
