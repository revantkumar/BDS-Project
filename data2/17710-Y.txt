I believe that the OPT should be extended for the following reasons:
1. It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens.
2. For those students awarded with scholarships, their funding probably comes from the U.S. government. If those students end up going back to their home country, it means that no return for the investment of the government made on those students.
3. International students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. 
4. Some comments mentioned that U.S. STEM college students shouldn't have to compete with foreign students. As a matter of fact, U.S. students (or actually students in any country) are competing with students all over the world in nowadays. I believe that a competitive market is always better than a market without competition.
