Michael Brown International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow them to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. Even with more than 13 million Americans unemployed, the manufacturing sector cannot find people with the skills to take nearly 600,000 unfilled jobs, according to a study last fall by the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte.
