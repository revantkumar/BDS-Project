I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 
First of all, OPT is part of the study process for the students. Practical Training can benefit the student to gain more industrial experience and enforce the education quality in U.S.. On the other hand, the student can also contribute to the state, since they already learnt a lot in the state. In historical perspective, a lot of great development in U.S. involved people coming from other countries. I think this is also the reason why U.S. is one of the most developed countries in the world. The diversity of United State is one of its more significant and great features. The new proposal could benefit the diversity of U.S. Finally, the STEM student could enforce the technology part of United State. It definitely will benefit the state.
