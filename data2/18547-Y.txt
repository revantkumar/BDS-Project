The entire higher education system is dependent on the foreign students here, they need thousands of dollars tuition fees from these students to run the institutions. Most of these intuitions won't get a penny from government and not many (none) local kids enroll in STEM in these institutions. 
So foreign students are the best bet. I know it's tough to agree with this and you need written proof or stats which I don't have. It's easy to find yourself, go to you nearest college/university and get the number foreign vs local students enrolled in masters STEM. 
After all this, its shame that these guys get the "cheap labor" title in the end. I don't understand why the country each year would allow more and more foreign students to come here in the first place, why don't they just have quota at least.
