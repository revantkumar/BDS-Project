I am in the favor of the DHSs proposed rule that would expand the OPT program. Our parents invested tens of thousand of dollars for us to pursue the degree, why take away the opportunities from us now? Finding a job is also NOT EASY for us, competition happens everywhere, and its not caused by us. As I experienced, citizens have more opportunities than F-1 student, I was rejected by this reason for several times. Besides, number of H-1 winner every year won't be changed, from citizen's aspect, nothing would be different between opt extension for 17 or 24 month.
