I strongly support the 24 months OPT Extension.

As for the US country, it paid around $150,000 to train me to become a PhD in STEM. I don't yet have the chance to contribute what I have learned in my doctoral training back to US.

As for me, I have expertise in risk management including Financial Crime analytics. I developed a production level machine learning algorithm to help Wells Fargo to fight money laundering. I want to continue to do good to the country without limitation. 

Thanks!
