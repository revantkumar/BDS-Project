Li Xu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the several reasons:

1. Since US university provide good quality education to international student, there is definitely a good reason to make them stay, and make contribution to the US, otherwise they will go to other countries to make contribution, make them grow faster. So why not let US gain the benefit.

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Without competition people will become lazier, because they think they can still live well without working. Also, competition make people become creative, brave, and even clever, and get out of their comfort zones.
