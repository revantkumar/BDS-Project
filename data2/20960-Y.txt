In recent years, skilled immigrants have made great contribution to the United States and created much more jobs and opportunities year over year. These skilled immigrants mostly come from international students. The international students who learned knowledge from the US universities should get support from the US government. Then they can stay long in US and make more contributions to the US. 

In a 24-month period of OPT extension, the skilled students will have more motivation, passion and time to make unbelievable change to the US. Thus, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
