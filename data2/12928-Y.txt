1. OPT extension won't influence US citizens' working opportunity. Looking at any job hunting website, most jobs are only open for US citizen or permanent residents. Most jobs who hiring oversea students are in IT area. Why company would like to pay more to hiring foreign students who will need sponsor in the future? Because They need them. There is still a huge short in native IT workers, US companies need these students.

2. If OPT extension cannot pass, there will be a huge influence on US companies who have many F1 status students. I have many colleges who already work for the company for over 1 year and didn't get H1B last year, without OPT extension, they will lose the second chance, and company will lose many experience employees at the same time.
