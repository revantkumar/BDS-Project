WE are not slicing your pie, we are making your pie larger...Any opposition to this relief is simply shortsighted. 

Most STEM students are fully paid by US government to study here, and why is that? Because there is a great shortage of talents in these area, and these area, which are deeply science and technology involved are the very ones kept US economy growing while Europe is still struggling. By limiting our prospects here after education, you will see a significant decrease of both qualified workers and talented students within a few years. Sure, that will, in short term, boost your own citizens employments in these science and tech industries which have gone much less competitive but soon enough these jobs will disappear and values will vanish. Because all those "alien talents" that you cleverly got rid off went directly to their next best options, aka your competitors, for jobs and they will help your competitors take off and eat up your market shares. And honestly, with your core industries fading and economy going down, who will invest, hold your currency and buy your debts so that you can enjoy your social security benefits... Better ask the Great Britain for how it feels like to retire from the throne of the world.

Seriously, how much more advantages do you want? No matter how much we qualify for a job, the employers will always consider a citizen first due to all the hassles and risks they need to take on for hiring us. And no matter how much we contribute, the managerial positions are almost absolutely out of reach. Still, we make peace of all that, because we do too believe only the most competitive market will make the best of us. So when you use all your legal trickeries abolish the system that make US the US, make sure that your children won't be the ones paying up your debts.
