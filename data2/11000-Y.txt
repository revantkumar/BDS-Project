I strongly agree on improving and expanding Training Opportunities. F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees are continuously contributing to the development of American society especially in the area of high-technology. America wants to keep the top talents, and these students are the ones that can keep innovating and help the society progress. Don't let them go because of visa issues.
