Jeff Wei I strongly SUPPORT the extension of OPT. For market stand point, it provides more students with higher education background, thus increase the overall quality of employees. And for employee stand point, F1 students participation in the market can provide a better competition and raise average wage, which is also good for US citizens.
Moreover, since I learnt that America have reached its lowest unemployment rate, it wouldl be unreasonable for the government to still exclude F1 student from the market.
