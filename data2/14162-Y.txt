Dear Sir and Madam,

I am a graduate student from UCLA and am about to graduate and apply for OPT. I really appreciate this proposal for STEM OPT extension. I can see this proposal's impact in helping students with strong background to be able to also contribute to U.S's development of technology. This is no doubt a win-win solution for both U.S. and international students. I know that U.S. values talented people a lot and students who are able to find a job in STEM area can already prove their talents. Even though we international students may increase pressure for U.S. citizens' job hunting in STEM area. I would rather vision this situation in another aspect: with intensive competitions, companies can filter out more talented candidates, which means better quality employees. This would not only good for companies development in technology but also help lower their costs; Secondly, U.S. citizens already have advantages in culture and language environment, and with a little pressure in job hunting, they can work harder to fight for an opportunities. This is also good for self development. Therefore, in all, there is barely any bad influence on anyone. I really don't understand why so many people are arguing against it.

Thank you
