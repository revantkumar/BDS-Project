zoe J The reason why US is the strongest country in the world is because they have all of the intelligent people all over the world coming here to build United States for US people. It's a win-win policy to allow intelligent people stay in US. They are going to pay tax for US government which is gonna be used for US society. No country in the world would refuse this kind of chance, think about it! if your neighbor offers to rent the harvest season of their orchard to you without asking you to worry about how to deal with growing trees, it's a great deal for you! I support expanding OPT and US government should definitly support it.
