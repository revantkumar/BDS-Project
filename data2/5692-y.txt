Xi Wu This is an excellent proposal. 24 months extension would benefit both the students and the employers of the US. The government will also benefit from this decision.

First of all, OPT Extension makes it possible for more international STEM students to contribute their knowledge and skills here in the US. These intelligent youth can add energy to the related companies, bringing new ideas. Different thoughts from them may lead to revolution in technology.As OPT Extension is especially for STEM, obviously US still needs a lot more STEM talents for the development of science and technology.

Secondly,America live on high-technology. Google, Amazon, Apple... I can list hundreds of the world best high-tech company founded by American people. Those huge companies need more and more STEM student to keep themself running on.
