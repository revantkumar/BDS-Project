sri reddy STEM extension is very important for both International Students and US. With STEM, International Students are not only getting opportunities but also even contributing to a large extent back to this country.If there is no STEM, percentage of F1 students will drop,which means US will loose the income from international student, who come to study, taxes while they use this Opportunity and above all, the contribution they make in US.

People who think , its all about cheap labor, think back. US is actually importing intellectuals from around the world. These intellect brains from the past for example, are doing wonderful job for this Country. If you need proof, find out who are the top executives in Top US companies. Moreover, US being the land of opportunities, will face a great deal of shortage in all the STEM fields if its not extended. If fact, STEM should be extended for more than 2 year looking at the present situation.STEM is a win-win for students who come to US for MS/M.D/PHD's and for US economy.

"STEM is not about cheap labor, its about Intellect labor"
