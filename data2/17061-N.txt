-This new proposed rule by DHS to give opportunities to foreign workers, rather than to American citizens, is unconscionable! 
Please listen to "the people" of America and stop importing more noncitizens to take jobs away from unemployed American 
workers. 
-Approximately 10 million Americans with STEM degrees are not working in their fields of specialty, however many would return 
to their specialtys if the opportunities were enhanced for them.
-The OPT foreign workers would also be taking jobs from graduating Americans, who need those jobs--(most of whom have 
huge student loans to repay).
-Why are American graduates finding a stagnant job market, while there are over 125,000 workers in the OPT programs, and 
over half a million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas?
-Turning F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas is just a sly way of getting around the Congressional limits on H-1b work visas.
-Why are big tech companies like Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard laying off tens of thousands of workers, while the Big-Tech
lobbyists have spent over $1 billion attempting to increase immigration limits?--Something smells rotten here!
-Why are noncitizens eligible for relief in America? Give Americans relief, (not for a change, but as a matter of just policy).
