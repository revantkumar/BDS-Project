It is understood that people opposed to this expansion are concerned of the control of cutting-edge science areas taken away by foreign students, if they are given more chances to stay in US. This fear is, however, lack of supports, because (a) STEM majors are typically not preferred by US students, so this opportunity is given to, instead of being robbed by, foreign students; (b) the most important positions in STEM areas are always, and will always be, filled by US citizens, as such positions always require citizenship and foreign students would not even consider. It is not reasonable to consider F-1 students as immigrants who will take away the dominance in certain important areas from US people, as they are actually filling the not-so-important but yet training-requiring positions in STEM areas. F-1 students are more of being labour force at the middle of the pyramid. The top of the pyramid, where should be and will be filled with US citizens, and the lower layers of the pyramid, where should be and will be used to provide employment to basic American population, are neither even eligible or applicable to F-1 students. F-1 students merely fill in the awkward positions to the perspective of preference of US students. Filling such awkward positions by F-1 students is helpful for US to focus on most important issues, and depriving F-1 students of these positions will result in deceleration of STEM areas of US.
Please keep in mind that, F-1 students are not invading into the job positions like locusts and devouring everything. Instead, they are coming under guidance and control of US authorities, US laws and US market. They are working in positions beneficial to but preferred by US citizens, and the benefit is mutual.
