I fully support the expanding of STEM training opportunities. I think it's beneficial for our American society to be scientifically stronger, and industry more productive, and creative.

First, most of these STEM guys are have graduate degrees, so they are able to be in higer and more important positions in research area or company. These high educated people are more intelligent, thus making more contribution to our society.

Second, by extending this training opportunities, we are more possible to keep the good ones, the excellent ones who can get a H1B visa during this period, however those relatively bad ones who can't get a H1B will left our country anyway. I think by extending this opportunities, we are more able to keep excellent people for our country.
