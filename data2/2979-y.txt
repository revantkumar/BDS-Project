May Shi I strongly support the proposal. 

I heard that one of the main reason for someone who doesn't support this extension is that they feel this policy may jeopardize country's employment rate. But let us calmly think about this problem. 

On the one hand, when a person is hired by one company, it means that this company believes that he/she is capable of making enough contribute to it, and when every company has a better development it will definitely have a beneficial influence on society's progress.

On the other hand, if those local people really worry about that their job are taken by others. I think the best way for them is to spend more time to improve their skills rather than sacrifice US's better future.
