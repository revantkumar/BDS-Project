I am an international student, home stay with an American old gentleman, I asked his opinion on OPT extension. He said, just roll with it. The American students don't want these jobs, and the international students want them. Both take what they want, that is it.

For a long-term benefit, the American companies boost and globalized are based on these right international workers; and the advantages are also related to the American young generations, they have the chance to compete in the global environments at home, which make them more competitive at last.

Of course, innovation and leading techs which are the keys of American companies, are all derived from exchanges among the multi-culture, diversification environments. So it's the goodness to welcome the internationalization, and do the best to support these international students, who have the abilities to find job here.

In a word, I strongly support for OPT extension if the future global companies who have the possibilities to change the whole world and whose headquarters of these companies are in USA.
