I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

At a time when our worker participation is at a 1960s level and very many recent college graduates are living in their parents basement, this is a ridiculous expansion of foreign workers in the USA. I used a similar program to hire an economist in the 1990s, but I could not find an experienced American economist to fill the job I needed filled. It took months and a lot of expense to do and in the end it was a disaster since the Canadian I hired was an alcoholic and got his maximum unemployment insurance at our customer expense. I eventually found an American economist to take the job who is still working there even though I am retired. Please don't flood the STEM market with foreigners who will depress the market for American STEM graduates with government loans to pay off!
