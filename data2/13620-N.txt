"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class."

Our government took an oath to protect and serve American Citizens, not illegals and foreigners. Shame on all of you for putting their welfare above ours. It really seems like our government is working against us and purposefully decimating the middle class.
