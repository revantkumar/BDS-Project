Tejas Dharankar I work as a business analyst at a fortune 500 company. I have a masters in Information systems(from US) and a bachelors in electronics and telecommunications engineering(from India). No one gave me a job because i am cheaper. I was not employed because my company wanted to avoid paying taxes. I was hired based on merit.I went through the exact hiring process that anyone else would along with the the reluctance of hiring a non citizen due to immigration hassles. I worked hard for 16 years from school to engineering college. I worked for two years at an IT firm in India and was having a good job.
I did not decide to come to the US because i was unemployed or did not have a job. I wanted to gain knowledge about the best technologies, I wanted to work with best in the industry and contribute to the field. I worked hard for the GRE and TOEFL exams and got an admit from 9 out of 10 US universities I applied to. international students and not handed out freebies. We come to the US with ambitions and all our lives packed in a couple of suitcases. We leave our families,friends and support systems behind. We start from scratch in a whole new world and all that most of us want to do is strive to contribute to your society. We pay taxes, buy goods and give back to the country that gave us an opportunity to prove our capabilities.
I am sure if there was a US citizen eligible for my job position, I would not have my job.No hiring manager wants to hire international students if they have other options.I strongly support the OPT extension rule as it would give students like me opportunities to acquire experience and benefit US companies with our creative and innovative talent.
