1. Highly educated people should repay the country which gives him the education. That's why OPT is here. With longer time, more students can do this better.
2. Those OPT students are legally paying their tax to federal government and local authority.
3. People with better talent deserved to be better treated. There are lots of manager with high positions in silicon valley. Sandal from Google is from India, and Mark from FB is Jews. If those guys didn't make their contribution to the US, what human's life will be changed? They are actually international students.
