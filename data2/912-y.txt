Zijiang Yang I strongly support OPT STEM extension. United States is an open country combined with elites from all places of the world. Its these foreign elites that support the great economic and scientific standing of USA. If we expel these advanced foreign students, they will go back to serve their own countries, which is a great loss to United States. We should try our best to make them stay in the USA and serve their power to our country.
