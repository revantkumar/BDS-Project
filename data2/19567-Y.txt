I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

You may see that there are lots of international students, however, there are much more students fail to come to study in US because they are not outsatnding enough. International students took great effort to pass all the tests and be chosen by the universities, they learn knowedge from US, so let them make contribution to this country.

While international students learn knowedge from US universities, they also buy things, live and eat here, in other words, they spend money. This propesal will atrract more international students and benifate the economy.
