Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students.

If we failed to expend OPT or even, if possible, cancel it. Then by no doubt USA will become less and less attractive to International student. And this can lead to American academic failure!
