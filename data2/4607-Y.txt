I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1Diversity is very important for the U.S.. Many excellent people are international students and if we have them in, they can make great contributions to us.

2. Students after graduating from American universities should be able to stay here and make some contributions to the U.S.. We have already given them good education.

3. Competition is not a bad thing. They can supplement us in several positions and increase the whole economy of U.S..
