The expanding of OPT is beneficial for F-1 non-immigrant students as well as US. The current length of OPT for STEM students is only 12 months plus extra 17 months. However, for the majority of graduate students, two years working experience is just a start of their careers. Foreign students choose to study in America mainly because they believe American has the optimal education resources, and training opportunities. Working experience is crucial for students to make applications based on what they learned from schools. If OPT period is expanded, students may have enough time to devote themselves in working, therefore gaining more valuable experience and making themselves more competitive. The elongation is also beneficial for US companies. Employees with some working experience are working more efficiently than new employees. If the OPT is still 2 years long, companies need to employ a larger number of new employees every year in order to replace left individuals. Companies also need to provide tons of training programs for new people which are time-consuming and resource-wasting. Expanding the training period can reduce the burden of companies on enrollment and training, as well as improve working efficiency and increase profit. Besides the direct economical benefits to US, the expanding of training opportunities will also make US a more attractive and competitive market, as international workers have the potential to promote international trade between US and their home countries.
