Rose Liu I would like to express my strongest support for this proposal as it helps USA keep the most talented STEM students to benefit the whole science/technology field. USA is founded as an immigration country, and as it attracts the best people from all over the world, it turns to be the greatest and strongest country in the globe. This proposal is truly a deep benefit for the nation's advanced science/technology/engineering.
