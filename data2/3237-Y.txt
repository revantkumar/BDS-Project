I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. I have always believed in God that'All are created equal'. The purpose of the proposed rule is to create such 'Equal' job opportunities for international students. If we have more capable workers, regardless of their nationality, engage in science and technology fields for US, it will definitely create further advancement of the U.S economy which benefits everyone of Americans.

I understand those who object the proposed rule are concerned that US citizens may lose job opportunities, however, I don't think that is the case. Firstly, the majority of companies are offering equal opportunities, taking suitability and capabilities of the job candidates as the criteria of hiring. Secondly, the proposed rule only applies to international students majoring in STEM majors, and OPT extension only take effective when they work in major-relevant industries.
