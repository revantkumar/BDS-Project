Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am an international graduate student at the SUNY Albany. 42% of SUNY graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. I and many of my colleagues will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
I am glad me and my international colleagues are able to gain practical training experience in the US because of OPT and OPT extension is important to be because it is very important for international students like us to apply the knowledge and skills gained from our curriculum in the US.

I am very concerned with the possibility that the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule making process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in providing educational and training opportunities to international students.

Best regards,

Omkar Kulkarni
