Andy Zhang I strongly support this proposal. 
It is because that United States have provided such a good benefit for F-1 students, which makes a lot of foreign students outside of U.S. come to here. This is a strong technical force that boots the development of United States. Moreover, OPT extension brings more talent students. They pay high tuition and make lots of contribution in both educational and industry world.
