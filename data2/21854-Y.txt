I support with this opt extension for STEM Degrees from 17 to 24 months. Because International Students Outpace Americans in STEM Degrees.
According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, international students earned 11.6 percent of all American doctoral degrees conferred during the 2012-2013 academic year. However, at the department level, with international students earning 57 percent of doctoral degrees in engineering; 53 percent of doctoral degrees in computer and information sciences; and 50 percent of doctorates in mathematics and statistics.
So why not let international students contribute more to our IT industries?
