Rakibul Hasan OPT is the most beneficial opportunity not for foreign student, but for America as a whole. By OPT, USA is attracting most talented people on the earth and these people are actively participating to the economic growth of USA. I think OPT should have country-wise quota, otherwise all we see Indian companies are rigging the system to bring more unqualified Indians which is unhealthy for the whole system and negate the purpose of OPT.
