Prateek Jain, Purdue University Shortage of US citizens in STEM fields is very real, and has been documented in multiple news articles like the one that can be found at http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real.
As a grad student at a top-tier university myself, I see that most of the other grad students are internationals. Moreover, international students infuse substantial amounts of money in the US economy.
I am strongly in support of the OPT extension.
