I strongly support this proposal. First of all, the international student came to study in U.S., this proposal would give them a chance to use what they learn in U.S. to contribute and practice their skills in their specific field. Second of all, the diversity, I believe, is very important and basic for United States. By allowing talented and educated STEM students working longer in U.S. is to reinforce the foundation and promote American technical development. Last but not least, like some people said, competition does exist. However, competition is not a bad thing. It could make each person work and study harder, and therefore, make American more competitive in the challenging world.
