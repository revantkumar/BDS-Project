Nina Qian Your assertion is based on a WRONG assumption. Please take a look at OPT extension rule first. Students who are NOT working in STEM related fields are in ILLEGAL status in America. As a result, they should be SENT BACK to their own country if their unemployed days reach the maximum. (New rule proposes with Modification: Provide students granted a 24-month STEM OPT extension with an added 60 days in which they may be unemployed, for an aggregate period of 150 days - in whole 36 months)
