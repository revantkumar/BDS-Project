Erzong Wang As an international student majoring in engineering, I strongly support the STEM OPT extension rule, because it can bring benefits to both STEM international students and the US economy, creating a win-win situation. The US is an immigrant-based country, and the many glory achievements of the US are comprised of indispensable contributions from foreign settlers. On the other hand, allowing ample time for practical training after graduation greatly increases the value of US higher education. This could attract more international students, bringing more funding to these institutes and facilitate research, which in turn benefit the society.
