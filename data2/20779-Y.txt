Regarding to Tracking Number: 1jz-8m3b-khig, I want to say something.

There is no denying that most US citizen were immigrants. Otherwise, giving back this country to Indians. It was immigrants who created the most powerful country in the world. If United States banish new immigrants from now on, I doubt it will be that powerful anymore.

Foreign students come over here and get a good education so they can enrich their own country instead of US. 
Local students won't be aggressive any longer since there is less competition. They are satisfied with staying the most powerful country and overlook the weak Europe lesson.
WAKE UP WASHINGTON.
