I strongly support the approval of this approval.
1. Since schools/companies are recruiting international students, it adds more job opportunities to the country actually, and also promotes the economic development. For example, more communities/restaurants come out to cover the requirements of the international students.
2. The tuitions the international students paid contribute to the schools as well. It also constructs a more multicultural environment, the feature that makes United States the most diverse country in the world. 
3. In the meanwhile, many international students make the decision to come to study in the US because there's a chance to work in the US for a while, so that they're more competitive after they go back to the homeland. If the OPT extension is revoked, US would be less attractive to the international students. Most of my friends would choose other countries, such as Canada, if they can't exercise what they've learned in the US.
