So here's a reasonable but curious parent of an American STEM student! At what point do we draw a line between attracting more foreign talent in the STEM field and offering decent wages to existing STEM workers. Typically, free markets take care of it with the supply and demand factor but with government aided corporate welfare like this, the supply will never end. 

There would be a constant influx of STEM students and H1B workers from India and China. These two countries, no matter how much they grow economy wise, will face difficulty employing everyone of theirs since they contain 40% of the world's population. 

With the administration's move we would now have new foreign students (increased influx every year), students working on OPT in pipeline for a H1B (without the SS and Med taxes as an incentive), zero restriction EADs to all H1B visa spouses (H4s) and also talk about increase in the number of H1Bs (see Rubio's campaign). 

I am willing to train and motivate my son to work harder and be able to compete in the capitalist free market but how much adversity will he have to overcome.
