The American Gov is facing the huge pressure from the big tech company. Losing the STEM EXTENSION will be a disaster for those companies as well as the econ development of US.
The International students are facing the H1B lottery every year. 24 month extension would be a great choice for US to keep the talent students working for US. 
IF the Gov can add more H1B visas for each year to avoid the lottery, the extension will be useless. 
But base on the fact right now, the 24 months extension is the best we can do to keep the talent students.
