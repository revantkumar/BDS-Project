This is great proposal that addresses the essential greatness of United States!

Almost all these students are the most talented in their country before coming to US. Now after training in US, they're the most competitive ones in the world. Having them stay serving the US is what makes United States a great country. 

Some of my colleagues are also immigrants, one of them actually left the country last year because of the expiry of OPT (as far as I know). This is a big loss for our company and a bigger loss for us as friends and colleagues. Why good people have to leave? If we have this proposal passed earlier. We wouldn't have to go through such a suffer.

I still remember when I stepped on Ellis Island in New York, I was so proud to see a great nation with the courage, determination and broad-mindedness that doesn't exist in other nations on the planet, to welcome the most talented people to the country. For over 100 years, this had never changed. Let's keep the good tradition and make the great country stay great!
