I strongly support the move by the government. The industries opt for foreign students willingly because of their performance. Foreign students stay, work harder and survive based on merit. Moves that enable them to stay longer and work should be welcomed. Master's and Doctorate Students who study in the US education system should be considered for direct work visa if the companies are willing to file and have them. The lottery system does not evaluate the credibility & capability of the candidate since it is left up to chance. The lottery system cannot also distinguish between the student brought up by the US education system and any other foreign worker migrating for work to the US. Provisions should be made to make sure Graduate students get work visa as soon as possible which will benefit the industries to plan better.
