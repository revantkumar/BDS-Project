I think it was a great move by the government to consider the request and situation of international students for STEM OPT extension. 

This will benefit the USA by having a return on investment on the funds spend by the Universities to train the students. It will also give a chance to students to explore their skills in the best environment. This will eventually increase the interest of international students to come to USA for their higher education.
