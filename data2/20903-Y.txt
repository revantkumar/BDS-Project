I strongly support the new OPT policy.:

1. OPT policy is a key factor of U.S global competitiveness. The previous OPT policy gives international STEM students 12+17 months to work in US. 29 months looks like a long period, but for most electrical and computer engineering employers, it takes about one to two years to train the employee before employees can do projects individually and contribute to company. Now if we do not extend OPT period or even abandon this policy, the US IT and EE companies will become the largest engineer training facility in the world. China, India, and many other developing countries will be more than happy to have thousands of experienced engineers coming back to their home country. For my own major, 30 experience engineers are enough to develop a good power amplifier solution for cellphones. These engineers will directly speed up the industrial transformation in developing countries.

2. International students have strong wills in purchasing estate and vehicle after they get hired. Over 90% of my international student friends and workmates(including me) bought a new car after they get hired and have strong will to purchase estate after they get working VISA. This ratio is much higher then my native U.S students. In this view, giving international students more opportunities will even promote the prosperity of local business and provide jobs.

In conclusion, international students has been contributing to the prosperity of this county for decades, a good OPT policy is surely very important to maintain this prosperity.
