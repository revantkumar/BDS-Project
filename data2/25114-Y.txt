To whom it may concern,
I fully support the newly proposed STEM-OPT rules. As a PHD student in mechanical engineering, I am currently working at a startup company in the US. Because of the OPT, I am able to work in the US, help my company growing. When I joined the company, there are less than 10 employees. After I joined the company less than a year, now the number is about 30. As the chief engineer in the company, I am one of the reasons keeps the company growing so fast, and creating jobs.

My company sponsored my H1B visa application in 2015, but because the cap of the H1B, I didn't get my working visa. Now my My OPT is about to expired. Without the STEM opt extension, I am not able to legally working in the US. I am forced going back to my mother country, I probably will find a similar job as what I am doing now. But then I am working for the competitors of the US company. 

I am only a simple example shows how the conservative immigration rules keeps talents away from the US. If the talent students, especially the higher educated ones are all leaving the US, it will ultimately hurt the US economy.
