I am a big fan of this proposal because it enable the US companies to stay competitive to other companies from abroad. I am in the field of computer science. Many IT companies in the state are facing the competitions from other IT giants from abroad such as Baidu, Alibaba from China. For these companies such as Facebook, Google etc. to stay competitive, high-quality engineers are the key to success. In fact, a large portion of the engineers are from the international students under STEM. And if they have the opportunity to work without worrying about their legal status in these companies for several years before they get the H1B visa, it is more likely they would join the companies in US instead of joining the competitors in their home country.
