Can Liu I strongly support this proposal.

I've read some comments said international student may take job opportunities from u.s. residents because the wage are much lower for international students. They also said the have young age kids, like 18, who couldn't find job because international students. 

I doubt these people didn't read through the proposal carefully. Because this proposal is for international students who have speciality. They are adults and have at least bachelor degrees. 

Also, the OPT policy make very clear that international students have to find a job equivalent to their level and wage to get their OPT approved. 

Finally, not all companies want to hire international students, because they may need sponsorship at some point. It means extra paper work and cost for the companies. 

Thus, international student are never be threats for young Americans.
