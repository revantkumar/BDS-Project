TO DHS

The United States of America has an abundance of unemployed workers. We don't need to import more workers for tech jobs. It is obvious to me and millions of Americans that mega-corporations and billionaires think they have all the right solutions including a plan to circumvent the limit on H-1B visas; their plan is to expand the Optional Practical Training Program. I say NO! Their attempts to forego American workers and expressing their preference for foreign tech workers is all wrong. These corporate bullies remind me of oligarchic companies and monopolies of the early 20th century when these behemoth entities wanted to control the open market. NO! Our country has over 2 million unemployed residents with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree. There are about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties, many of whom would return to those fields with appropriate incentives. The OPT foreign workers will displace graduating Americans who are struggling to repay massive student loans.
My country is at the cornerstone of death and economic collapse, we do not need more imported workers to take away jobs from Americans. Don't you even care for you country? From all appearances---you don't.
