I'm a international student from China who is working for Vertafore now. I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my work experience at Vertafore, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion. For the benefit of both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents, hope more people support this good rule!
