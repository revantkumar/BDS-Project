Patrick Roberts As a law abiding American with a modicum of common sense, I oppose giving preference to foreign workers and, in effect, stealing from Social Security. Any part of this proposal that undermines American workers or gives employers incentive to hire foreigners over Americans should be stripped out. Also, foreigners should have to pay the same taxes as Americans. Common sense.
