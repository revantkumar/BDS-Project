I do not understand what country Obama is Pres of! He helps everyone but Americans. Obama's way is free stuff give away. 
My question is who pays? The Government has no money. Its resources are from tax and Federal Reserve fiat money. The debt is unsustainable. The government is living beyond its means. Lower wage workers do not pay taxes they are subsidized and even given more free stuff.

Everything this administration does smacks of socialism and making the little people subject to the whims of bad bloated Government. Once the Government tells you what you can and cannot do and what you can make you are a slave.The H-1 people are better off at the expense of the citizen.

A hand out from the Government is like giving yourself a transfusion from the left arm to the right with a hole in the hose.
