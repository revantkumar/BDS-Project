I strongly support this OPT STEM approval.

Please do NOT refer to international STEM students as "cheap labor". I paid high tuition (over $100,000, not including Boston's high living expenses) to get into the Top 1 tech university in the States, MIT, and studied hard day and night (oh yeah I only had 3 hours sleep every day for two years).

I beat all other job applicants, international or American, for the same role in Google, not because I get paid any less than any peer on our team, but because and here I quote my supervisor, one of the interviewers, "your knowledge and the way you think about data structures or algorithms is on a whole new level compared to your peers, and we'd be thrilled if you'd like to join our team". My supervisor is a white American male.

So please kindly let me know WHICH PART OF ME IS CHEAP because I find this word OFFENSIVE--to my intelligence, to my accomplishments and to my pride. 

MY SALARY IS CHEAP? --I earn $200K+ plus bonus a year. 

ME AS A PERSON CHEAP? I worked hard, paid tuition, and used my intelligence to develop software and programs for normal Americans to use and take advantage of. I don't call this cheap.

I only get hired because I'm MORE QUALIFIED than anyone else applying for this position, other stem students, local and international, so does my other fellow international STEM students. If you're not grateful for what we've been contributing to this country, that's fine, BUT AT LEAST BE SANE and GIVE US RESPECT AND OPPORTUNITY WE DESERVE. Thank you.
