Joyce Guckenburger I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. America is an open-minded country and ourselves are immigrants decades ago. We came here to make the America a better place and I believe the foreign students want to come here for the same reason. If not for foreign students, do we really have enough people to do all the STEM work? I think the answer is no and we cannot afford the economic loss because we refuse to extend the OPT for STEM students.
