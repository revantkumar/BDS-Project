STOP giving American jobs to foreigners taking the food out of their mouths. The government's first & primary responsibility is to protect AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THAT MEANS PROTECTING OUR JOBS & LIVELYHOOD! I know of a number of instances where this has happened, most recently with Tech people working for Disney many for 10 years & longer. They brought in foreigners to take their jobs at a lower pay and then forced the employees who were getting the ax to train them. If they refused they lost their severance package. Enough is enough. If our government want to put every nation in the world ahead of America then those people need to go and join one of those nations as they are clearly not 
an AMERICAN.

GOD BLESS AMERICA!
