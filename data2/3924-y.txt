Zhong Ji I think this OPT is beneficial to both international students and the country. In additional to the financial benefit for US colleges, which have been in serious financial stress in recent years, it is especially helpful to to foster and spread the Entrepreneur spirit of the country to the world. For students from USA, to dropout the school to start a company or join a startup is not a problem. But for international students, they don't have the option to dropout and legally stay in US to join a startup. This OPT is very helpful, at least, for them to be legally to be part of a startup team after their graduation for good opportunities. They are one of the good supply of fresh blood for small business, which is the driving engine of the employment and innovation.
