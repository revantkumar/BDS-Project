Yue Lu This is a GOOD and REASONABLE move. It is NOT HURTING anyone. It is NOT GIVING AWAY JOBs to foreigners. Stop international students from working in the States does not equal more jobs for the citizens. If you are not skillful, even if you are a citizen, you still cannot get the job.

The proposal HELPS the society to be a vivid one because skilled international students are trying their best to make contributions to the US economy and develop high tech.

Competitions do exist but it's actually a win-win. A society without competitions is a weak one, even if everyone can have a job. But what's the meaning of that kind of a society? Nobody is improving their skills. 

And international students pay high tuition to go to universities in the US, not only want to gain knowledge, but also they want to gain working experience in the US, if the extension was just one year, it is more like an internship instead of a full-time job. And it prevents the employer to hire international students to some extent. And chances are that fewer and fewer international students will come to the States for their study.
