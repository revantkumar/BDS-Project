I was really inspired by the expanding of OPT at first. I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, and a lot of well-known people were students in U.S. before they became great scientists, engineers, etc.
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. In my opinion, it will be a good way to improve the competitiveness of both Americans and the country all over the world. Competition can help selecting better talent. What's more, most of the international students are not fighting for a job as paid lower than natives. They just looking for the jobs which fit their professionals and they could not find suitable natives for these jobs.
