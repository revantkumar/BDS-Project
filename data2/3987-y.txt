Yiman Li As a Chinese student who is looking towards studying in the US, I would like to point out that this proposal is a win-win for Americans and nonimmigrant students from around the world. It is beneficial for Americans for the following reasons:

1) The American people have always been proud of their nation for its dedication to developments in the STEM field. The expansion of training opportunities for F-1 students would result in increased support from students who excel at this field from outside of the US. This will mean that the thousands of experts working at the frontiers of scientific development will have yet another source for help. Nonimmigrant students are not there to snatch Americans' jobs, no matter how much it seems like it. The truth is, they are there because they are good at what they do. Can a nation reach the top level of scientific expertise without lending help from any other nation? No. The best teams working on the latest technology -the teams that have won Nobel Prizes- are largely international. If a little help from outside can only do good to the scientific developments in the US, why would Americans reject it?

2) The United States of America was founded upon the principle of equality and democracy. That means if nonimmigrant students don't share the same rights that American citizens are enjoying, they should at least have a say and have the right to improve their status in the US. Allowing this would only improve the reputation of the US as a civilized, democratic country.
