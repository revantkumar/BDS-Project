Nitin Yadav I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. OPT and OPT extension is important to me because it helps international students to utilize our STEM degree internationally and gain valuable experience. I also feel that this extension helps in economic development of USA.
