Stephen Wallace International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. International students also help promote a global learning environment. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Many jobs are going unfilled simply for lack of people with the right skill sets.
