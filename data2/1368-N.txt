I am enraged that my government is giving a pass for businesses to hire cheaper foreign labor under fraudulent visa schemes, H-1b, OPT, etc., over native born college grads and citizens. This is certainly not a government for the people, by the people, of the people anymore. It is a corptocracy for the rich, by the rich, of the rich paying off corrupt and stupid government hacks. We are no longer a country of laws. The future is bleak and frightening, ripe for the seeds of revolution.
