I strongly support the new rule. As we all know, we, the America, is built by immigrants more than two hundred years ago. It is immigrants' and their descendants' effort that makes America the strongest, most prosperous country in the world. Living a happy life now, there's no reason we start becoming conservative, and start rejecting other highly skilled, well educated immigrants from coming in and help us build an even greater nation. The new rule is not trying to take American's jobs, but to welcome immigrants to help us build an even stronger economy and generate even more jobs for all the Americans. It's definitely a win-win for both the Americans and the well-educated foreign students.
