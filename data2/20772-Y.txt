I strongly support this rule.

Most of the people with STEM degrees are well-educated people who can contribute a lot to the United States through working here. Each year, many scientific or industrial achievements are actually from the talented foreign people.

Providing more opportunities for foreign people can attract more other excellent people from around the world to come here to study,work and contribute to America's economy.

In history, It is the openness and friendliness to foreign people that strengthens the United States' strong economic position in the world.
