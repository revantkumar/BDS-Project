As one of many students with F-1 visa, I cannot believe there are so many Americans go against this bill! We're here in USA for an opportunity to extend our horizon and enjoy the so called freedom in USA!
We went to universities and learned knowledge so that we can apply it to real practice. And without this 24 months extension, almost none of us will find a job here, and the result of this is enormous to universities, technology companies, and USA itself. Because few people would consider to go abroad and spend a huge amount of money and get the education that nowhere to apply to. And without international students, many universities will lose half of the tuition, the technology company can not find good programmers since no Indians and Chineses are staying.
Many international students are more capable than those Americans who cannot find a job, especially in those hard and time-consuming positions, such as programmers, mechanists and scientists. It is unreasonable to satisfy those people who cannot find a job by not allowing other capable men to work. It is not us who robbed jobs, we were competing with many candidates and once we earned it, the opportunity belongs to us. That's how a company or a country treat workers if they want to go beyond to a higher level.
