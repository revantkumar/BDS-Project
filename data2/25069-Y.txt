I strongly support this proposal by the DHS! As stated by many people previously, our country needs a lot of talented workforce with the required skill set, and not to forget the revenue brought to the country from foreign students studying here. Both are subject to reduce drastically if this proposal is not made into a rule of law. Many people argue that the foreign students allowed to stay here would take the opportunities of the citizens, but that is not entirely true. My view the worthy person gets the position. On the same note, there are millions of vacant tech positions in this country, which have not been filled due to the lack of skilled labor, these positions will remain vacant if the foreign students are not given the extension, and the cap gap relief is not enforced. So i would prefer this proposal gets approved for the greater good.
