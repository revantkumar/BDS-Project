As an American citizen whose father was a tech-immigrant, I highly SUPPORT this new proposal of extending the OPT for STEM students. Based on my experience, I can see a lot of benefits of the OPT extension program and cannot stand these selfish and lazy people suiciding and leading the US to weakness.
The STEM extension give new blood to the US society which is a driven force to both economy and culture. U.S. has a long history of immigration friendly policy which makes the country strong and thriving. The US high level education is attractive because of the OPT program. More international students mean more revenue, consumer and international influence. But now, US is losing these advantages compared with other countries. What is more, OPT and STEM extension help international students utilize their knowledge to gain working experience in industry. These high-level-educated employees contribute a lot to the advancement of the U.S economy. They pay taxes, obey the law and make profits for the company. Some natives believe the cancel of STEM extension will protect native from losing jobs. But they are blind to the truth that it is the high-tech employees that contribute much to the growth of companies which in turn create more jobs opening to natives. The wealth and power of the US come from the immigrant ancestors and their competitiveness. I dont want to see the door is closing!
