I oppose the Optional Practical Training Program on the basis that we have college students of this country paying their tuition by obtaining student loans and racking up huge debts only to find out when they graduate that the careers that they had gone in debt for will now be given first choice to foreign students. I believe that we should give opportunities to foreign students but not at the expense of our own American students. Also if those foreign students who get those jobs are somehow not contributing to the taxing system that all of us honest American citizens have to contribute to, i.e. - I.R.S. (income tax) then I would have to say "FOUL". I do not appreciate having to support other people regardless of where they come from just because there was some law/rule that got passed.
