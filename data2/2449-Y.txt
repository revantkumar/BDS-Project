i would like to say that The Stem OPT extension program will be of a great help to both the students who have gained good amount of knowledge in the fields of artificial intelligence, data engineering and advanced computer technologies. These students are capable of generating on average 2.62 American jobs per a student which is a great boost to American economy and the student's career.

I strongly support the Stem OPT extension program to 24 months.
