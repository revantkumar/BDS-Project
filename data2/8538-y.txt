Yirun Li I strongly support this proposed rule. 

As an international student, I sit with other American students in the same classroom and receive the same education. And I feel deeply for the equal opportunities this country gives to everyone. Promising students deserve more time to practice their skills, with their fellow students.

It is in America's interest to keep talented students for its development. In terms of economy, foreigners no doubt have advantages in promoting globalization considering their foreign backgrounds. Also STEM area is lacking of students with certain skills in STEM area.

It is good for US's education finance income in that more international students would be attracted by longer OPT.
