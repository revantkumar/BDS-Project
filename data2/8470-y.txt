Yanming Chen It's a great program for people who deserve better! If you work hard you'll get a job! Not because you are citizens then you can do what ever you want and still got a job! Also I have to say, if you American come to foreign country, people would love to be friends with you! But why when foriegner come to your country you need to act so mean????? That's not fair! I admire US is a powerful country, people who live in US should have great hearts and make wise choice! Everyone is the same! I don't understand if you are really a hard work and talented, what are you afraid of?? You citizens have already got more chances than foriegner, some firms do not even accept noncitizen. Feel so sick of people who keep saying we citizens in country are less than less:)
