Improving and expanding OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students is necessary and important. US is the lead of the world and is also a diversity country. If we expand the OPT, there will be more and more talents to work for America, which will boost the development of high technology. Foreign students are basically among the top of smart people of their country. Only those who work hard and work best can have that opportunity to US. So with these students, they can offer their skills and knowledge to serve for American people. For example, the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, borned in India who came to US to pursue his master degree. Imagine if he couldn't have the opportunity to work in America, how could he became the CEO of Microsoft. There will be millions students who just like Satya equipped with knowledge and ideas. If we don't expand the OPT, America will lose those talents. It is the tragedy of the whole country! So please expand OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students.
