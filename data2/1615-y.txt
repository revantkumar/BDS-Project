Sandy Taylor I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. 

There are lots of American tech workers who are qualified for jobs but companies like Qualcomm in San Diego continue to hire foreign workers instead of American workers and hire foreign students instead of American students. Please help our American tech workers by not allowing tech companies to hire foreign students. This practice is preventing American workers from getting these jobs. I know people where this has happened. Americans need a chance at these jobs before foreign workers. Don't let this happen has you are causing American workers to not get those jobs.
