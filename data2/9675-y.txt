Jeniffer McLendon I am in support of the OPT extension policy. First of all, STEM international students workforce make American economy prosperous. All of us share the same point that it is the knowledge reserve and advanced technology that make American the world leader. Secondly,universities and high tech companies suffer a lot if they aren't able to attract plenty number of talented people. What's more, in the long term, it is the USA that will suffer from the loss of talented people who just come back to their own countries since they can not stay in the US and make contribution to the development of the USA. To sum up, I strongly agree with the approval of this policy.We should also work out an extension plan for those non-STEM graduates to make them stay in USA as long as possible.

I've noticed that people complain that too many international graduates filled the job market making native American jobless. Hmmmm.... I don't think so.As opt-extension rule has the non-immigration nature,these workers are forced to go back to their country after the extension period. Based on this fact , why not allow them to work for American companies for a longer period before they leave?
