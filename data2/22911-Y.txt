This new regulation can help the economic growth. That's great. If these people can't have the opt extension, they probably will not study in the United States, which will harm the development of high education in the United States. And after they finish their study, these people with high education have to immediately return back to their own country and make the contribution to the economic growth there by taking up the education resources here? That makes on sense. As we all know, human capital is one of the most important input of economic growth. This regulation can not only give people who want to gain some working experience after graduation the chance but also enhance the economic growth in the United States. It is a win-win regulation.
