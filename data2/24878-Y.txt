There is no reason to cancel STEM Extension. Students who are working with OPT Extension are indispensable. They are good at Maths, Computer Science, Engeering etc. which are playing a important role in the field of Science, Financial, business and technology. These international students, including me, are making huge contributions to the US society. Loosing these people means loosing the fuel of all these industries, which can lead to unmeasurable damage and lost.
