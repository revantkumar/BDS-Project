I strongly support the OPT STEM new rule. 
I am an international student from China and finished my Master degree in California. Before I came to US to pursue my degree, I had several good opportunities to continue my study, continuing my study in the university where I got my bachelor degree without any tuition fee or went to UK so I could got Mater degree in one year. My parents prefer me to go to UK or any other countries since my family was able to support me financially without any burden and I could get different experience in a foreign country. But I regard US as the only choice because of the OPT and OPT STEM which allowed me to gain more practical experiences compared with other countries. 
After graduation, I worked for a semi-conductor company using my OPT STEM. In my group, one or two years are the basic time requirements for a project. If I leave next year February,(I am not the only one, all OPT STEM students), it may be a huge loss of US semi-conductor in nowadays and the near future.
US will not be the only choice for newly graduated Chinese university students if OPT STEM was aborted. For foreign parents, they need to pay more for their children to get the degree.
International students didn't grab American's jobs! I spent a hard time to find my first job because of my international status. Students can only find those e-Verify company otherwise we can't maintain our working status and those e-Verify company list is quite limited. Besides it, I was rejected several times because the job require the candidate to be a US citizen.
