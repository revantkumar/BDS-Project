Yiyun Liang I really support this OPT extension because it's a win win for both us and the U.S.
I didn't really know the OPT extension until I came to America 2 years ago. My original plan was to finish my degree here and move to Australia. But since I can start my career here using opt and extension. I think it's really a good way to learn more and to test what I've learned over the two years.
Everything went good until all of suddent the opt extension is cancled, which basicly ruined every plan I had for my future. I was going to work here till I at least become a senior at softerware indistry, but right now there is only half year left for me, after this I'm gonna have more experience than a junior, and don't have enough experience to be a senior. I need at least an extra year to be an actual master at the indistry.
For the U.S. Do u know how much I spend here? Tuition and living spences, at least 10 grand a year. I bet I definitly have some contribution to the U.S. economy.
