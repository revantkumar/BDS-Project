This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both the F-1 non-immigrant students and the U.S. technology companies. Without this rule, the 1-year OPT can only guarantee students to work for U.S. companies for one year. Companies usually spend a few months in training a new employee and have to find a replacement in year. It increase the difficulty of company hiring proper employees and F-1 students finding desirable Jobs. With this new rule, companies can hire an F-1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years which definitely will benefit production. By the way, extending OPT will not jeopardize the employment rate of American. The job of international students is always about engineering and technology, which is most American do not interested.
