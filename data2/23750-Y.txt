I was a F1 Master student majored in Computer Engineering at New York University, and I just graduated May 2015. Now, I am working for a company position as Java Developer. 
Here I want to say how important F1 extension is important for me and for the country.
1. For the country, As I know, there are a lot of student who majored in Computer Science and Engineering from countries like China, and India. After they graduate, they will looking for jobs in the America market, and help American IT company growth. This is a very healthy and win win situation. 
2. Today, only 50% foreign students are lucky enough to get H1 every year. If there is no F1 extension, there will be almost 1/3 students have to go back to their country, and IT company will have a very hard time to solve the problem about lack of developer.
3. For myself. America is a great country. I was attracted by their diversity and freedom. That's why I would like to stay far away from my family and work here. Also, I think that is why America is the biggest country in the world. There are different people from all over the world come here to live and build the country. 
4. There are a lot of top companies in America, that is our dream company. For myself, I hope that one day, I could have the opportunity to work at a company like Google, or Microsoft. Applied my knowledge to create very cool things. I think only in America, I can be very close to my dream.
I really hope that opt extension can be valid again in the future. That will help a lot of foreign students here to realize their dream. And help America has a very healthy and good high tech resource from all over the world.
