I think this rule is of great help to the companies in the tech field area. As far as I know, thousands of tech startups in the US are founded every year, and due to the harsh startup environment, they are in great need of high degree tech people to help them get on the track. And this OPT extension helps a lot since they will finally get those companies into the right track, and who knows if this will create a new facebook or snapchat. I think that will help improve the technology developments and really keep the high degree people, especially international students to stay at US for a proper range of time and make use of their skills.
