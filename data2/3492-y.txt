Tao Wang International students, especially those with high degrees bring the new talent to the country and make the filed more competitive. In the short run it might be true that interests for certain groups of people might be hurt, however, shying away from an ever changing world and turning down talents from all over the globe is gonna hurt America in the long run. I support the new OPT rule and encourage congress to expand the H1B petition limit as well. STEM students are not necessarily staying in America, they want to learn from the best and start businesses in their home country. If business connections and relationship are constructed in their practical learning period, this will bring more business and more work opportunity in our homeland.
