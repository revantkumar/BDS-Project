Kevin Mcnally Good initiative! I support this!

I really don't understand why some people say it will be a detriment to American tech workers. Most international students in my company have at least master's degree and graduated from top tier universities. Some of them are playing very important roles. One of my boss is a smart Chinese guy. He is a principle scientist and he has developed so many products for our company. I respect those who are smart and hard working. These smart people are very important for America. Please don't drive them out. We need them to make contributions to our country. 

Also, I heard they paid a lot of money for tuition. If we drive them out, who will come to send money to our university. You or me? They pay for tuition and taxed. Actually we need them!
