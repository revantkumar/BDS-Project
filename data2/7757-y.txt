Zichen Ma I strongly support this rule for following reasons: 
1. Equal opportunity is a part of American spirit. International students deserve more time to practice their skills after graduation. 
2. Longer OPT time is good for American economy, because many of them will be able to start their business and then hire more people. This will greatly help employment rate. 
3. Longer OPT will attract more international students come to America, thus more consumption will largely spur American economy development.
