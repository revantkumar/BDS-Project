I strongly support the rule!!! Because contest is the motivation of progress! If STEM students are not allowed to work in USA for a relatively long time, and only USA citizens can work here, there is no contest to motivate people to work hard!! Because no matter how badly they done, no one can replace them! So to keep the progress of technology, I support the rule to keep the contest between USA citizens and STEM students!
