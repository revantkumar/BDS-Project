OPT extension policy is beneficial to US.
1. It could contribute to technology development in US. Many smartest international students have great ideas and would like to open a start up. After years of developing, they could also recruit more people. For example, Marvell was founded in 1995 by Sehat Sutardja, his wife Weili Dai, and brother Pantas Sutardja. They are all international students and if we expel them in 1995, there would be no huge progress in storage, communications and consumer semiconductor industry. If they return to their own country, then America would fall behind in semiconductor industry. Because we have OPT and extension policy, those smartest international students come up with good ideas, making birth of new technology revolution in US. Technology industry in US would really benefit from OPT and extension policy. 

2. Companies could select smartest people from the world. With great quality education and good OPT extension policy, America is attracting large amount of best students. After graduation, those excellent foreign students could stay in US and make great contribution to US. They usually work very hard, own necessary skills and could bring more revenue to the company. So why would expel them? From wall street finance to silicon valley technology, those foreign guys, ranging from CEO to new analyst, play an important role in company. They are also the components to make America machine running faster and faster. 

3. If companies benefit from OPT extension policy, they could bring more revenue in global fierce competition. With more and more powerful wealthy companies, US could continue enjoy the prosperity and economic boom today. 

So we shall never abandon the OPT extension policy.
