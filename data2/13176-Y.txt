I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.

Over the past century, the United States has gained a huge step ahead of all other nations in terms of science and technology. The reason behind is that U.S. has more talented scientists and technologists than any other nation. And arguably, a significant proportion of those talents came from international students, particularly from those with STEM degrees. These students chose to serve for U.S rather than other nations because U.S. offer them better opportunities to fulfil their dreams, to make real discoveries or to build a better world. 

If we gave international students, who have proved their talents in the field of science and technology, better opportunities, they will in turn serve this country better.
