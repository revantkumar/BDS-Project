I agree with this regulation. This regulation is not only critical to F-1 students, but also to employers and the whole nation. To students, this regulation will allow them to have more chances to get an H-1B visa. To employers, the regulation will help them keep employees, which will reduce the cost. The regulation is most critical to the U.S., it will help reduce the influence to the economics. Also it will help protect the commitment of the students to the nation. As a result, I hope this regulation will be taken into effect in the near future.
