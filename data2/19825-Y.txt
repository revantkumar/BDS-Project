I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
This proposal has been working for the past few years and it's helping the united states economy getting much better.
The STEM students are making huge value to the country, they came to study in the united states, working hard, it will be a huge loss if they have to go back to their country if they couldn't get the H1B lottery in 1 year.
