I am strongly for this new rule and many thanks to DHS. As for me, I appreciate the opportunity provided by U.S government that can allow me to practice what I learn from the school. The experience is so valuable that can have a huge positive impact on one's life. On the other hand, this new rules also give huge benefits to U.S economy and industry and it helps the U.S to stay competitive among all the other countries in the world. As for me, I am currently pursuing a master degree in computer science at University of Southern California. In our school, viterbi school of engineering, majority of the students are foreigners and it is also the case for faculties and researchers. Thanks to STEM-OPT, people from other places in the world with a smart mind can see themselves practice what they learn in the school and even make huge innovations and contributions to U.S after finishing the school. Anyway, I think 24 months is fairly good amount of time. However, I do think DHS should place a wage requirement for STEM OPT extension, which means to be qualified for opt-ext, wage should be above certain threshold to make sure the company is not exploiting the students. Another reason is that, if the wage is too low, let us say, around 12 dollars per hour, it might imply the student is not practicing his or her knowledge in STEM fields.
