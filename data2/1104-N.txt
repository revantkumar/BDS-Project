WE THE PEOPLE OF THE PEOPLE not WE THE PEOPLE OF THE GOVERNMENT. .... 
With the highest amount of people JOBLESS in this country this administration wants to yet take MORE jobs from the American people. The ONE thing that baffles me is , Why President Obama has not been impeached and most of Congress not been recalled either. Start the Wall on Both ends of the country. Stop Welfare for other countries, fix this country first.... And - GOD BLESS AMERICA.
