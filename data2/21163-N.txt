The Optional Practical Training program allows US employers to hire foreign students for one year or up to 29 months in certain 
fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with training that would benefit them when they returned
home to their own countries. The proposed rule will extend the program to 36 months and would create a bridge to a work visa 
and eventual green card. Further, the program actually encourages employers to hire foreign students because they don't have
to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should service the interests of American
workers, not against it.It is time the United States government starts putting US citizens first before foreigners.
