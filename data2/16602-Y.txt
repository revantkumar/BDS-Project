Agree with improving and expanding OPT for F1 students: 

1. I cannot image what will happen to the high-tech companies without OPT extension. Foreign students are a non-neglected portion of these companies, especially young employees. 

2. I am working as a civil engineer in the field of pipe risk analysis. Many of our projects are governmental long-term projects. A unexpected labor loss would cause other team members overloaded and give a big pressure in processing the projects.
