As an international student, I truly know how much this policy means to us: we can apply what we learn to practice and realize our self-values. But more importantly, this will also contribute to US in many different ways. So it's a win-win situation.

1. Education: with longer OPT duration, a lot more international students will be attracted to America to seek further education. And as we know, the college tuition is a huge amount of money. This will definitely increase education incoming. And a lot of PhD students are sponsored by universities and governments, which means US government will suffer a huge loss if they are kicked out immediately after they graduated.

2. Economy: those international students who can find a job are mostly extremely excellent elites in their fields, because they'll have to be much more outstanding to compete with US citizens. In lots of fields, there are serious shortages of talents and the employers always first consider US citizens. The reason why so many foreigners are working in those fields is they can't find enough Americans to work on it. If employers don't hire international students, these industries will absolutely crash.

3. Progress: as an immigrant nation, America's success relies heavily on the contributions from elites from the whole world. Only with a healthy competing environment, this system will function normally. And also because of this competition, the human being is progressing gradually and our world becomes better and better.
