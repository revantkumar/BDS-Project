I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 

STEM OPT extension to 24 months is beneficial for the development both at economic and technology aspect. 

For the technology aspect, U.S. doesn't want to send all the good students back to their home countries with all the knowledge they learn in U.S.. U.S. spends money cultivating so many international students every year. In 2012-13 academic year, U.S. colleges enrolled about 82,000 international students. And please remember almost all the international students who can come here for school are the best in their class when they were in their home country. They work so hard to be the best here also in U.S.. U.S. doesn't want to sent them back and then lose the first place in the world. U.S. is used to be No.1 and we want to stay like that. 

For the economic aspect, international students pay a lot of tuition fee. That's good for the development of colleges. Also, international students work hard and they are good to accelerate the economic development of U.S.. 

No matter in which aspect to see this proposal, it's a win-win situation to U.S. I don't see why we should send all the good students back to their home country and make U.S. lose so many good resources for the development. 

For the people who talk about the competition of international students in the job market, I urge you to think about why some companies hire international students rather than Americans. If you run your companies, I am sure you want to hire the best ones for your company. If you want to be competitive in the job market, start to work hard and be the best, not to reject some proposal to get a job. 

Therefore, it's wise to pass this proposal. I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.
