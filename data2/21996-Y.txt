I strongly support this proposed rule of expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degree. I think this rule can benefit both U.S workers and U.S higher education. 

The rule states that employers have to pay commensurate compensation similar to those paid to US workers, and make a specific mentoring and training program, with a milestone every 6 months to report to USCIS. These means can make sure that the international students would get a practical STEM experience beyond academic area instead of being a cheap labor to replace U.S workers. 

Also, by offering this extended training program to F1 STEM students, it helps U.S institutions to attract the most talented students from other countries, which makes U.S universities more competitive. Also, when F-1 students finish their on-the-job experience and come back to their home countries, their careers are tightened with U.S more closely, which are indirectly beneficial to U.S economy.
