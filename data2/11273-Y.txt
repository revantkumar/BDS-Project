Unconditionally, as an international STEM major student, I support this newly released rule of up to 24 months extension of OPT. In fact, I believe this extension should be executed automatically for those who already work for US companies when the first 12 months deadline approaches. It is almost known by everybody that STEM majors graduates are needed to push forward of the development of US technology and other related industries. Statistics has shown that majority of international students are studying STEM related majors in US. So I don't see any reason that they should just simply go back to their own countries without any contribution to US economy given they receive precious education in STEM in US. Also, for those companies that already hired many international students through OPT, it would be reasonable to keep those international students for a while longer. Because, as we all know, it is very expensive to recruit right candidates for certain positions not just in money wise but also in time wise. With that being said, it would be a big loss for those companies which have to let go their non-citizen employees. Above all, I believe it would be very beneficial for both US companies and international students to have this extension to make full use of what have learned in US to contribute to the economy development of US.
