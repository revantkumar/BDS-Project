I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S. Otherwise why would international students come here paying expensive tuitions to study? Without that incentive, U.S. higher education will lose attraction to international students. A great drop of international students will be seen soon if such is the case.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. and it's one of the most important factors that make U.S. a strong nation in the world. If we don't allow diversity and encourage talents from all over the globe, U.S. will have a hardship to grow and stay ahead.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. We all know that good competition creates great progress, and also makes the whole society stays healthy and strong.
