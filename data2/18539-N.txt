I'd like better understanding,as to why our once great country,would further its decline by offering unprotected rights,incentives,to foreign workers in this program. I understand the "greed" and or monetary incentives to businesses.Of this I do not approve.What honest American would.How can one even attempt to justify such a blatent violation of "a legal citizens rights",not to mention the obligatory constitutional violations present in such a program.I am very interested in your response and attempts to justify such actions.
