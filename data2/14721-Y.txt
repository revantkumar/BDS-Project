I wholeheartedly support this proposed rule. 
Firstly, a lot of advancements are made when people from not just home, but around the world are given a chance to work in the right environment. This is what has kept USA at the technological forefront. If students come to the US, this country will be the first to reap the benefits when they graduate. The student works for and contributes to the economy. Some might even end up as entrepreneurs, creating more jobs.
This proposal gives hope to foreign students aspiring to make a difference and bring new innovations in technology. Without the extension, most international students would avoid US Institutions for fear of coming back home with a huge education debt which becomes very difficult to pay off due to the disparity of income for the same job function across nations. The few international students that are able to afford the education come back home, and no benefit comes to the US as the talent is lost.
Lastly, Executive Summary section B, point 2, in "Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields" ensures that US citizens are protected from any adverse effects arising out of OPT given to a student. This makes it a well balanced proposal too.
