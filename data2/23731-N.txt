The proposal to give financial incentives to employers to hire foreign workers over American workers is outrageous! It discriminates against Americans! Of course companies would hire the cheaper person--a financial incentive, no FICA taxes or Medicare taxes to pay as well. Giving employers a financial incentive undermines the job opportunities of American workers.
Foreign students plan to come over, learn, and return to their own countries. Encourage them to do that. We need American workers in American jobs first!
