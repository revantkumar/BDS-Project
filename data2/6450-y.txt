Belida Zhang I do support this OPT extension law no matter from the employer's view or from the employee's view. First, this opportunity gives international students who would like to work more time to gain better experience. Additionally, this OPT rule will benefit the the U.S. technology companies as well. Without this rule, the 1-year OPT can only guarantee U.S companies hire students for one year. Based on this, companies will waste a lot of money to train the new employee since they can not make productive result to the company. Last but not least, it is also very good for the U.S education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in U.S. which further benefits the development of U.S.
