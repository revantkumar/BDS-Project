Daniel Ritort I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. First, U.S. employers will benefit from the ability and skills of STEM OPT students, which in return provides more competitiveness for U.S. employers and more opportunities for U.S. citizens. In addition, one year is far too less than the duration of post-graduate research and development projects. Expanding OPT will offer foreign students an opportunity to complete the project to boost their career and make contribution to U.S.
