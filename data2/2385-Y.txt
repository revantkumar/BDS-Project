I strongly support the policy. If the STEM field foreign students are working, they pay tax. That will increase our government tax revenue. Since they are foreigners, not citizens, they don't have the right to enjoy our welfare programs. Isn't it good for us to have more government tax revenue but no government expenditure for them? The tax they pay will make our burden less. If they cannot find a job, they don't have the unemployment benefits from the government. They are much better compared to the unemployed citizens in the U.S., who are not working but enjoying the unemployment benefits.
