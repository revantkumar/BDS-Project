I am a foreigner now working in the U.S.. I strongly support this policy. For all the comments saying that "kick out foreigners so that Americans can have more job opportunities," I really doubt that those people have really thought about whether this statement is reasonable or not. 

First, foreign students did not steal the opportunities from Americans. They compete with Americans starting from the same position, if not worse. An American who has strong capability and talent will not be afraid of foreigners, because he/she knows that he/she can get a job anyway, no matter who is competing with them. Also, even if foreigners do aggravate the competition, it is also good as Americans will be motivated to learn harder, to work harder.

Second, by working here foreign students are making actual contribution to the Nation, which is beneficial to the Nation's development. If the Nation is thriving, there will naturally be more job opportunities. If now all the foreigners are kicked off, I really doubt how the American economy will be, and I would be really sorry that at that time (when American economy declined and foreigners had already been kicked off), there would be no one for those weak people to blame on.
