It is time to change the trend toward increasing foreign worker visas for STEM graduates! We have too many citizens in this country who are capable and trained to fill these positions. We need to focus on filling jobs with unemployed citizens and send the visa holders back to their home countries when they finish their schooling.

I want to impress upon the Bureau the importance of stopping the influx of foreign visa holders who are hurting our citizens by taking jobs from them, primarily because they are willing to work for lower wages/salaries in order to stay in our country. This is a violation of our laws and the intent of the visa programs. It is time to stop this travesty and help our own citizens rather than those of another country!

Thank you,
