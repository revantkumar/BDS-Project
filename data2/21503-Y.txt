I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Diversity is very important to the U.S. and all F-1 students works in the U.S. contributes to the prosperity of the U.S industry too. This proposal will definitely attract more high education foreign student to work in the U.S.. The market related to STEM is huge and there are a lot of start-ups in these areas are seeking eligible people eagerly. F-1 students can fill in the needs in industry and thus facilitate the development of these areas. Competition can be neglected due to the huge market related to STEM, even if there are competition in certain areas it is not a bad thing because companies benefit a lot from competition by getting better workers and acquiring more advanced technologies - it is good for the whole U.S. society.
