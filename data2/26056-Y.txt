The proposed STEM extension will benefit domestic workers as well as foreign students. For international students with degrees in STEM fields, this provides an additional opportunity to improve their skills and be qualified for jobs requiring advanced domain-specific knowledge. Jobs fulfilled by these students will generate direct tax revenue as well as indirect consumption to contribute to the domestic economy. The additional revenue can be reinvested into various STEM training programs (for example, scholarship, paid internship, co-op training) for domestic students and workers, equipping them with the same skill sets to be competitive in the job market.
