When I first got to know about U.S.A was in my history class. I was really fascinated over what made today's America - people's desire to make it a better country. People from all around the world got here not just for better life, but also for contributing their abilities to make it even better. F1 students needs this opportunity to do so. They want to make a difference on their own, but they will need the chance to prove themselves. America need them as well. STEM is what less American students might choose, giving this chance to international students will not just provide workforce but also motivate some of the American students to study STEM majors. I believe this proposal is a win-win situation.
