YOU HAVE GOT TO BE INSANE! The federal government continues its anti-American agenda by providing taxpayer funding, (despite the Obama-caused tripling of the U.S. debt to an unimaginable, unconscienable, ludicrous level), or worse yet borrowing the funding from a country who hates the foundational values of America, to do WHAT!?! Incentivize U.S. employers for hiring foreign granduatespreferrentially and OVER American citizen students! For decades the progressive movement, a.k.a. Communist party, has propagated a subversive anti-American ideology based on failed government programs! "Boooo!" to this yet another treasonous federal boondoggle!
