We are over $18 Trillion in debt and you propose giving financial incentives to employers for hiring foreign students over hiring Americans. With over 90 million americans unemployed, you are denying american students jobs and giving them to foreign students. I understand that you have borrowed over $4 Billion from Social Security and Medicare over the past few years. Foreign students do not even pay into FICA or Medicare, driving us even farther into debt. I also understand that you cannot actually keep track of foreign workers, when they take jobs in the US. 

Let's start taking care of our unemployed students and workers (US citizens) first.
