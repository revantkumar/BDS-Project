I totally cannot agree on your opinion.

Placing foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market competition or the education competition is not bad thing. Competition is everywhere, even other US citizen can take over your job in the future. Rather than complaining about the competition all the days and waste your time, please do consider improving you own skills. Therefore, market competition and education competition do improve the average level of workers and students, which is definitely good for the USA. 

No evidence shows that there are way too many out of work US Citizens AND Veterans right now. Even we would admit that, there also no evidence shows their are capable of high skilled works, especially in STEM, since STEM worker need to learn a lot. However, the companies can make more money, and pay more taxes to the government by hiring more F1 STEM student. The government can take better care of out of work US Citizens AND Veterans. 

You cannot totally blame the Federal Government. Even you are forced to change the employment, you are able to find new high paid job if you were a skilled employee.

All in all, I highly support we should forward OPT extension. We need high skilled F1 students to push USA growth.
