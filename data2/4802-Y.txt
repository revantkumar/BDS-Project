I support STEM OPT extension. The United States is a country of fairness. Elites should have opportunities to make contribution to the society. The fact that F-1 students get hired in some positions instead of native Americans is not result from their statuses. It is because these F-1 students have the skills that our country needs. Those overseas students who can stand out among thousands of candidates indicate they have the abilities that others lack. If STEM OPT extension is stopped. We will be losing numerous talented young workforces and have to fill these high-tech positions with less competitive or even unqualified people, which would be a disaster for US.
