I strongly SUPPORT this rule for the following reasons:
1. It's very good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in the STEM fields. For example, the IT industry and companies in the Silicon Valley would face huge losses if foreign STEM students are not allowed to stay long.
2. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
3. This OPT STEM extension will give F1 students an opportunity to compete equally with American students. Otherwise,US companies would have a more difficult time hiring qualified students.
This rule will greatly benefit the US economy and US companies!
So I strongly SUPPORT it!
