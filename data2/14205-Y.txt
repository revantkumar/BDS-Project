I work as a Research Scientist at a US company in Silicon Valley. As I observed in Silicon Valley, a large portion of the innovations and patents generated by US companies are contributed by F-1 students who work on CPT, OPT or OPT-extension status, or foreigners who used OPT to start their careers in the industry. WIthout them, Silicon Valley would have never became the center of innovation and technology of the whole world and it would be impossible for the world to have search engines, smart phones and electric cars.

In fact, my first and second patents are both coming from the work done during my CPT and OPT time. Three of my academic publications are related to my work during my OPT time. Without the regulation of OPT extension, I would probably go back to China and join one of the research institutes to keep myself engaged to my area of research.

If the OPT-extension visa regulation was cancelled, tens of thousands of talents in various areas of science and technology would have to leave US and go back to their home country. It would be a huge loss for the industry as well as the for advancement of science and technology of United States. Therefore I strongly support the extension of OPT period to 24 months for STEM students.
