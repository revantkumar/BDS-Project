J M I think most international students study hard in school. I am an international student so I know a lot of friends from all over the world. We are just young people who want to chase a life we like as American young people do. I think it's all right to give opportunities to those international students who want to have a chance to work in America. And most of Chinese and Indians work very hard as far as I know.
