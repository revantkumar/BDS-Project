One has to wonder if we normal Americans are ever going to come first with the federal government. 
The OPT program should be abolished, not expanded. There are American citizens being denied jobs just so employers can hire cheaper non-American thieves.
That's right, thieves. They are stealing the future from American citizens who can't find jobs. By having special, preferential treatment, they are stealing from the Social Security trust funds that decent, hard-working American citizens have been paying into for decades. 
AMERICAN CITIZENS are the last in line yet again to be treated fairly by the government. And this has been going on for way too long. All these thieves that you're allowing to stay in America are never going to return to their pathetic life style in their own countries. Why bother, when they can steal jobs in America and live the good life while Americans go without?
OPT stinks. STINKS. STINKS. Every American citizen knows another American citizen who got shafted in favor of a foreigner who took the job an American citizen should have had. Train them then SEND THEM BACK WHERE THEY CAME FROM.
