Karen Lu I support the expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Students with STEM Degrees.

When I first decided to come to America, I was told that the United State is a country that welcomes everyone who has a dream. I do have mine. I mean, look at all those successful leaders of the High-tech companies, many of them are just like us, used to be an international student full of hopes and bold thoughts for the future. If not because of them, who knows where would we learn about the technologies from. Maybe not so many students who expect to learn new stuffs would not come to the Unite State but somewhere else! Not to mention the GDP increment.
Yet now, we are treated as threads of the local folks who think themselves are not competitive as us, and are so afraid that we steal their job opportunities. As a matter of fact, the company who is hiring would have known what kind of person they are expecting for their positions. Even if there are not so many companions, does anyone really thinks they will lower their expectation on the positions that could bring fortune to the company or make progress on the project? If so, I highly doubt the future of the industry. 
So the question becomes quit simple, BE THE BEST. Please do not expect us to leave the country and let you get the jobs. Get them because you really can! And so that you can see we are not threads and we are not stealing the chances. And because of that the United State can have more powerful resources of brilliant people and gain a better future. 
The OPT extension is just one way to see if we really can make contribution here. If we can not, then automatically no one would hire us; while if there are needs of us to work here, then that means we are helpful. Doesn't that make sense? I wish my comment could help with the approval process.

Anyway, this is just my personal opinion. You are welcome to comment or against.
