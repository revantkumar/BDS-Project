I agree with extending OPT for foreign STEM students. It is obvious that hard working and talented foreign STEM engineers have made enormous contribution to US. Americans have benefited a lot from the work that foreign STEM engineers did. As the most developed country, we always need to bring new blood to us and we need to keep the top talents with us. The foreign STEM students are only a small part of the workforce but they are making such a significant impact to our economy! Look at the top high tech companies in our country, none of them will continue to survive without foreign STEM students. If we shortened the OPT program, we will have to lose these hard working engineers. And they will come to their home countries, build their own business, and defeat us with the knowledge acquired from US! Therefore, keep these foreign STEM students working for us! America will survive and thrive with these foreign STEM engineers!
