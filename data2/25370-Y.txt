This change will harm American employees by giving incentives to hire other than American employees.
I work in the STEM field and I have personally witnessed the downsizing of American citizens in favor of hiring foreign 'temps', I call them temps since they can be released without any severance or benefits including unemployment by a employer who just chooses to not extend their visa.
No foreigner should ever take priority over a US Citizen for a job.
The lack of oversight of this program has led to a farce where a job is offered but employees are informed not to apply since the job offer is a 'shadow job' the must be offered prior to requesting a extension of a H1B visa. No applicants are even seriously examined since the job is already filled by a H1B visa holder.
This limit US Citizens who need good jobs.
We have way too many US Citizen students who need a job, no reason to give preferential treatment to foreigners.
