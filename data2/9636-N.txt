As an UN-employed IT worker due to the H1B and L1 visa programs it continues to amaze me that we keep expanding these American Worker Replacement programs. As a father of a Rutgers University college under-employed graduate student I'm amazed that our elected officials continue to decimate the American Worker by flooding the market with cheap foreign labor. 
As father of a soon to be South Carolina University graduate whose jobs prospect seem to be barely minimum wage I'm shocked that our government cowls to to their masters in their thirst of cheap foreign labor. When will enough be enough - don't Americans deserve an opportunity to earn and be self sufficient? When will the government of the people listen to the people. e need our elected officials to watch our back and stop the influx of cheap foreign labor. There most be no more H1B/L1 or OPT. The government for the people must tell big business we have our own top notch students who need jobs, we have our own top-notch workers who need jobs.
