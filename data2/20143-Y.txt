I strongly support this rule, from my point of view, the reasons are as follows:

1. Without OPT extension, the business income created by service agent/company for foreign student will endure tremendous loss for American economies.

2. Most of the job position that OPT applied for are related to those majors that American residence are not willing to study/work in. So in the one hand, to extend OPT will greatly help the American companies (especially IT area) to solve the problem of lacking qualified employees for better development, thus will have positive effect on the overall development for those America companies, in the other hand, there're no issues with loss of jobs for Americans, because for most companies, if there are qualified candidates that have American residence, they will always be given higher priorities. 

3. Competition is NEVER a bad thing. If without OPT extensions, outstanding international student will have the choice to contribute their intelligence and dedication to companies from other countries, in this case, American companies will lose their advantages over others. As a result, American companies need to shrink their scale and size and jobs on demand will reduce, by that time, complaining will bring nothing.
