This is America. American citizens need to be given the opportunity to get jobs before foreign people get them. There is a citizen right to support from our own government, before foreign workers be given an opportunity! 
There is NO WAY employers should be given a reward, an incentive to hire foreign workers BEFORE Americans be given that opportunity, and it should be illegal to do so! In fact, doing so borders on the edge of treason! It should be illegal. We the People are paying the taxes for this government to function. It should be criminal for our government to act against American well being so big business can make more money by hiring foreign workers at less cost, and then be rewarded to do so!
America MUST act in Americans best interest first! Doing other than that should be illegal!
