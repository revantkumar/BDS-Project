I support the extension of OPT stem. OPT international students are not taking over citizens' jobs, instead they are making huge contributions to United States.

OPT stem extension is proposed to meet the job demand in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math area. There is huge demand on these areas but not many citizens are interested in learning these knowledge. Therefore, international students are not taking over American citizen's job. Instead, they are filling the gap between supply and demand in STEM area.

In fact, because of their contribution, many technological enterprises grow up quickly, like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc. Then more job opportunities are created for the citizens. Also more taxes are paid to the government. Again, these technological companies need international OPT students because there are not enough citizens who can and are willing to major in STEM. They would not hire international students if there are already enough citizens who can work on STEM.
