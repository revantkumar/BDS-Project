I strongly agree with the proposed rule. First, this rule will give many international students a good opportunity to gain some practical experience to complement their field of study after graduations. Everybody including locals and foreigners should get a fair chance to gain some piratical experience after studying at Universities here at United States. Second, from cooperation' perspective, they want the best candidates for their positions, no matter to Americans or foreigners, they all have equal opportunities, as long as they work hard and are the most fit person for the jobs, the companies will hire them. There is no such thing as this rule will somehow result all the corporations only give jobs to foreigners and not to the locals. Moreover, pushing foreigners out of job market is not effective way to improve country economics or even get every american a job, because essentially absorbing and letting those excellent foreigners coming into the country to share and work with locals is a really good way to keep improving country itself.
