I strongly support the OPT-extension. As we all know that STEM students contribute a lot to US economy and development. I don't think OPT-extension will give foreign students working preference over US citizens. It is just OPT. If companies want to hire foreign students for permanent jobs, they must sponsor work visa, which will cost a lot of money, so companies will hire foreign students if and only if they cannot find qualified US citizens. Therefore, I strongly agree to give STEM students OPT-extension.
