I strongly support the new OPT Extension Rule. As I am using OPT to work in the State now and I can feel that the new rule is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students. Here are the reasons:
1. I believe with OPT extension rule not only allow foreign students to get more time to gain some work experience, but also let the students to contribute more professional skills to the company. Also bring Diversity to the company at the same time.
2. The new OPT Extension Rule will attract more foreign students to come to U.S for studying, which keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally
