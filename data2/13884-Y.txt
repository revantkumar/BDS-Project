OPT Extension are very important and necessary for STEM students.STEM majors are totally differet from non-STEM majors.
Most STEM-related jobs are developing or researching projects/programs, which usually are years long and require continuous, steady people to complete. It will be very hard to get major-related jobs, if STEM F1-visa students only have one year OPT. It's not fair for them comparing with citizens! More than that, it will be a big trouble for the STEM employers. Usually, STEM-related companys need to spend 2 or 3 months and a lot of money to train new employees. It's not a good deal to hire OPT students, as they can only work a few months after training and leave the US!
