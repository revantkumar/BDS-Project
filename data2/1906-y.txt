Ruoxu Wang I strongly support the rule for the following reasons:

1. Everyone should have equal opportunities to be employed in the U.S.
2. It is beneficial for US economy to have talented foreign people to work in IT area.
3. It is beneficial for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in the US.
