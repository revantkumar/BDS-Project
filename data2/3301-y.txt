Catherine Wang (2nd Comment) I strongly agree with the new rule, as an international student. I graduated from college with a Chemistry degree and certainly, the expanded OPT will bring me benefits by getting me trained with more practical skills. I am not just speaking for myself, this new rule will definitely benefit all the ways in which American can be aware of. First of First, please look through the world-wide university ranks, and think about the attractiveness of those top listed education institutes. Still, US universities are competitive but they are appealing to STEM students mainly because of the STEM OPT benefits. Everyone was taught by the fact that this is an era of talent, and just one extended year can help this country attract more outstanding researchers. 
Besides educational institutes, STEM employee drives high-tech companies to advance and profitable. Without profits, how can a company hire more employee includes US citizen? 

I cannot agree with some of the comments here. Paying for high tuition to support institutes' research, consuming domestic services during the financial crisis, inspiring different cultures and insights - F1 students have contributed so much to this country that I can say, without us, the economy of the entire country will be totally influenced. 

Lastly, again, I firmly support the expanding training opportunities for F-1 STEM Students.
