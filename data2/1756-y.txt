Arlene Luebbe Daily I read of proposals to help foreign students and workers. Why don't I read about programs to help my family members utilize the degrees they worked and paid for? Why should my children and neighbor's children work underpaid jobs that are not in their field of study? 

The financial give and take between the federal government and large companies, "crony capitalism" is detrimental to our country as it lines the pockets of the wealthy.

I work for change in our Congress and Presidency. Democrats and Republicans alike keep choosing their own welfare over the good of US citizens.

Enough !
