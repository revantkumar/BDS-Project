If a company want to hire a employee, the company usually wants to give the employee a reasonable time to work as an intern or 3 months trail period. If you graduate at December and the company hired an OPT student at February, the company has to make a quick decision in 1 month, because the employer has to choose whether to apply for H1B for this employee and submit the application before April 1st. It is too rush for both sides. I heard several cases that the company is very busy and the employee is skillful, but because of he/she can not wait until next April H1B application, OPT expired and the employee was forced to leave United State. Leave the employer a mess situation, sometime to find a good employee will take several months. 
An effective job market is everyone has the option to stay or leave, to hire or fire.
