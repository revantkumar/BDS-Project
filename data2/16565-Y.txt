I do appreciate this rule very much. It will strongly enhance the innovation and the competitiveness of USA in the world.
As we all know, the STEM students, especially the PhD graduates always go ahead of times and contribute a lot to the most advanced technology. While another thing most Americans may neglect is that almost all the STEM PhD students are foreigners. (I am an electrical engineering student in a top University and found only one native American PhD student in our department. As I know, this situation is common in other institutions.) If the OPT extension rule was rejected, a lot of these smart, creative and educated PhD graduates would be forced to go back to the motherland. On one hand, it was a great loss to the USA and very harmful to the creativity of the advanced technology; on the other hand, their back will significantly enhance the technology of their motherlands and compete with America in the future. This has happened between America and China. The unbelievable technology boost in China is contributed by the returning Chinese students who were well educated to get PhD degrees in America. 
Thus, one of the best way to keep the competitiveness of the USA is trying its best to help these foreign STEM students, especially the PhD graduates to stay in America. I believe the STEM OPT extension is a good beginning and hope American government also can do more in H1B visa.
