I strongly SUPPORT this proposal that extends the STEM OPT to 24 months. My reasoning line is as below.
Although some people claim that the international students OPT extension makes them lose jobs, I do not think so. Far from making them lose jobs, the international students created and are creating more and more for the Americans. In US, there are millions of international students, in school or graduated, their consumption increases the GDP of America. For instance, millions of students have to eat, drink, drive and other activities in US, these actions can back millions of peoples jobs. If government cancel the STEM OPT extension, the millions of students have to go back home early.Therefore, millions of American people, who provide the service to the international students, also lose their jobs. These people include supermarkets tellers, the restaurants waiters, the cars sellers, and more. They are our brothers, our sisters, and our children, whose jobs are depend on these international students. 
All in all, I SUPPORT this proposal that extends the STEM OPT to 24months, since they can increase our consumption and GDP, then our jobs also can be created. If cancel it, instead of getting more jobs, we make more and more people lose jobs simultaneously, which effects are far from our initial aspiration.
