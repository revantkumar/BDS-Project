Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule making (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a International Graduate student at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette(ULL) pursuing Masters in computer science . About 75% of ULL graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.

I am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule making process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best regards,

Yashwanth,
University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
