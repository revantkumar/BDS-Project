It's totally unjust. I just found a post doctor position in a research institution and my grant was approved by NIH (Naitional Institut of Health). Generally, to most of normal research fundings, we need a 2-3 years period to finish it at least, but we can not finish one whole project before the students holding F-1 status leaving because of this current 17 months limit. Beyound this, I think this extetion proposal also could be benefit to us to recruit hight qualified international talents from other countries, and keep US STEM on the topest level in the world in the future. I totally agree with this OPT extension proposal.
