Zewen Li Although my status has nothing to do with this act directly, I still support this act. Lots of people are claiming this point without any direct proof, which is non-citizens are push citizens out of work, however, this is not true. As a result, what we are seeing what have changed since 2007 -- lots of more international students came to USA, and among them, with their helping to build a better USA, it has come to the lowest unemployment rate ever this year! I believe this is at least one solid proof that this act will not only protect people in justice, but also the one concerns with correct recognition.
