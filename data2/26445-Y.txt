I am a graduate students majoring in Statistics and I absolutely SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:

1. The federal government is supposed to provide chances to qualified international students who have the ability to make a difference for the United States. Holding a dream, most of international students came into this country trying to gain their degrees. They want to prove the value of themselves by devoting their talents to this country because they believe that the United States is a nation of freedom. 
2. Diversity is the bed stone of the United States. It is also the season that the United State became what she is today. Known as the Melting Pot, this country has a reputation of embracing immigrants throughout her history. Why can a country accept immigrants from all over the world, while it says no to these nonimmigrant students who has high-end technology and science knowledges? It is ridiculous that these F-1 nonimmigrant students got rejected although they have the willing to dedicate themselves, unlike some immigrants who just took advantages of this country. 
3. Competition does exists, but it is in a good way. Most F-1 nonimmigrant students do not intend to compete against the natives. They merely take over the positions that most Americans dont want to do at all. Why would a company pay thousands of dollars to employ an international student instead of a native-born American? It is because the company couldnt find an appropriate American candidate who is willing to do the STEM job. These STEM international students just fill in the empties otherwise the whole system will breakdown. 

In summary, I highly AGREE that the United States to extend the STEM OPT period by 24 months for the sake of the United States and her people.
