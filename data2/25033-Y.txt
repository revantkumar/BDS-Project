I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The students learn a lot form the US universities. They should have the freedom to decide stay or leave US. If they wish to make contribution to US, they should have the opportunities at least.

2. U.S has the diversity, which is very important. Lots of famous people all over the world were U.S international students. If they had a very wonderful experience in US and love US, they can also contribute to US even they are not in US now.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Everywhere needs competitions. Competitions can improve people's potentials. Compititions can make the US economoy more efficient. Students staying here just want to achieve the value of their life. In other words, they can also have a good salary in their own country. But US is the most developed country with the leading in technology, society system and so on. They achieve their life value and US can get contribution from them.
