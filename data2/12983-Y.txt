I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. OPT is just a temporary visa for F-1 students who have graduated and want to work in US, if they can not get H1B visa, they can not stay in US and have to leave. Actually, the OPT extension will not increase the possibility of getting a H1B visa from the enrolling, on the contrary, it can help select higher quality employee. 

2. For the students who use OPT, the company will first consider hiring US citizens, only if they can not find suitable or qualified domestic people, they will consider hiring international students, and this is kind of company is also limited and usually are high-tech company, which make a huge contribution to US economy. 

3. A lot of F-1 students are master or PhD, who are supported to study in US universities. If they can not use OPT to work in US, they will go back to their own country and make contribution to their own country. So, the result is US government support international student to study and doing research, but they will not make any contribution to US just because they do not have the visa to work. 

4. US need high quality but cheap labor, compared to some lazy US citizens, the international students are better choice, they make money, they pay tax and spend money, which will also create job opportunities for US citizens.
