Calvin Friedman I support STEM OPT extension, but also with some suggestions.

Lets see some common problems: Why tech companies are willing to hire foreign talents? Not only because they are talent but they work hard. Think about you went to a foreign country and tried you best to get a high degree in one of those top universities in the world. Then you eventually found a good job. Of course you will work hard to prove your value and try to contribute and learn more because this is one of those most valuable chance you get once in your life! Take some statistic, in 2012, those high tech companies, including Yahoo, eBay, Intel, Google, etc, employed roughly 560,000 workers(as many as 300,000 foreign workers) and generated $63 billion in sales. 

More than 50% of international students in top 50 universities graduate school, which leads more foreign talents with a higher degree into the job market. Those high tech companies are not said hire more international talents more than native talents but because the percentage of foreign talents is higher than native talents.

However, not all foreign talents with OPT work in top tech companies like Google or Microsoft. Some are, in fact, working in some local small tech companies, with a below-average salary rate. This is because the STEM OPT policy is not perfect, it has to improve.

My suggestion would be:
- Set up a clear and high prevailing wage requirement for employers to hire OPT students
- Restrict the OPT program to only certain TOP universities or majors
