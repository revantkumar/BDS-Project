Scott Burns It is all becoming clear now. Unemployment and social security chaos, among many other issues, are being created by our own government. Don't get me wrong, I beleive we should help sub-par foreign countries improve their education, but really? Extending H1-B and H2-B when we have an unstable economy, people out of work, high cost of college degrees, loss of religious freedom, gun control which does nothing but make it easier for criminals, LGBT fighting for a boy who thinks he is a girl being ok to shower in the girls locker rooms, and healthcare costing more than if we simply let it be. Sometimes I can't get my brain around why we let the President and Congress get away with these ideas! Things got to change and it starts with each and everyone of us. Wake up people. Don't be a by-stander and watch America become a third world country. Let our voices be heard and get out and vote. God bless America, we are going to need it!
