The ICEB proposed rule to make it easier for foreign students to take jobs from Americans is so misguided. If American industry would put it's efforts into assisting American students there would be no need for employing foreign students. In fact, I question, why do we entertain these students? Many who disappear into our society and never return to their home country. The sooner we functionalize our system of allowing foreign students in, the more secure our borders will be.
