everett owens I oppose the proposed OPT rule now being advocated by the Obama administration. It is an affront to American citizens who already have to compete with illegal labor due to lax enforcement by the federal government and now this, a rule that puts Americans in a competition with foreign workers. The worst part is creating an un-level playing field that not only puts our workers at a disadvantage it guarantees America gets shortchanged due to the lack of payroll taxes on the positions these foreign workers will obtain. The result is Americans lose again with this despicable administration and its law by regulation not citizen mandate.
