I am against this proposal because the Stem OPT extension is very unfair for international students with non-STEM majors, who are equally qualified for certain jobs. The US education advocates liberal arts education, which attracts a large number of international students. These international students can have the opportunity to explore different academic areas rather than directly study STEM majors. Furthermore, some liberal arts colleges do not offer many STEM majors, which limit international students' choices.
This proposal would largely mitigate the US education's international reputation for being liberal. In addition, certain STEM jobs require communication, qualitative and business skills as well, which are not taught by STEM courses.
