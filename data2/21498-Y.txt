See lots of comments are totally non sense. OPT is an important part for integrating foreign students study in America which keeps American Education system the best of the world rather than a title factory squeezing tuition fees. OPT is important for student trainees and especially for STEM student who requires more time to productive and professional in th field. 

Many are worrying about the job market. But what I want to say is they know nothing about job market. Some tech firms needs significant amount of scientist and engineers which is far beyond the number of expertised citizen STEM students. We need to keep the amount of such expertise to maintain our lead position. Once there are no low-cost trainees to be recruited, we can't hold so many senior engineers. They will soon be hired to our compatitors with more salary and more resouces. Then no one is going to be creative. Firms are fear to extend their business since it is highly cost. Then job market clapsed. So the trainees are not occupying your job not only because most Americans are not experised in STEM but also they will undirectly create more jobs for Americans.

Immigrants make American strong. Open minded to immigrants is always wise.
