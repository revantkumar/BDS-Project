I am very disturbed that the Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. At a time when so many American born citizens are spending vast sums to get the kind of training that would give them the knowledge and skills to qualify for so-called "STEM" jobs this action is unthinkable. My reasons for writing to urge you not to take this action are as follows:

The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.
OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

I hope that you will consider the needs of qualified STEM workers and students in STEM disciplines over the needs of employers to save money an have a large pool of foreign born cheap labor.
