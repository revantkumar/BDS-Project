On first blush this seems to be a good idea. However it is not orking as planed! The foreighn student decides that instead of returning home? it would be better for him or her to remain in the USA. They stay and another USA CITIZEN becomes unemployed and goes on welfare. result of a good? idea gone wrong. Now cost of training and education of foreighn student brings about another USAcitizen increasing our cost of operation. If your are going to train the foreighn student , FORCEthem to return to their own country and NOTbe able to return to the USA. THINK about what you are doing. Please think of USAfirst. I am a WW2 combat veteran. Did Igo wrong to volunteer ???!!!!
