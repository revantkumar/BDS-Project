I support this extension of OPT.

Many have the misunderstanding that OPT students are taking away job opportunities that belongs to U.S. residents. That is completely WRONG. OPT/STEM OPT is for training and serving as a part of university education. Also, U.S. government has imposed many restrictions on STEM OPT students. For example, the total unemployed time during OPT cannot be
longer than 90 days, they can only work for e-verified companies, which is a small portion of the job market, etc. Burdened by these immigration policies, it is already an unfair job hunting game and they have no way to be as competitive in many aspects as an equally good U.S. resident. If a foreign student finally wins a job out from such a competition, that means he/she is outstanding and is the person that this country needs.

If government want to control foreign workers and keep more jobs to local residents. The right thing is to issue a H1B policy change. Revoking STEM OPT will do very little to help.
