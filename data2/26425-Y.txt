I STRONGLY SUPPORT the OPT Extension program for F-1 students with STEM degrees. It is OPT and OPT extension that meet the long term interest of the United States.

United States is great because it is a country of immigration at the first place; the citizen of United States has so far been defined as who recognizes, agrees with the spirit of Constitute and are willing to contribute to the realization of it. Since the most recent 30 years, USA has been the only developed country that not only avoided regression but also has kept a steady pace of growing;this is directly due to stable population growth by attracting immigrants, and attracting the world's most intelligent people to help the country to stay at the top of technology. While the US has the world's best universities, it will be a great loss of US that the graduates will have no chance to prove themselves to the US and contribute to the US economy. Should the US let the top students trained in the top US schools leave the country and let the US hand over the leading position of technology to others? I think the answer here is obvious. Approving OPT extension is the first step to improve the immigration system which is the key to the development of US economy.
