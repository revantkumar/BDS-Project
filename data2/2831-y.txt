Zuzanna Walczak I support the proposed rule. 
OPT is a good way to keep talent employees working for US. So many people concern about US citizens will lose jobs in industries, but without international student works, the citizens could not get the jobs either since there just a few of them study in related majors. In other way, this is a good strategy to reduce number of H1b, 36 months is long enough for international students serve for US. With less H1b and longer term OPT, the government could easily adjust the population of international employees and working opportunities for US citizens.
