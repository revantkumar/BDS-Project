I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule,"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non immigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students". 

First, I would announce that I strongly support this rule. There are several seasons listed at below:

1. In the decades ago, Americans stand up for what is right, fight for moral reason, and never beat their chest, they are men who were revered. So please be acted like them, do not have any political allegiance and religiously think that the foreign students occupied too much job opportunities. 

2. Because this rule only keep that talented foreign students stay, the opposite should know that even there is OPT NOW, looking for a job for the foreign students is still much harder than American citizens. 

3. As an international student, we enjoy the acceptance, and with honor to explore the universe, cure diseases, and develop the whole society together with our colleagues who are most Americans. Thinking about what we bring to this whole beautiful society. 

Therefore, please act like men and aspire to intelligence rather than belittle it.
