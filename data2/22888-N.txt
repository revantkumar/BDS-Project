I am opposed to the Optional Practical Training program. I cannot, in any way of thinking, justify bringing any more foreign 
workers into this country. Our unemployment rate is still high, and this program also lets the "trainees" and their employers skirt
taxes. We have plenty of native born people in this country needing a job; use the training money to help them.
