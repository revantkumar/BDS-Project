This is nothing more than a welfare program for American companies.
Companies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse {H-1B} and OPT to hire cheap foreign
labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software and tech areas.

I can tell you this from personal experience. I am a mechanical engineer with 20 years of service in the USAF where
I was a highly certified expert in acquisition management.

Upon retiring from the USAF I went to work for the Intel corporation. In 2011 when I was within 6 months of eligibility for 
retirement Intel laid me off. At age 59 I was unsuccessful in finding another engineering position despite help from the VA
and NM Workforce. From 2011 to now Intel and many of the companies I applied to have continued to lobby for more 
permits for foreign workers.

Please do not approve the expansion of this grossly misnamed program.
