Hi, respect federal
I am an international student who studing in FL, United States right now for my master degree. I am writing this to highly recommended that you can pass the OPT extension law. As an international student, I really like this beautiful land and the nice people here. We studing hard, working hard and making friends here. Since we are not native speaker, we make more effort to get involved in the new life in United States. We doing so hard. But we are happy here. Some of foreign student in United States did very well in their school stuff in order to get a job then get a chance to stay here. The reason is because these people who want to stay are the people who have ideas and willing to struggle to have better life. Generally these people are full of creative and will working hard. Give a longer OPT is the direct way to help theses kind of people and to obtain their energy. Why the United States would reject a bill which has so much favorable on its own country
