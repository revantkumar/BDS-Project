Bojie Chen Hi, Dear U.S. and U.S. government, please consider my reasons why I strongly support this new rule.

U.S. is the #1 country in the world. Good education is one of the reasons brings more and more students and talented people to this country to get degrees in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) areas and build a better U.S. together with US citizens. 

Longer OPT time means those talented international students have more opportunities to practice their skills and receive additional training. They can contribute to high-tech companies, economy, and the whole society. I am sure the entire nation will benefit from keeping these students, educated in U.S. colleges and universities, rather than sending them out of the country. 

Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. U.S. has so many top companies and these companies needs more people with advanced degrees in STEM. Obviously, U.S. citizens are doing excellent jobs to build a great nations. At the same time, international students provide strong strength as well. International workers don't take away jobs from U.S. citizens, they help to create bigger companies, better economy, which results in more job opportunities for U.S. citizens.

This is a win-win situation. International students can receive more experience and training. They work hard for this country. U.S. economy, society, technology, education, research, and all aspects can be improved to a higher level.
