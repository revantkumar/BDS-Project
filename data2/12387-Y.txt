Being a business major student, I strongly support this rule.
In the perspective of training cost, most big companies spend a lot in the first couple of years in training a well-qualified employee. All the countries have big demands in the talents in the STEM field. It is not wise to lose the intelligent capital only because some people do not want to lose their own job. The market is fair, many jobs need talents to do it; if the supply of those talents is weak, the cost for the U.S firms will inevitably increase. 
The excise of this rule helps U.S maintain its strength in the high-tech field. STEM subjects are hard to study and thus the students who can successfully earn the degrees are valuable. 
I see many good aspects of this rule like reducing the training cost, maintaining the strength in the technology frontier. If I have to judge this rule critically, I'd say it may avoid a small portion of local people getting into their dream firms. However, people should try to achieve their dreams, instead of complaining about losing competitiveness and trying to rely on the unfair rules. This is the way that the losers choose.
