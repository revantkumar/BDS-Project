I strongly support this proposal and here are some points I want to make. 

First of all, being a student myself, this expended period of time allows me to turn what I learned in the class into practical experience and contribute my passion and broad knowledge in a specific field to the company or the organization. 

Secondly, according to my knowledge, I know that students in STEM are still in great demand these days, having this expended OPT allows the company to find more talent students in this area which will result in great contribution to the economy in U.S
