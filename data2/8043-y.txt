Xiyuan Sun, Iowa State Univerity I agree that we should adopt the longer OPT-extention since working in the industry is supposed to be an important component of the higher eduction, especially in STEM fields. Most international students spent a lot (money, talent, energy) for their higher education in USA since they are more confident about the output of USA higher education. It does not really mean that they want to stay in USA for ever but at least they want to have a full taste of the higher education here. Internships or full time jobs would provide the international students more opportunities to utilize what they learned from the university/college. It will make them more qualified staffs or professors when they go back to their own countries.
