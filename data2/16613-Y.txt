Education and employment remain indispensable attributes of an individual and in turn a strong society, irrespective of national status. Particularly, STEM/professional education demands significant investment of time, money and effort. The transition from the title of 'student' to 'employee' has become extremely taxing, given the current job market. The very same scenario adds an extra challenge if you are an international student, requiring employment sponsorship to qualify for a job.

As commented by other people in this forum, companies look for professionals ready to start effectively working from day one. On the other hand, students are willing to groom themselves into young professionals by acquiring the necessary training. Internships/apprenticeships (OPT and CPT) are great ways to bridge the gap between the university and an employer. The proposed F1-OPT STEM amendment by DHS is an extremely laudable step towards positively stabilizing the need-supply balance of student-employer dynamics. This 24-month extension will help companies retain their trained workforce as well as provide ample job experience for the trainees. Needless to say, this proposal content by DHS splendidly emphasizes the benefits of this extension to both students as well as the US companies.

Moreover, E-verify limits the students from pursuing many potential opportunities as many major employers in the market are not E-verified. Also, these companies are not willing to participate just for the sake of international students. I believe there should be an alternative to this process to help the employees and employers and help the students to pursue more potential opportunities

I hope to see this come to fruition soon so that it benefits as many international scholars as possible, majority of whom of which are currently in a limbo as to what happens to their future career options.
