I want to talk about this topic from another perspective. Some American citizens believe that the OPT has offered the international students a chance to work in USA so that they will take over the jobs which should belong to the citizens. That's not true. First of all jobs are meant to be done in an efficient and quality way in order to help others in many different ways. It's beneficial to the whole society. and because of this USA became the greatest country in the world. But the effectiveness and quality of the job doesn't depend on who did the job, citizen or not. The only thing matters is that if you are qualified or not. As long as the standard holds, american citizens shouldn't worry about who did the job. since no matter who did the job, the american citizens will benefit from it. And second, no one will take over your jobs since no jobs belong to anyone, otherwise there is no purpose for people to apply the job. Think about the probability the citizen will get a job will drop if more international students are given the OPT. That's simply a nonsense unless you believe that applying for a job is to draw a lottery. American citizens should be more confident no matter how many people are competing with you. That's the spirit keeps USA prosperous. So instead of shutting down a door for international students, why not be optimistic d and open minded.
