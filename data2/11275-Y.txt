I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. F-1 Nonimmigrant students have been providing great power to the modern American working market and to the economy of the America.

2 The extended training opportunity will promote more and more F-1 student come to the America which not only benefit the USA educational market but also promote the America's industry in the long term.

3 Most company's project is at least 1 year length. If the OPT extension is short, most foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.

4 As a multi-culture country, America should not reject the foreign human resource because this could help improve the competitiveness of the native workers. This society is full of competition and only winner could survive. This is why America is the strongest country in the world. The new OPT policy is really helpful to improve the worker quality in long term.
