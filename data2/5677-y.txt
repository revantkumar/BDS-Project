Sean Vance This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). STEM-related disciplines are responsible for many of the societal innovations that make our world better. International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future.
