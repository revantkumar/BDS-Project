Anand Shenoy STEM is one of the most competitive fields in Education. Students like me from India thrive in the midst of all the shortcomings and opt for a course which qualifies under a STEM degree here to compete with the best. The same students want to achieve more than just a job in the United States of America. They are here in this land of opportunity to learn how technology has affected people and take those learnings back home. But the Immigration policies that were recently affected due to the court order, are now hindering the growth of such students and their ideas. It will be very hard for students to perform to their best when they have to think about things like H1B lottery, OPT STEM Extension End Dates, unwarned court order affecting immigration policies etc. 

The 24 month proposal is a fair rule for extending OPT STEM Period to 24 months from 17 months. I would be pleased if they also made it to 3 years just because of the fact that I have personally seen people not getting picked in the lottery for 3 times now. Moreover people who go into the lottery had 1 in 4 chances this year to get through. 

There are people who believe this will affect jobs for all the locals, tax payers wouldn't be doing justice etc.For this they should know that immigration has always brought overall development in a nations progress. The progress although is slow due to cultural differences and adjustments that a nation does to newer trends but progress has been a constant.
