I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. The reason I came to U.S. to study is because of its 1-year OPT and 17 month STEM extension. With this three years working experience I can learn more and at the time when I go back to my own country, my U.S. work experience will help me a lot in finding good jobs. It does not make sense to cancel the 17 months STEM extension because that's the reason why I'm here, otherwise, why don't I go to U.K., Canada, or Australia? As I'm an engineering student, the industrial area I devote into can flourish the U.S economy, create new job opportunities and change the world. In all, I think this new 24 months STEM extension can benefit not only our foreign students but also the U.S. economy, education and cultural.
