Wenhan Tang US employers need foreign stem students, I support this proposal.

1. It actually cost more for US employers to hire foreign students:
foreign student with F1 opt status can only work for 12 month without stem extension, and less than half of them can get H1B visa before 12 month period ends. Thus, for more than half of the US employers will need to spend money and time trying to find another candidate and spend more money training the candidate. It is more costly and risky for US employers to hire F1 students. 

2. There are not enough capable US citizen college graduate (especially stem major) for US employers to hire:
As we mentioned above, it is more costly and risky for US employers to hire F1 student. But why US employers are still hiring F1 student? That is simply because they can not find suitable candidate who are US citizen. They need suitable F1 student (especially stem major) to fill the gap. 

3. Canceling STEM extension will hurt US economy:
According to USNews (http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2015/09/09/court-ruling-homeland-security-misstep-imperils-50-000-stem-workers), there will be about 50000 foreign stem major students affected. Most of these 50000 stem f1 students work at high tech companies like apple, google, amazon, etc. They are at very important value and position to their employers. Imaging all these foreign students have to leave at once, their employing company would definitely hurt in many ways. Since these companies are usually the leader of the industry, if these companies cannot operate or produce normally, their vendors and contractors will also be affected. The whole industry would be affected.

I believe that F1 students would not compete with US citizen workers unfairly; us employers need F1 students (especially stem major); F1 students are supporting US economy.In conclusion, I support this proposal.
