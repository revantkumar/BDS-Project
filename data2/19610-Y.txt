This new rule is good for US economy. If we only hire American workers, we would violate the spirit of American dream. Everyone deserves their right to compete with others. More competition, more talented workers would be hired and better economy we would have. If we all are narrow-minded to hire Americans, how could we keep attracting talents from all over the world? If we don't have those talents, they would be better utilized by our enemies, like China, Russia. It's time for us Americans to discard our prejudice and work hard together to make a better world. Hail to this rule, and a better America!
