John Lee Extension on OPT? Why not!! The spirit of this country is to encourage contribution from people coming from all over the world. I think those who oppose this proposal are mostly concerning that this new proposal would deprive the job opportunities of US citizens. HOWEVER, competition is a good thing!! Isn't it? With the pressure of competition, the industry would have more productivity, which consequently boom the economy. This will in turn create more job opportunity.This finally makes a VIRTUOUS CYCLE!
