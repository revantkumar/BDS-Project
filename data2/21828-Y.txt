I would like to point out the problems of these negative comments on OPT extension:
1.Foreign Students take away jobs and don't pay tax: 
First, foreign students do OPT with paying tax. And what's more is that they help to boost the economic development, benefit the academic research to the US universities and research institutions. It would be a greater loss to the States than to the students themselves. 

2.Invest in US students more instead of foreign students: 
there is no guarantee how long it will take and how much it will cost to train all US students to fully compensate loss of foreign students.

3.Enough US students in STEM: 
There are really a lot of US students, but the question is the number does not mean the quality. There are also a big number of foreign students in STEM but only a few of them are able to pass the interviews and finally get the job and work in US.
