The extension is completely necessary. It will undoubtedly benefit the US economy. A lot of people are worried about that the international students will steal their jobs by sell themselves short. But obviously thats not true. The whole proposed rules make it costly and burdensome to hire an international student instead of a US citizen. No company will hire an international student if they can find a same skillful American or even a little less skillful American (if the benefit of hiring the international student is not worth the extra cost).
