Actually, we American really benefit a lot from international students. The whole country has achieved a lot of education revenues which can be used to improve our life. We still can find jobs and it is much easier to get promoted than international students because I heard there was a ceiling roof in promotion. Also, what international students do are technical jobs. We America need such talents. We can in a high position and lead them in a company. They work hard, diligent and smart. Those are people employers like most. 

If the extension is cancelled, the whole country's economy will lag behind because these talents are forced to leave America. Instead, they will go back to their own countries and make contributions. What they bring back is our advanced techniques. This will impose a bad impact on America. 

I agree with the OPT extension without any hesitation.
