Dear Officer,

I am an international student, currently working at a financial institution with my OPT. 
I am involved in the bank stress testing project at my company, I learned a lot! 

I am benefited a lot from the OPT program, and I strongly support this proposal. 

I know that, almost all the Banks are lack of employees to with quantitative background in the risk department. I believe the OPT extension will help to meet the requirements of these employers. In the real case, many of my colleagues are using their OPT. 

In addition, I have to say, the OPT program was the thing originally attracted me came to the US instead of UK or other western countries. I am sure this will be an important consideration for all the international students. I believe this new OPT extension program will help to attract more students from other countries. 

It is a great proposal for all aspects.

Thanks,
Caitlin
