Alicia Zhuang OPT extension is really beneficial to the United States. So many well skilled international students will continue to study here and work in IT/ Science/ Engineering field to support US economy. If the government stop providing this bonus, United States will no longer be the dream country for international students. They are well educated, I think no country/Region is supposed to say no to this group: unless the US government cannot do anything about control the number of illegal immigrants. If the only tool to comfort US citizens about the immigrants increasement is to control the number of international students, their originated countries will be so happy that they don't have to loss so many elites every year.
