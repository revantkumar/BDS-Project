Priscilla Ciccariello I believe that the ICEB proposed rule on improving and expanding training Opportunitites for R-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees and capgap relief for all eligible F-1 Students. I believe that education and the work in providing education to all students, both immigrant and U.S. students is important for the U.S. to invest in. We are providing an opportunity for the next generation both in the U.S. and those who come as visitors. The opportunity for American students to meet and study with immigrant students is vitally important to all. The opportunity to meet and mix with students from other countries is a lesson in itself, and provides experience in meeting those who speak different languages and have different cultures.
