I'm fully sustain 24 months extension of OPT. It is not for immigration. For foreign students, they can get more training opportunities. For companys, they can get labor they want. If there is no extension. One year OPT session is not enough for F-1 students to practice what they have learned in university. For companys, they also would not like to to many employees personal alternation situations happen per year. If there is no extension, employments situation would be really serious.
