It's important to maintain OPT period longer than 24 months. My student is going to apply for medical physics residency programs, typically in 24 or 36 training time. The proposed OPT plan is good for him with because he doesn't need to worry about his visa.
He is an excellent student, and i don't want him miss some of the prestigious training programs because of working permission problem.
