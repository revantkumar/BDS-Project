Xueli Zheng This is a good step for government. With the extended OPT, talented STEM foreign graduates will have more opportunities to get good training without worrying about immigration status. Also, I don't think this policy is turning against American workers. There is a high demand of STEM students, and the high requirement of STEM means employees will be evaluated based on their talent rather than origin. United States prides itself for being the most diverse country. I completely support this decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months.
