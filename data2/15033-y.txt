Neal Wong I strongly support this STEM extension based on these reasons:
1. People all over the world come to study in U.S. is because not only it's outstanding education or new technologies but also the government offer opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students to work here. Education organizations' duties are giving students knowledge, the sense of mission of dedicating themselves to making a better world. However without practice, students can't translate knowledge to skills, can't make contribution to company, to society which fails the expectations of education.STEM extension provide more opportunities for international students to hone their skills, to make contribution to company, more profits, more GDP, more tax.
2. STEM extension will benefit both the F-1 non-immigrant students and the U.S. high tech companies. Training that lasts month is common for high tech companies, when they hire new employee. However, 1-year OPT can only guarantee students to work for U.S. companies for a few months which is not beneficial for those companies. With this new policy those new employees could do 3 times longer than without it. A big good news to U.S. tech companies, which could make more profits and more contributions to society.
3. F-1 non-immigrant students don't block development of U.S. on the contrary they help a lot. Companies would like to hire talented people, F-1 or not has nothing to do with talent. With this new policy more talented international students could get hired, which not only help the company but also raise the tech level of the industries. High level means high qualities, means quality-guaranteed. People all over the world love high quality products.
