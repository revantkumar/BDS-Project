I strongly support this new OPT policy. This is absolutely win-win strategy for the US and the international students. The stem OPT extension gives international students an opportunity to further develop their academic and professional skills in the practical training. International students doing OPT helps the development of technology and economy for US as well. One thing I want to point out is that F-1 students with OPT STEM extension won't bring any trouble to the employment of US citizens, because the fields they work in have long been understaffed and need more qualified employees with or without the F-1 students joining the job market.
