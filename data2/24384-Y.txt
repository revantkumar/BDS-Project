I strongly support this proposal because it will benefit this county.

1. This proposal will tell world that U.S. is a country that respects people and appreciates their efforts, wherever they are coming from. Both U.S. citizens and foreigners, if capable, have the equal opportunity for the same job. Nobody can steal others in this country.

2. Most of the international students come to U.S. to pursue higher level degree. This means they already have very good educational and even good professional background. They are ready to contribute their knowledge and experience. Why don't give them opportunity?
