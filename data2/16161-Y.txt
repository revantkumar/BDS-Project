Extending the training opportunities for STEM degrees students has significant benefits, not only for students themselves, but also for the US economic growth and the whole society.

Reasons are:
1. Foreign students choose to take all the risks and come to the US for further study just because they believe the US would provide them with a freer, opener and bigger platform for their future development. Improving the training opportunities is exactly the way to prove their choice is right. If the training opportunities are not improved, it will largely discourage foreign students and affect their choice of country for further study. The economic contribution international students made to the education industry will be influenced as well.

2. Foreign students in STEM Degrees have been proved outstanding, there is no reason to kick those highly valued human resources out of the country. Their potential that can be used for the US industries is unlimited.
