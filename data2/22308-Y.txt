US is the greatest country in the world not because of its economy nor military power, but for its multiculturalism. We, immigrants, came here because this is a land where it offers equal opportunity for people with different skin colors. Everyone who is willing to build this country deserves a better chance to stay and further create more opportunities for both US citizens and immigrants. I will support this proposal, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, with no doubt.
