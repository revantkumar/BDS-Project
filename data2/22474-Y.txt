I believe OPT-extension is necessary for international students.
As it in the United States, how many of the citizens are originally from another country? It's not reasonable to place the rights of citizens over the non-citizens. Think about how United States accepted you or your grandparents first came here. Did anyone try to stop you from coming to this country?

For STEM students, as the technology grows faster and faster, the need for technology professionals are also growing all the time. There is no doubt that here in the United States, we have a lot of STEM professionals, but are those enough? Let's take a look at Google's number of employees. It grows from 16,000 in 2007 to 53,000 in 2014. Nobody knows what the number would be in another seven years, as those large tech companies develop more and more features and new technologies, more and more tech talents would be needed. I do believe by approving the OPT-extension, the United States would gain more than lose.

Please APPROVE the OPT-EXTENSION.
