In my opinion, this proposal is beneficial to US society in a long run. As we all know, US has attracted so many talented international students, which form one of strong powers to accelerate the economy, especially in high-tech fields. As economic globalization goes deeper, international students play an extremely important bond. I think it is a short-sighted strategy to cancel OPT extension because US citizens might lose their jobs. If US tech companies grow up actively, job market will become better and better, which means that US citizens can find jobs more easily. In order to realize it, one promising way is to work with international employees since they have more experience to cooperate with companies in their own countries.
