With unemployment so out of control. ( thousands of people have dropped off unemployment and gone straight to Wellfare program). Why take jobs from hard working American students. The STEM fields are challenging and difficult. A student must be dedicated and willing to sacrifice time and money to complete a degree in those fields. So, why spit in their face by telling them the govt. Will pay employers money to hire foriegn STEM workers. Any rational person with the ability to draw logical conclusions can see the result. Employers will save money to put in the CEO's pocket while hard working students will be left with a harder time finding meaningful employment. 

Also, the Federal deficit is running close to 17 trillion dollars. Why would you consider borrowing more money to hurt US workers.
