Hi. I think that having STEM extension program associated with international students can definitely help bring more talent and entrepreneurs to the US. May be all those students won't invent something but even if few can invent something or help solve some big problems exist in STEM field by doing research here, it can be a great help to the nation and the world. 

United States have always been welcoming to the people who want to migrate and stay here. And I think that's one of the major reason that America is greatest nation in the world. It's diversity helps it view different problems from different point of views that those people from different cultures bring with them and I think that can help solve many problems. 

Thank you for giving me chance to express myself on this critical issue. I definitely think that Govt should go ahead and implement STEM extension law they have proposed.
