Some citizens are starving in this country has nothing to do with OPT extension, though it could due to a lot of personal reasons or other social issues, but certainly OPT extension is not one of them. Actually, without international employee here in the US, some companies will go down since they can't find enough qualified workers to keep their company alive. You may argue, there are tons of unemployed US citizens, but the question here really is: can they handle the high-tech job well? are they really good at what they've learned?

Without the tax paid by those companies and international employees, then who is gonna be responsible for the loss of US economy? The situation might go worse for those starving senior citizens.

You said "Put the money and energy into the people on welfare, Am. citizens first, then others".
Well, this sounds like a starving kid. Let me tell you, as a citizen, you should not always ask, ask and ask what you need. You should ask yourself what you can do for this country as a citizen first, and trust me, payback will come to you without asking anything.
