It is time to stop this run away president, who seems to be doing anything he wants to do with no restrictions. If the rest of government is going to just stand by and provide no checks and balance, then why elect anyone else but the president (king). You allow foreign students to come over here and get a good education so they can return home and change their country but that's not the way it is working in this day and age. You are allowing them to come here receive an education then stay and change this country. WAKE UP WASHINGTON.
