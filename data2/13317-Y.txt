I strongly support this rule based on the following reasons. 

There are many outstanding STEM graduates contributing to the high tech companies in US. Despite the importance of the STEM majors, I see these majors are not the top choices for many local students. That is an important reason why US needs hardworking and high quality international students to help develop their academic and industrial research. Practically, compared to non-citizens, the US citizens usually get much higher priority when looking for admission to school, permanent jobs, fellowships, awards, etc. But still I see there are still many openings/positions that have to be filled by STEM graduates not because of financial incentives but simply because there are not qualified candidates or there are no citizens interested. Due to many reasons, many talents STEM graduates work more and ask less, and they keep contributing to the US society/economy in the key STEM fields. It will be a severe loss for US if the talent foreign students prefer to return instead of staying. Being attractive to international students/scholars is one of the most important reason why US is the strongest countries.
