I strongly SUPPORT new OPT extension proposal, through these years, many foreigners have made great contributions to this country, some people just said that these foreigners grab citizens' jobs, but if you citizens are competitive enough, how can this happen? So please try to find some inside reason instead of just being anti-foreign. Blind anti-foreign will result in secluding the country from the outside world.
