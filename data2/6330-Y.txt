I STRONGLY SUPPORT this rule for the following reasons: Firstly, as we all know, nowadays it is an era of technology and information, in the center of new technology development, there are talents. By OPT extension, the U.S. will become more attractive to talented students or workers around the world. In this way, high-technology companies get talents, which is the crucial piece in their development and students achieve their dreams by working in top companies of the world. It definitely is a win-win for not only students but also the industries in the U.S. Secondly, the U.S. has remained as the most powerful country for quite a long time, one of the reason, I believe, is its multi-culture and inclusiveness, OPT extension is consistent with this nation's tradition. Finally, some people may be worried that lots of international students may be counter productive to American workers, but actually it is not at all. Since talents from all over the world make contributions to the development of U.S. industries, the development will make more jobs opportunities, so in fact international workers are not taking opportunities, they are creating them.
