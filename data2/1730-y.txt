Qijing Xie OPT ia a great way to help different high-tech industries to retain talented employers. Unlike the H1B visa, it does not require employers to go through complicated paper work. International student in STEM makes up a great portion of all STEM students in the US and many are among the top group of students. Working int the bio research industry my own, I know many of the smartest and most hardworking people are internationals how are using or has once holds OPT. Extension of the OPT will greatly benefit US companies in a variety of fields. We can foresee with current day rapid growth of hi-tech industries all over the world, US will soon loses its leadership position if no action is taken to keep well-trained foreigners. Apart from that, cancel the OPT extension will potentially make international student less willing to come to US for college education! That means the US schools could lost a big portion of their income source. So please seriously consider the OPT extension!
