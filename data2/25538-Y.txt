This proposed rule is open to literally every foreign person in the entire world, regardless of his/her ability to successfully complete an education at any school in the United States: the regulation does not seek bright students. The F1 non-immigrant classification is available to certain academic students who seek temporary admission to the United States as full-time students at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution, or in an accredited language training program. In short, ANY and EVERY school is a qualifying school. Thus, by definition, any foreigner who wants to come to the United States. to attend elementary school qualifies under this regulation. The 9-1-1 terrorists would have qualified under this broad definition. There is already a LARGE problem with over-extended student visas; the monitoring of these people is bad joke. Frankly, I believe that dereliction of duty here is criminal.
