I strongly support this new rule. It allows many F1 students who receive education from the US contributing to this nation. This is one of the most important rule to keep our nation the most developed one in the world.
I am operating a high-tech company which has many F1-OPT employees from STEM major currently. As far as I can tell, they are doing amazing works. Some of them might get trouble getting H1B due to the quota limitation, thus OPT extension for STEM would be a great help for both them and my company. As a result, please allow me to repeat myself: I STRONGLY SUPPORT the extension of OPT-STEM rule.
