The STEM extension for F-1 students is needed because of various reasons.
Firstly because, we know that most of the graduate schools in US have a huge percentage of international students. These students pay a much higher tuition fee than the residents. So they have a significant contribution to the development of the education in USA. secondly once they get graduated, they tend to work with a lot of US companies in order to have some experience. They are well qualified and have a lot of skills which is not easy to acquire. They directly or indirectly contribute to the economy. We need more and more people like this to support the economy. They are the ones who are helping us move forward. Therefore giving them some more time is totally acceptable. Hence I support the increase in time for their STEM OPT time duration and also increasing the opportunities of training for them.
