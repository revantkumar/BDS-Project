Regarding the proposed mentoring and placement plan: Wouldn't this plan work better for those on Curricular Practical Training (CPT)? Afterall, those eligible for CPT are current students and it's appropriate for them to work via a mentorship program. The Mentorship Program is ideal not only for a college student, but for employers as well, as most understand the purpose of an internship is toprepare an individual for a future job in their area of academic interest. 

Now, if the Mentorship Program is put into place post-graduation, and post-one year of OPT, theres going to be problems with the employment both with the employee and manager. If we were to hire someone on OPT in a staff position and then after one year of employment, they apply for OPT STEM, their job dramatically shifts into an internship-type position and ceases to remain to be the same job the individual was originally hired to do. To equip students makes no sense. Those on OPT STEM are no longer students; they are post-graduates, many with MSc and PhD degrees, who are employed and gaining experience in their academic field. Most employers are already have yearly or yearly performance plans in place. And why would there be potential DHS/ICE site visits? Are government agencies really in a position to determine whether a private employer is ensuring their employee is succeeding, meeting the job goals, etc? 

There are a lot of great US employers following the rules and investing their time ensuring these graduates are successful in their careers -- it's a win-win for the employee and employer. Adding more outside bureaucratic layers to managing someone's job under these proposed conditions will weigh heavily in hiring practices.
