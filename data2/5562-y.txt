Lesley Harger We can no longer support the financial weights of foreign students and workers over the American people. We are In a Sea of drowning job losses and poverty in the middle and lower class in the UNITED STATES. America is in trouble and I implore those in authority of our nation to put AMERICANS FIRST FOR ONCE and do NOT extended foreign worker and student worker visas. Let AMERICANS WORK AGAIN! Thank you
