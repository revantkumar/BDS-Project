As an international student major in stem, I am convinced that this proposal, the extension of OPT will allow students major in stem contribute more to the prosper in the US. And the reason is that on one hand, the diversity of international students will benefit both students and U.S, and extension of OPT will offer companies related to stem major the chance to get employees worldwide. And the very reason that can push U.S. to an even more powerful country is to utilizing intelligence resource from all over the world. And this kind of situation has been proved in many areas. For example, in academic area, the diversity of both faculty and students made U.S. both the center and leader of academy. On the other hand, some might think that the extension of OPT will harm US citizens' employment to some extend. On the contrary, the existence of international employees will offer the chance for everyone to learn from each other, and make improvement at the same time. Employers are more concerned about the quality of their employees rather than where they come. And I think less of diversity will definitely let the quality of employees go down. The existence of international employees are more likely to be the catalyst rather than a threat.
