After reading this proposed rule I find that it is formally making the US government pay incentives to US Technical companies to hire foreign students over US employees and extending the amount of time a foreign student can stay on their VISA.

As a US citizen and graduate Engineer. I have enjoyed a very successful career from my education. The US has been very good to me and must be defended against the immigration of foreign technical workers at lower wages.

Instead of incentives we need to impose fines for hiring a foreign worker over a US citizen. You need to be canceling the OPT program in its entirety.
