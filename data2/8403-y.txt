Tony Salazar, Spanish Marketing Communications Regardless of the country of origin for these students, which university gave them their degree, or what is their discipline, it's senseless, ludicrous, and irresponsible to award them an extension to their work visa. Worse, it's corrupt and cronyism when the Federal government bribes the employers. All this fraudulent exercise will do is create a much higher national unemployment for the citizens and exacerbate the unethical and immoral practice of universities to accept huge amounts of foreign contributions to their endowment coffers. All in the name of greed and an insatiable hunger for enormous budgets.
