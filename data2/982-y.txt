Jaron Hightower-Mills As an international student advisor with a large number of students in STEM programs, I appreciate DHS quickly moving to re-introduce the rules relating to STEM Extension and Cap-Gap. 

However, I am curious as to why DHS decided to expand the application period for STEM OPT applications and not all OPT applications. Extending for all applications would have the same benefits outlined in the proposed rule. 

While I support not extending the STEM Extension to all degrees, I would hope that DHS would consider students who do STEM-related coursework for non-STEM degrees. I work with MBA students who complete a healthcare management specialization who I feel should have the option of applying of the STEM extension. 

Before the Mentoring and Training Plan is added as a SEVIS functionality, I hope that UCSIS and SEVP will work with employers and DSOs to understand what DHS would be looking for and how to work with employers and students.
