Thanks very much for making this policy and I give my full-hearted support. We all know that United States has always been a immigration country. Lots of immigrants and their children, grand children contributed a lot to this country, and are continuing to contribute. They bring different culture and jobs to USA. Without immigrants, there won't be Apple, Telsa and many other giants that boost up America's economy. I sincerely think we should help F1 students to stay longer and give them more opportunities to thrive here. It's not just for the students, it's also for the benefits of the whole economy and all Americans.
