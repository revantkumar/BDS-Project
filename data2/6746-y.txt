Carol Harris You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. Even with more than 13 million Americans unemployed, the manufacturing sector cannot find people with the skills to take nearly 600,000 unfilled jobs, according to a study last fall by the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte.
