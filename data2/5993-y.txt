Leo Liu I highly support the new proposal of expanding the training opportunities for international STEM degree students. From the side of American worker, yes, this will hurt some of people's benefits. However, from the long term, it will help this nation because of the competition. In addition, as more and more high talent and hard working non-immigrant students working in the US, more employment opportunities will be created from the market expansion. This is not only beneficial for F1 nonimmigrant students, but good for the nation in long term. In my opinion, it is not a wise decision to give F1 nonimmigrant students the best education in the world and then put them to use their talents somewhere outside. This proposal rule will benefit the industry, the nation and the nonimmigrant students.
