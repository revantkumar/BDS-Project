Jane Liang As far as I can see, this new OPT extension rule will definitely benefit not only international students in the STEM majors, but also all Americans as well as the whole nation.

First, this new rule will attract more international students, especially students in STEM majors to the US for advanced studies over other countries ( Canada, Australia, German, HongKong and etc.) , which will eventually benefit the US economy. As we all know, international students generally pay out-of-state tuition, which is double or even more than the money paid by local students. Combined with living expenses, one student may contribute tens of thousands dollars per year to the US economy, which brings huge job opportunities for local people. If this proposal was not approved, I believe it would be a great loss for the US.

Second, I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also good for OPT program. I am a PhD student in the Computer Science major. Based on my project experience at my school and my internships in big companies, most large research/software development projects always last at least 2 years or even more. If the OPT extension time was too short, foreign STEM employees worked on those projects would lose their VISA before the projects completion and this would definitely hurt the interests of US companies.

I think if you think deeply about this new OPT proposal, you will find it brings a win-win situation to both international students and the US nation. Everyone should support it!
