I'm strongly support this case. For these reasons.

1. Optional Practical Training is a key part of STEM degree students. And this is why other countries' students choose USA as study destination. If we cancel this part. I think USA will loose a lot of students from other countries.

2. Base on NAFSA data. During 2013 - 2014. there are 886052 international students provide 26.8 billion GDP to USA and support 340, 000 US citizens work. And as the increase of international students this benefit will be increase in future years. http://t.cn/RUOwpaE

3. Base on Economist data, each Hi-tech international worker will create 10 jobs for US citizen. And if US got those workers this will increase more and more jobs for US citizens.

4. Those international students also pay tax for US government. And someone says they don't pay that much tax. This is true. But those international student also don't have right to vote. So I think this is fair.

5. Those international students who want to chase the STEM major are always the smartest students in their countries. And for US government, it doesn't have to pay fee before university. This is a huge deal for USA.

6. US is a immigrant country, the immigration create the best country in the world. If government cancel this, US is not US anymore. 

This is my opinion, I hope you can check it. Thank you very much.
