As an international student majoring in STEM, I feel expanding training opportunities is necessary. Students invest time and money into studying in U.S. universities and they should get trained in U.S., it's an important part of education: applying what they have learnt into practice in the country where they study. Many people see this as an opportunity for immigrantion, however, the truth is we deserve the time and chance to work in U.S., not only for gaining experience, but also for the development of U.S. especially in certain industries. We have to admit that in many cases STEM international students perform better in some positions, like financial engineerer, programmer, etc. Thousands of admissions into big tech/finance companies have proved that there is also a large demand for STEM students. In all, I strongly support this rule to be passed.
