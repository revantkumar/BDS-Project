Jie Ren Hi there,
I had to say, the U.S. gives me a lot of thing for my future life. It is time for me to do something for feedback. But now, the chance is disappearing. I wanna bring more work opportunities for the society with my partner, although I am just OPT employee. We are working on a project, a kind of new material, which will bring million dollars and a lot of work opportunities, for the nuclear fusion, the NIF. If I left, the project will be stopped, and the chance will be lost forever. 
There are several reasons for the STEM OPT extension:
First, lower cost for the hi-tech employees. The Hi-tech companies need a lot of hi-tech employees for their businesses, but the citizens who are learning this major are too less to matching the needing. The STEM international students will cover the gap. 
Secondly, Most of citizens like be managers, the STEM international will never take their positions because their major.
Thirdly, the quantity of H1B for every year is limited by the government, and controlled by the government. The STEM OPT extension will never affect the H1B because they will never get any advantages from the extension.
Finally, some clever STEM international students may bring huge benefits for the U.S. Because they have some special resource. Human resources will be the most important resource for the society. The STEM Opt extension can keep the talents.
Thanks for reading.
