Krishna Mahesh Ommi I am Krishna Mahesh Ommi a F-1 student from Kent State University, after spending lot of money for quality of education available in US, as hundreds of world class Universities are giving us an opportunity to have our higher studies. We students who are not so rich also were taking education loans in our country and coming here believing that we can flourish here.

When we can have sufficient OPT time, it helps us to learn practical work in multinational companies which helps us to clear out hefty loans and their bulky interests. Moreover no student likes to settle over in US leaving their homes and their hometown. 

I will be personally very thankful, if you increase the extension for 24 months that will help us to utilize our 5 years VISA tenure completely.
