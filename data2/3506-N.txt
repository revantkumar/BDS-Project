This is outrageous. Our government should be looking out for the futures of American citizens, not foreign nationals. We have the highest percentage of Americans out of the workforce in modern history. To say that there is no American citizens who will take these jobs is a lie. I'm in contact daily with college students and we have no shortage of Americans with STEM degrees who also are buried in student loan debt. Stop giving these large corporations a modern day form of indentured servants simply because they don't want to pay a fair wage. It's high time the government quits looking out for the interests of greedy large corporations and look out for our working folk.
