This rule has many benefits for US companies, schools, etc.
1. I'm a software engineer and many of my friends are the same. Many of us are planning to return to home country after working here for 2-3 years. One major reason we come to study in US schools is that the higher education degree and work experience here make us more competitive and help us succeed in career development when we go back. The OPT extension will ensure that US colleges keep attracting more students like us.
2. Many of us are fairly paid. Also when we were looking for a job, many companies do not qualify for hiring us. So I don't see how this rule could cause much trouble to US citizens in job market since they obviously have the advantage in work permit if they are equally competent.
3. Many companies now have employees like us. The extension period gives both us and our companies time to better plan the future goals and development. I wouldn't say the company needs me that much, but it is definitely a big impact if I have to leave all of a sudden because of the work permit problem.
