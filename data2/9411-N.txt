There's great news if you're a recent college grad and you're looking for work. Washington has a program that provides a financial incentive for employers to hire you.

But only if you're a foreigner. U.S. citizens need not apply....

....Even though these are college graduates, DHS designates them as foreign students. Foreign students don't pay payroll taxes. And neither does the employer. The employer is exempt from paying the 6.2% Social Security and 1.45% Medicare taxes. That nearly 8 percent difference means an employer can save money by hiring a foreigner over an American.

this has got to stop....NOW. and now the govt wants to give financial incentive to employers to hire "foreign students". there are a LOT of people in Washington who need their heads examined!
