Extra OPT extension is a good strategy for the US tech industry. We know that tech companies are willing to keep international employees because of their good performance. In addition, they need international employees to fill in the void in the tech industry. However, these employees will get deported if their OPT expire or they don't get selected in the H1B lottery system. This can be cause huge talent loss for those tech companies especially those who heavily rely on them. Extra OPT extension can relieve the situation by allowing international employees to have more attempts in the H1B lottery, thus reducing the chances of tech companies' loss on these employees.

Besides, keeping international employees is not only good for tech companies, but also for each citizen in US. Tech companies rely on international employees to create values. The important thing is that the more values tech companies create, the more revenue they will have. This extra revenue will be converted to extra tax they pay to IRS, which every US citizen will benefit from.

Some US citizens object this bill and are concerned that this bill will place international employees over US citizens in job market. I don't think this is going to happen. US citizens is always on the top priority in the tech companies list because they can work here without any restrictions. Tech companies don't have to file H1B petition and worry about potential loss of employees like what they need to do to international employees. It was because of the lack of labor in tech industry that international employees can have an opportunity to come in. Extending the OPT extension just relieves, but not removes international employees' restriction. US citizens would still be considered first if they have the same skill set and capability as their international peers have.

Overall, I think this bill do nothing but benefiting the US tech industry and every US citizen.
