I am strongly opposed to extending/expanding the Optional Practical Training program. It's bad enough that we educate 
the rest of the world with our superior technology developed here, now we are trying to displace more American workers 
with foreign students. They will look attractive to employers because of the tax break that they bring. So what happens 
to the Americans? They are forced onto the public dole at our expense. How disheartening for them. This appears to
be the way that you, our American government, like it. It gives you total control over them-over more of society. These 
foreign students promised to leave after graduation, not take jobs. Let them go home. Let's get more of our own people back

to work.
