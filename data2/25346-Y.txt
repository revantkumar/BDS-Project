The benefits of expanding OPT are three-fold: (i) It will present a great opportunity for international students with STEM degrees to transform what they have learned in class into practical experience. This serves as a very necessary transition step from classroom students to working professionals. (ii) Longer STEM OPT will allow graduates to explore different job opportunities before eventually finding themselves ideal job fit. (iii) STEM graduates provide active and energetic labor force to high-tech companies in the US. Revoking 17-month STEM OPT and only retaining 12-month post-completion OPT would not be an ideal option to consolidate US economy because it will definitely hurt high-tech companies who benefit from STEM graduates. Moreover, it will make US less attractive to future international STEM students because they know that they will not have much time (only 12 months) to gain working experience after graduation.
