First of all, do we have following statistic data:
1. How many open positions of STEM major that US needs each year?
2. How many US citizens or PRs are unemployed who have STEM major degree?
3. How many STEM major students come back to their home country after OPT? and How many stay in the US by changing their immigrant status like applying for H1B?

If there's even one unemployed US worker, he/she shall be considered to be employed before granting longer OPT time.

So before making decision, please have those data clear.
