Well another bold step by the Department of Homeland Security to boost the economy of The USA. From a US resident point of view, this may hurt the chances of unemployed individuals for now but in the global market USA will be a robust economy for the next decade there by paving a path for steep dip in unemployment. 
World will be looking out for opportunities in America as it has become a country with no borders in inviting skilled professionals and building a Shangri-la. 
My suggestion to DHS is to extend OPT period to 24 months and then if an international student opts for STEM OPT extension then he/she should be provided with a 48 months extension during which they will not be eligible to file for H-1 work visa. 
This way number of H-1B visas issued can be controlled and employer can have a safe bet in employing skilled professional for tenure as long as 6 years without another Visa. 
Working alongside these international skilled professionals, a less skilled US employee can acquire the knowledge and skills and thus increasing the productivity of US nationals there by reducing the dependency at later stages.
Also students opted for STEM OPT extension must be provided with a minimum pay(>$100,000 pa) to minimize the effect of ineligibility of filing H1 work Visa.
