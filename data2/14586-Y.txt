At this point, I strongly recommend that the OPT period for STEM students be extended by 24 months. From my perspective, I would say this action is not only a huge benefit for those nonimmigrant students to release their limitless potential in the expected future, but also has a conspicuous and penetrating impact on the stronger competitive power of U.S. society. Here is a super multicultural, diversified and super inclusive society. It is these very features as a whole that makes what the country is like now, which of course should never be abandoned.
