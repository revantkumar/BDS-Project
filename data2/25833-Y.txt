I strongly support this rule. I'm a lecturer at an university in souther California. The international students at my class are among the brightest I've seen and I hope they have the opportunities to get the training and experience they need after graduation. Job market is tough for them not because we don't have enough jobs (in fact, the employment rate is 5.9% the lowest since 2008) but because it's nowadays hard to get a long-term visa for them. I don't want the best minds in my class to leave the country because we are narrow-minded and afraid that they could take away our jobs.

Yours,
David Clarkson
