I believe this proposal is great for all the Americans. There are three reasons listed below.
First and foremost, a lot of jobs that graduated Americans would not like to do with low pay and long work time could be done by graduates from other countries. If international students can not work after school, there will be huge vacancies for a lot of high-tech companies. So no doubt there will be a huge lost in the financial area.
Secondly, it has been years that international graduates can be working in US only if they are qualified. It means those who are working under OPT visa are very talent, smart and creative person who can make great profit for their companies and of course to the whole America economy. 
Last but not least, universities can also get benefit from this proposal. We are looking more and more into a person's ability but not his/her academic scores. So working after graduation in US is also a great way for international student to challenge and improve themselves. This is a key point for students when they are choosing universities. If they are not able to work after graduation, I believe the total amount of foreign students would be a lot less them it is now.
To conclude, it is very important to pass this proposal for the sake of the whole American economic growth. People should think about what is the negative side to oppose this proposal, which has a lot bad influence on the America as a whole.
