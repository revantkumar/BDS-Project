The STEM OPT not only provides F-1 students with practical training opportunities, but benefits US industry with numerous talents from across the globe every year. It's worth noting that 12 months is usually insufficient for students to fully contribute to their training projects, and if they have to leave US early, the US industry will suffer while students are still in lack of practical exposure. Considering that the US is in dire need of STEM talents, and F-1 students are hired by the same (or even higher) standard as natives, the STEM OPT extension in no way cut back on job opportunities of US citizens. This proposed rule is the keystone for America to maintain its leadership in STEM, and for the academic institutions to remain first choices before the non-US ones for international students. I strongly suggest that this rule be passed and the US government take extra care with unjustified comments spammed by anti-immigration groups.
