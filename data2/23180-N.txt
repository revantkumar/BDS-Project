We do not need a program of this type. We have many graduates from universities here with this training. Replacing Americans with foreigners is not the way to solve America's problems. All it does is save corporations money by hiring workers willing to work for lower wages. Ask Disney about this. They replaced many American workers with foreign workers and even expected the American workers to train their replacements. Enough is enough. Citizens are being cast aside to make room for aliens.
