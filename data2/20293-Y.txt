I completely agree with you over here. This does goes on here. It is really sad. Saying that, I am an indian too and i am on F1 visa too however, that does not mean every indian is going through a fraud way to get a job. People like me use the right means. However, i completely agree that many indian students use illegal ways to attain a job and i am completely against it. I believe in equality and using the right means to succeed.
