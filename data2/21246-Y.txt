America is a nation of immigrants. Some of the most successful companies in the U.S. were founded by immigrants. The current president of the U.S., Obama is a second generation immigrant from Kenya. High skill legal immigrants contribute to this country economically, socially, and culturally. 

Limiting legal immigrants time or chance to work in the U.S. violates the fundamental principle that this country is founded on. It will hurt U.S. economy, especially to tech and financial sector where U.S has comparative advantage in.
