Sonali Surve I support this rule of 24-month OPT STEM extension so that many students on F1 OPT status can maintain their work status. Due to the lottery system of H1B visa and large number of applications, it is getting difficult for these students to continue their employment. With the 24-month OPT STEM extension, students can get multiple chances to apply for H1B visa and thus continue their employment. I request the Government to make approve this as a rule as soon as possible.
