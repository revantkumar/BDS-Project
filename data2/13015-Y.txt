I strongly support the proposed rule. Instead of commenting all the good things this proposed rule is going to bring to this country, I'd like to point out the serious impact it would have from not passing this rule. If the OPT extension is suddenly canceled, there will be a big and sudden shrinkage in our labor force. How are we going to fill this big gap right away without enough qualified candidates?
