shaokai ye It is going to hurt the quality of U.S universities if second term of opt does not go through. It is obvious that a lot of universities keep their quality of education by accepting international students who are willing to pay tuition 2 times as expensive for their their education. While most of them will not be able to stay in this country for too long, the money they spend have been helping U.S economy and quality of education.

For most of STEM students I know, including myself, studying abroad is supposed to be 4 years undergraduate and 1 or 2 years industrial training. Without the second term of OPT, a lot of perspective students will reconsider their decisions.
