Charles Zhang First of all, to address one of the primary concerns from the opponents of the proposed policy, the extension of OPT will not lower the possibility for employment for US citizens and residents. This is due to the fact that this policy is only applicable to students of STEM majors while according to statistics from US Department of Education, there remains a severe shortage in people working in STEM-related work fields.

Furthermore, a great number of renowned tech firms(e.g.Instagram) were founded by students who were in fact once on OPT. Thus, in a long term, the extension of OPT will help create more job opportunities and keep US in the leading position in terms of science and technology advancement.

Last but not least, the success of US today is rooted in its embracement of foreign talents. This is especially evident during the second World War when the influx of foreign talents helped boost the development of US post-war economy. Thus, as shown in history, it is beneficial for US to welcome international students with more open-mindedness.
