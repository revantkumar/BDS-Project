I strongly support the OPT extension proposal for the following reasons: 

First, the spirit of the United States is always equality, fair, freedom, as the international students, we also need the fair opportunity to seek the jobs.

Second, all the STEM international students are all have advanced degrees, they can make huge contributions to the Americans society after they find a job. Through their efforts, they can promote the development of Americans economy, at the same time, to create more job opportunities for citizens.

At last, education industry has already became the most important part of Americans industry. Every year, lots of international students come to the United States, bring much benefits. If this proposal will be denied at the last, Im afraid the United States will lose unexpected benefits.

So, I think no matter from economy, education and society, we should support this proposal.
