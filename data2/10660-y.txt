Jan Clark International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. This will ensure continuous supply of young talented STEM graduates and promote growth of science and technology.
