I support US government to improve and expand training opportunities for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. Training opportunities not only provide a chance to practice what international students learn in schools, but also benefit US and its people directly and greatly.
As we all know, it is a competitive process for internationals students to apply for and study at US universities. The students who finally come and study here always are those who are well-educated and talented in their home countries.
Second, the companies and industries need those excel international student to help and contribute local community and even improve the world. For example, Google and Amazon, the well-known high tech, improve our life a lot, to make us more efficient communication between each other, to learn faster and fairly by internet search and to make our life more convenient like driverless vehicle and shopping online. All of those are just small part of high tech companies like Google's and Amazon's contributions to US and the world. However, because of the lack of American local students, the fast development of industries like high-tech urgently need international students to help them to improve the world. 
Finally, STEM-related industries will also accelerate the development of industries in non-STEM fields. This keep the overall economic growth persistently and prosperously, resulting in more job opportunities for all over American people. 
Therefore, I strongly agree on that Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.
