I strongly support the proposal. It gives the opportunity for foreign students to make contributions to the US and also increase the diversity in the country.

Many people object the proposal with reasons like there are lots of US citizens unemployed, there are enough citizens work in the STEM area or citizens have to accept lower pay to compete with foreign students. These statements are narrow minded and don't stand. The unemployed citizens are incompetent to do the jobs well in their positions. And even though there are enough amount of citizen in the STEM area, it doesn't mean the positions don't need better employees to be filled. What made US the most innovative country in the world is it attracts talents around the world. Foreign students can bring competitions, but it results in more efficient and better workforce in different areas. And that makes the United States outstanding. 

I really hope that this proposal can be passed and benefits the United States.
