I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. I'm a homeowner in California and almost all of my tenants are international students at a nearby state university as most of the domestic students there live at home and commute. 
Not just me--the community as a whole has benefited from the large population of international students. We welcome them to our homes, our restaurants, and our churches, and I always enjoy talking to this diverse and talented group of young people who, like most of us, believe in this great country and its education.
I'll be glad to see them stay here longer, gain more valuable industrial experience, and make greater contributions to our economy and society.
I on behalf of my community give my strongest support for the OPT extension!

2. OPT extension will attract more international students. Countries such as United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. This proposal will provide United States more attractions.

3. U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries.
