It is highly inappropriate that students overstay their visas. These are the people that can return and help their respective countries. When they overstay their visas they break the law. When they return, this country usually has a friend. It is exactly treasonous that our executive branch would give preference to any student here on a visa over a U.S. citizen. The harm it does is great. Think depletion of our nation's resources, betrayal of our citizenry, destruction of wildlife habitat, undermining unemployment reduction, increased over congestion of our urban areas and so on. Our executive branch is ignoring the checks and balances stipulated in our Constitution and that is very bad.
