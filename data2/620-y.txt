Zhihao Li I STRONGLY SUPPORT the rule.

When I chose my grad school, I had several options: U Toronto (Canada), ETH Zurich (Switzerland), Cambridge (UK), HKUST (Hong Kong) and CMU (US). I declined all other prestigious schools to come to CMU (United States) not just because CMU is renowned in CS realm (all other institutions listed above have world-leading CS grad schools as well), but also because besides the educations, US also provides opportunities for international students to practice what they learned during OPT. I value this practical experience.

Hundreds of thousands international students are just like me, choosing US for more comprehensive education experience, where students can not only learn from school, but learn from real world. Without such unique and comprehensive education experience, studying in US is just like studying in other countries.

I now live in an apartment complex near CMU, where 80% of residents are international students. It is disastrous to the local apartment management companies if the number of international students decrease, which will definitely happen if OPT expansion rule is not passed.

At CMU, many of my professors are not US citizens. They once were international students. They came to United States for education and stayed here to contribute to US. If US fails to attract more international talents, five or ten years later, US will lose the leading position in technology. And there will not be as many talented professors at US universities. The competitivity of US research organizations will be harmed.
