I strongly support the 24 month extension policy. When I was deciding where to go to school for my master degree, opt extension makes United States a better choice for me. Without the extension, I won't come to America to study, because there is not enough time to me to work and gain working experience here. If there is no extension, much less people will come to America for education.
