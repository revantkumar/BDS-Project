I strongly support the rule for the following reasons:
1. STEM fields are boosting the country's economy. Allowing more talented students around the globe will foster growth in STEM fields, and create more job opportunities for the US.
2. According to current laws and regulations, before hiring foreign citizens companies have to prove that no American citizens meets the job requirements. Therefore, if foreign students were not able to work in the US because of the visa cap, those jobs would not go to US citizens either. Instead, companies would become more motivated to move those jobs overseas or to outsource the job to foreign companies. This will hurt the US economy in the long run.
3. Economy development is not a zero-sum game. Attracting US-educated foreign talents to work for the US will not take the jobs away from Americans, but instead create more opportunities for the country as a whole.
