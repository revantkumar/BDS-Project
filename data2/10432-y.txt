Brian Alkins The whole Optional Practical Training program is just a way for high tech companies to get cheap foreign labor by under
cutting the "American" workers. The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional
Practical Training program is a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program will
allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the America. This
will expand the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As
a result, this will put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. The program actually incentivizes employers to hire
foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration
policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
