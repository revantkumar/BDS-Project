Michelle Massey I'm concerned that students can use past degrees to be eligible for STEM OPT. This doesn't work with the current regulations that indicate that work done in OPT and STEM OPT must be related to the most recent degree of study, which is soon to be more heavily scrutinized. How can a student work in the field of their most recent degree of study if they are using a previous degree to be eligible for the STEM Extension? Appreciation on this point would be clarified in the final rule. Thank you!
