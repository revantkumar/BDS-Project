These people need to be sent back to their home countries so US citizen STEM workers can get back to work.
The US STEM labor market is awash with unemployed US citizens many of whom have been ousted from their careers by foreign workers on one or other of the absurd alphabet soup of work visas and this outrageous program.
Some points to consider:
The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.
The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers.
Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.
OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.
Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.
OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.
OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.
This program just like the abysmal H-1B visa program is a US citizen work force replacement program and needs to be scrapped in its entirety without delay.
