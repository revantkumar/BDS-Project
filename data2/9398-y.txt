Anonymous There are a lot of ignorant comments on here from flag-waving citizens who seem to think all that foreign students are terrorists. It is unfortunate that these uneducated views are being showcased as the views of our country. These foreign students are an asset that we cannot afford to lose. To start, they are bringing revenue into our country in many forms:

1. College tuition - They bring money from their country and spend it here on college tuition. They don't qualify for student aid, so there is nothing being taken from citizens.

2. Income tax - While employed here, they pay income tax with every paycheck.

3. Sales tax - They spend their earnings here at retailers, which generates sales tax revenue for local economies.

People also don't realize how much STEM jobs are in demand right now. We have severe job shortages, and with our society becoming more technology-dependent, we need educated workers more than ever. Unless we see a rise in American citizens earning STEM degrees, then we will continue to need educated foreign workers to help advance our economy.
