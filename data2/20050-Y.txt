I very much support this regulation. The universities, government, students, companies, industries are all investing a great deal of time, money and effort into the education and it is unfair to expel them out of the country before students could make any contribution to the industry, or simply to fulfill themselves, not to mention what the nation has been advocating, the American Dream.
