Anonymous Hello,

I am writing in strong support of this new rule. We all know that this new rule is being published to bring back the 2008 rule for opt extension that was vacated this year. I feel that letting opt students work in USA for more period in time helps the nation and the student . the student can practise his/her advanced degree and at the same time help nation build by doing that. Specifically stem is important because a nations strength is stem apart from healthcare which is totally different vertical. Anti opt lobbiests will fight saying that it is not under national interest , however they are missing an important point here and that it time and again these international students who gain knowledge in their higher education use it in their work and create more jobs, more opprtunities and in turn more economy. If opt stem extension is cancelled I can definitely think about students opting to other countries and take away the brains there. If we want to build companies like Microsoft, Google , Apple etc we need international students, we need their brains. All these diverse minds should come together to make this a wonderful place to live and care for. I support this new regulation and I urge that the international students should be given further interest, and benefits just like an American graduate in this new generation America. God bless America.
