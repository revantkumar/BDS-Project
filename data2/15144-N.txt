Once again it appears that our current administration is out to slight our own citizens. This is a flagrant misuse of a program that was not intended to be used in the manner being deployed. It will cost Americans jobs at a time that they are desperately needed, take revenue from social security, and leave many more foriegners roaming around our country with no security checks in place. It is benefit to large companies at the expense of the shriveling middle class. A loophole being used to subvert the other systems in place and cheat our workforce out of jobs. This type of twisting of the rules in place must stop! Uphold the laws of our land and put our countrymen first!
