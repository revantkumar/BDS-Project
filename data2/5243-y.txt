Carlos Mendoza I believe this would not only be an advantage for the international students but also for the US. Currently thousands of students come abroad US for higher education, they pay huge amounts of money in the form of tuition, living expenses, bank accounts. Their every expenditure counts with a minimal tax amount which in turn is profitable for the US gov. After the education STEM extension of 24 months would provide more opportunities in terms of knowledge and work. More work means more tax money, so i feel this rule will really have a huge positive impact on the economy.
