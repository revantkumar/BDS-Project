This is insanity.
The Department of Homeland Security, the ICEB, President Obama, none of these have the right to make rules regarding immigration or student status.
ONLY the congress has this authority and this "rule" is a blatant violation of United States Law. The people proposing it should be dismissed and replaced with Americns who respect our constitution and the separation of powers.

The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to 
corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from 
one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid
paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of 
greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.
