This desire to "improve and expand training opportunities" for nonimmigrant STEM students is a blatant attempt by private industry to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare taxes as well as the prevailing wage. It is exploitation of foreign students and the shunning of American workers in order to maximize profits of the corporations which would participate in this fraud.

The last thing we need is to displace more American workers In this struggling economy where the labor-participation rate is at its lowest level in over 35 years and wages are stagnant. Increasing immigration merely creates a situation of too many workers and not enough jobs; therefore, wages for the average worker remain the same but the profits of the companies for which they work skyrocket.

Now is not the time to flood the market with more foreigners; we need to tighten the labor market and allow wages to rise through the rebalancing of jobs and workers.

Why would the government want to forego collecting Social Security and Medicare taxes in this time of spiraling debt?

The only winner in this situation is big business; the federal government and the American worker are the losers.
