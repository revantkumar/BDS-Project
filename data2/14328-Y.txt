It is overall a positive OPT Stem Extension of 24 months to all the international students.But considering the strict rules while extending the OPT, the employer and employee needs to submitted lot of paperwork to DHS for approval,it would be great if DHS give permission for 36 months extension. Lot of international exposure will be gained by the students during their OPT period. Moreover extension of 36 months OPT will also helps the international students to gain exposure and return back to their home country with lot of experience they gained during their job. 36 months of OPT provides smooth exit of international students from USA with international IT exposure.
