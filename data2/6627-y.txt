Xingchen Ma I strongly agree with the proposed 24-month OPT extension for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. Companies of the United States have benefited a lot from hiring international students with STEM degrees, and so does the overall economy of the country. International students with STEM degrees have gone through great training in math, science and engineering, and would become future leaders in science, technology, finance and other industries. They would provide their skills and knowledge, bring in new technology and make profits for firms in the United States, and help the economy of the country. Thus, I strongly support the 24-month STEM OPT extension.
