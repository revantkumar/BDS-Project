I strongly support this new OPT policy. 

First, a lot of high-tech companies especially internet company hire a lot of international students. If OPT extension was canceled, these companies would have to take large loss in the following year due to the rehiring, which would also be a bad news for the US economy.

Second, most of international students who studying here have good family financial support. When they work here with OPT extension, their consumption could stimulate economic growth.

Third, OPT extension does not mean international students can stay in America forever. If they cannot get H1B and the OPT extension is over simultaneously, they still must go back to their countries.
