Andy M. OPT program extention for foreign students sucks - it is a bad deal for USA and our future - foreign students who are smart enough get jobs through campus selection...so why do we need OPT program for??? I know it's for the companies to use(abuse) OPT foreigners and save a lot on taxes and paychecks...So what about American students and skilled workers? They end up losing their jobs due to this OPT program as companies hire them and save a lot(they do not pay payroll taxes if they hire F1 students on OPT program). F1 students are foreign students who come to US for education and get the jobs on OPT program without any prior experience. Please save American STEM jobs by saying NO to OPT program...this program is a threat to the experienced STEM workers and American students......
