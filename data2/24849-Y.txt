United States is famous for its equality to everyone who live in this land, but now, they want to take away opportunities from others who deserve same equality.
Two hundred years ago, the government publish a rule against Asian, which strongly violate its country's principle of democracy.
No one could deny that foreigner play a significant role in different area of US industry, we came from different culture, we bring different ideas from different culture, this create a lot of amazing innovative in different areas, I have coworkers who come from India, Korea, Japan and Vietnan, Malalysa, we share our ideas and we work hard and try our best to learn more and gain more experience here, we pay a lot of tuitions because we believe the knowledge and experience worth the price, but now, if we only have one year work authorization, how could we gain experience and even worse, who will hire a person that can only work in this company for one year? Sounds ridiculous, if this rule has been terminated, more students will go to other countries for study instead of USA, that's will be a big loss for the whole society of American, that will sacrifice millions of people benefit instead of that hundred of people.
