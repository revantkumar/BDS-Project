I really agree on this policy. 

1. don't forget how the U.S. become the most powerful country in the world. So many scientists came to the US during the Second World War from Europe. They made the US develop vastly. 
2. it's not true that Americans' job will be affected. The positions open to foreigners are limited every year. That means the rest of the students will go back to their homelands.
3.What I learn from my university is that no matter how developed and how rich a country is, unemployment will always exist. There is no relationship with how fierce the competition is.
