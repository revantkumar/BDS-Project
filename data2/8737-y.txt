Li Yan I think this is a great proposal. 

First many companies have great need for STEM students, but some of them cannot recruit STEM employees simply due to short validity time of OPT compared with increasing H1B applications.

Second, considering the overhead of hunting a job, a longer OPT validity time can make a STEM find a better match.
