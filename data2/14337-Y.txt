I am strongly convinced that expanding OPT for STEM students with F-1 visa.I believe that the United State welcome talent students from all over the world. It is impossible for them to make contributions to U.S. without a legal visa. STEM students have been studying and investing many efforts to pursue higher education.They usually work twice hard than Americans to success in school and work. Why can't U.S. provide the opportunities to receive the benefit from them. It is very clear to say extending OPT can both benefit U.S. and the students.
