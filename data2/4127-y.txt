Runzhi Zhang I strongly support this new proposal. 

Firstly, the 24 month extension means STEM students can have 2 more chances to get a working visa, it encourage more and more people in these important fields to come to US to contribute their efforts. 

Secondly, STEM students can gain a lot of valuable hand-on experience from their field in this extra months.

Some may concern that too many international student will reduce the opening positions for locals. Let's take a deeper dive into this problem. These stem students can only work for the companies which do not require citizenship. I went to several technical career fair. A great amount of companies which require citizenship have opening positions namely some government related company and aerospace related companies. What's more, when an american candidate and a foreign candidate apply for the same position at the same time, hiring an american means the company do not need to pay an extra great amount of money for sponsoring visa and hiring immigration lawyers. However, why so many STEM student got hired in these field? Simply because there is a great need in US technical field, the local work force is not enough. 

The last but not least. Tech company in US need diversity of their employee. They will shed some new light to their current field. Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Apple these companies have lots of current and previous STEM students. Some of them are developers, some of them are supervisor and some of them are directors. They are different person in different positions, but all of them are realizing American Dreams in different ways. This is the reason why American is the strongest country in this world, be united and embrace diversity!
