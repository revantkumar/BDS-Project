Fergie Cameron The improving and expanding training opportunity plan is a booster for the US economy and will provide more job opportunities. First, US government has spent much money and efforts to attract international elites to come to the US for higher education. It is ridiculous to banish these genius out of the states after cultivating them for years. Second, by keeping these international elites in the US, our engineering strength will still lead the world in the 21st century. Right now, more and more faculties in the US college are first generation American. If we didn't give them an opportunity in the past, we would neither have so many faculties in the college right now, nor have so many qualified faculties in the college right now. Last, America is a nation built by immigrants, it made America the strongest country in the world in the 19th and 20th century, and the America will maintain the superpower in the 21st century with a friendly immigration policy. The most valuable resources for a country in the 21st century is not gold, is not oil, is not natural gas, it is the number of talented people in that country. Therefore, banish talented people is hurting our future.
