I strongly agree the extension of the OPT program. I don't want to mention it again that the Unite States rely on thousands of immigrants to become the most powerful country, but I think the people against this program are just afraid of having a second Albert Einstein in this country. Extending the OPT program does not necessarily mean to rip people off from the jobs, since the U.S. students still have every advantage to get what they want to be (much much easier than foreign students). The U.S. people should not view the OPT program as the obstacle along their job career, since no one can stop what they pursue.
