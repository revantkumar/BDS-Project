Bruce Donaldson I'm a small business owner and employer of almost 100 high technology subject matter experts. On their behalf, I implore the Administration to not expand the ability of foreigners to take American jobs. I attend several job fairs every year looking for additional IT employees and these are full of foreign students and foreigners on work visas looking to move into other positions. There are more than enough high technology educated Americans who are qualified and want the work. Importing more people only cuts their salaries or throws them out of work.
