Actually I am a little bit surprised to see some Americans fighting against this rule that badly. The stronger people fight against this rule, the stronger people show their incompetence and unconfidence landing a job in the current job market. For those people who are afraid of competing with international students, they should improve their skills instead of complaining. Americans already have a lot of advantages comparing to the international students looking for a job, and now if they say only by stopping the legal working right for international students and only by driving international students away from this country can they get a job would only make me feel they are just begging for a job. I am wondering are they actually capable of doing their job?

I guess most Americans have been fooled around by some news about companies issuing H1B to people in foreign countries or outsourcing and firing people in local departments. That is nothing to do with OPT extension. OPT extension only helps companies to maintain employees who have already worked for a year in US and who can keep contributing to the organization in the future. In China, we are always open to talented foreigners to come and work for us, and we would do everything to attract and keep talented people to stay. It is quite obvious that stopping this rule would only force more companies to issue more H1B directly to foreigners in foreign countries.
