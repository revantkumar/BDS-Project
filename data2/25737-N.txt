I am totally against this plan: "not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes."

"a 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors."

"Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields."

Please ensure that my grandchildren will have the first choice at employment in the US when they finish their college educations. 

STOP all this immediately and PROTECT our jobs and future.
