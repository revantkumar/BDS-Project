I'm an international analytical chemistry master student from China and I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. One of the most important reasons that I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country without this OPT extension rule. And I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents if there was no OPT extension rule. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on long term project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.

As I'm a Chinese STEM student, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. 

I really hope more people support this good rule!
