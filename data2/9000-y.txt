Angela Johnston A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership and quantitative skills. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. Expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. Many jobs are going unfilled simply for lack of people with the right skill sets.
