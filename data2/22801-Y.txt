I support this regulation for the following reasons:

1. Attracting more and more foreign STEM students to study in US and work for US will benefit this country and keep the country to be the strongest in the world.

2. The current limited H1B quota cannot give each STEM student the opportunity to work for US, the the extension of OPT is crucial to keep the smart students and give them opportunity to apply to H1B visa.

3. Many high tech companies rely on foreign STEM students, the extension of OPT will help those companies to retain their talents.

4. These foreign STEM students are asset to this country and we shall try our best to keep them as legal immigrants and make them to serve this country.

Thank you!
