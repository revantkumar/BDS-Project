Why is it that I am a US citizen, who has parents that are US citizens, who has grandparents that are US citizens and who has great grandparents who are US citizens, yet I have not received any special opportunities whatsoever in my path in the STEM fields. This kind of legislation hurts students and residents who have actually earned the right to take these opportunities, as opposed to immigrant students and workers that will take our place. I recently attended a talk at my local college regarding STEM opportunities, however the entire talk was about helping minorities. While I was there though, as I looked around I was the only single Caucasian male in the entire audience of over 100 people. Who exactly is the minority?
