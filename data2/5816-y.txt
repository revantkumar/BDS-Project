Adam Davis 1. International students with an OPT program DO pay tax and even more, since they have to rent and live, they support civil economic development in United States.
2.International students actually do NOT take American workers' jobs. The STEM jobs are taken by international students is just that companies can't find a native candidate with the required expertise.
3.Yes, a lot of international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, and then they get their green cards, even join US as a citizen. All of those base on their hard and hard work, which is exactly the "American Dream" - "a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.
4. United States need more talented workers across the globe, international students with an extension OPT program can help on this to keep United States' companies more competitive.
So Strongly SUPPORT to extend the OPT program for the STEM international students
