Zhenkang Yao I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE for the following reasons:
1. U.S. has made a best country in the world by the immigrant-friendly culture, and I believe that it will gives everyone equal chance to the talented students who come to the U.S. to study. They deserves more time to practice their skill after graduation.
2. Foreign nationals are also consumers for the U.S., the more time they stay here the more money they will spend. In fact, foreign nationals usually spend more money than Americans. It is good for the U.S. economy.
3. It is good for the U.S. education system, because longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in the U.S., it will make the U.S. education system diversified.
