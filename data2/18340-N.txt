I am against the Optional Practical Training act for foreigners. What about making it for Americans only. Maybe this is not politically correct but I think America should be and is and was supposed to be a homeland for the white race. Obama is the President not a king and he should not try to go around the will of the people but I'm not surprised he's trying it. Do you think the American people would be in favor of giving their country away to nonwhite people? The very fact that I would have to explain this stuff proves how out of touch our so called "leaders" are. I mean this is supposed to be a "Democracy" isn't it!? It's very simple, there are too many people out of work. Now quit giving the jobs away to foreigners.
