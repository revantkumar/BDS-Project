So as a nation we complain about a lack of STEM graduates coming out of college, yet we want to allow more US jobs to go to STEM grads who are not US citizens? How does this help us as a nation on a long-term basis? You want more STEM grads? Then let the market create demand. Good paying jobs will drive the market demand and then US graduates will fill them, but that demand won't happen if companies are allowed to keep wages down by hiring foreigners.
