I strongly OPPOSE this proposed new rule. Lacking qualified STEM workers is a big lie fabricated by greedy corporations, billionaires and dirty politicians they bought. If it's true, why no company is offering any on-job training to millions of unemployed Americans? It's all about increasing labor supply so they can enjoy lower labor costs and higher profits, while millions of unemployed Americans can not even put food on the table. No democratic country can treat its own citizens this way. We need to stop this insanity! 

A side note, many Indian and Chinese websites are calling for their students to post supporting comments on this topic under FAKE American names, multiple times a day. Go figure.
