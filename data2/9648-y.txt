Wenjin Huang My name is Wenjin Huang. I am a master student in Computer Science.

I strongly support this rule.

I think it is American spirit to give everyone equal chance. Outstanding foreign students have brought no harm but production to the United States throughout the history.

Please note, this rule is ONLY for NONIMMIGRANT STUDENT with STEM(SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, MATH) DEGREES. Having such students to work here will improve and accelerate the development of American technology in a large extend. 

Some may say that foreign students are stealing jobs from the citizens. I DISAGREE with that. 
From my experience, local students still have the advantage and priority to get hired. If a foreign student and a native student have the same level of knowledge and experience for a position, the native student will get picked anyway. Also, not every company has the authorization to hire foreign students with OPT extensions. Opportunities, especially compared to the citizens, are still very limited to us. I DON'T think it is fair to say we are stealing Americans' jobs because we don't have the same amount of chances here to begin with.

America is developing so fast in technology that it requires talented foreigners to catch up with the speed. We have the skills that America needs. America is simply providing the opportunities for us to work a little longer here in return. 

NOT everyone can work in the fields that we work in. This rule is going to benefit two sides of the fence. Being against this rule is not going to help the hiring for unqualified citizens in these areas, because America will still find other ways to fill in the need.

I hope this rule can go through in the near future.
