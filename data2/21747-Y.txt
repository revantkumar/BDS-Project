I strongly support this new rule as it will provide opportunity for the bright and most educated minds from all over the world to spend more time in the United States and make significant and valuable contributions in the field of STEM. This will not only help the students get valuable experience in the industry, but will also ensure that the Us economy stays healthy and progressive with continuous development in STEM. Also it will encourage more students overseas to consider having education in the US as they will be ensured of quality work experience after completing their education leading more revenue to US Universities and more bright minds in the States.
