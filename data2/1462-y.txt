David Turner I FULLY SUPPORT the OPT extension proposal for the following reasons:

1.International students are NOT as described as cheap labor or using U.S. funds. Cheap labor is NOT the word we should use for international STEM students who work in the U.S. The STEM students all experienced high education in the U.S. for two or more years.They learned knowledge from U.S. universities and they should keep making contributions to the U.S. They are LEGAL TAX PAYERS and they make more contributions to the economy than the most U.S. citizens.

2. Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) related industries are great contributors (around 55%) to the US GDP (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2014 data) .Highly educated immigrants are great workforceextending F1 students will benefit these major GDP driver areas.

3.The reason why most international students choose U.S. is they can work in U.S. for a period of time after graduating from school.This policy gives the US education an edge in attracting high quality students from other countries all around the world.Since they pay higher tuition, the institutes have more funds to improve their facilities and provide more professional services to all the students. 

4. U.S. is the greatest country only because it was founded on the belief that freedom and opportunities can be pursued on this land by people with talents and dreams from all around the world. Cutting off this source of intelligence and their contributions will the start of the fall of a great nation in history. Canada, Australia, U.K. and all those developed countries will absorb these talents if U.S. dont.
