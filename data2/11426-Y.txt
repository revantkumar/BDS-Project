I definitely support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should really let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S. The benefits will be obfious.

2. Diversity is something originates from US, which should be kept as it is recognized as a country.

Even though competitions do exist, it is not a nightmare. It helps people become better persons, and help the whole society to grow much faster.

Competition is not something that one should be afraid of. Everybody should have the courage to embrace competition. Don't be coward! 

Really looking forward to the changes this proposal bring about! REALLY!!
