I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and contribute what they have learned to the U.S.

2. Competition does exist, but is a good thing. Competition can help select the most talented people as well help benefit U.S.'s competition over the world.
