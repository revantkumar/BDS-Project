I'm an engineer. I worked at Google for a week and a half a few years ago. I was asked to sign the employment agreement, which said, among other things, that I had read the employee handbook. When I asked my HR rep for a copy of the employee handbook, she said there was no such document. Please see my attached document for the full story of what happened next. (I would paste it here but the document preview eliminates my newlines and makes a mess of the block quotations.) Daniel Wilkerson; daniel.wilkerson@gmail.com
