I support this proposed rule and hope soon this will become a real, declared one.

Students who come to the States are highly qualified as they have to compete with all brains in the world. After finishing the degree, they should have given the chance to settle down. They should be given the chance to find a same field job so that they can contribute.

The proposed system is a good one and will give students time to achieve some expertise. USA is going to be the most beneficial one.
