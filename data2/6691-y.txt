Yi Li I support this rule for the following reasons: 
1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to gain experiences. 
2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in Engineering area. Moreover, without this rule rule, only 1-year opt can only help the students find a job and be trained for several months, it is both a waste of time and money for american employee.
