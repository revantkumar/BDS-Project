I am writing to support the post-OPT extension. It is in the right direct to help the student to gain work experience as well as contribute to the economy.

I know it is difficult to find a job for the US citizens. But the international students are facing an even much harder situation when looking for a job. Only those excellent students can get an internship opportunity, which is actually good for the industry and the economy.

For the students, they can learn American culture better during the internship. They might bring American culture back to their country, which will also enhance the business tie with USA. Further, diversity is very important and those international students can help to think, to look at a problem from a different perspective. 

I sincerely wish the government to allow students with (or even without) STEM background to apply for the 24 months OPT extension. Thank you for your consideration.
