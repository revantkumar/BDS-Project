The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a strengthening force for the American tech industries, especially those ones that are falling behind the other counties' because of the recent economic difficulty. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been paying huge amount tuition to receive college education in U.S., and allow them the opportunity to actually find a training position as promised when they first decided to come to the U.S. The hardship of getting employed has not been eliminated yet, and the short period of original OPT period could not guarantee foreign students the opportunity they had the right to get. It was also too transient a time for the companies to find their right match of workers. Think about how many world-leading minds will then slip outside of the U.S. and go to other countries with more generous working policies.
