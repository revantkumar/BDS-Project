I strongly support this case.

Some others might argue that these foreign students steal their jobs away, which to me does not make too much sense. As far as I know, most of STEM students are very high educated and trained for job positions which are critical to ensure US companies stay competent enough in the global. Without these students, the shortage of these labors would make the operation cost of US companies high-rocketing, which will in turn hurt the overall domestic economic, and eventually make us lose job opportunities in the same way.

Even when we take a step back and imagine a world without STEM extension, those people, who are arguing their jobs are stolen away, are definitely not competent enough to fill the thirst of high-end labors. Because the realty is that these students are relieving the shortage of the high-end job positions and thus helping the whole country's economy keep booming. Without a health and strong economy, those naysayers would be jobless anyway.

Sometimes, it's really hard for people without secure to think reasonably. They are becoming insecure not because they are threaten by others (e.g. international students), but that they refuse to keep learning and flight to make themselves competitive in this world.
