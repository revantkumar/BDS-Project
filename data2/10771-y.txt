hui dong I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from US universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the US.
2. Diversity is very important for the US.
3. Competition does exist,but is not a bad thing. It helps US to select the best people for the position and helps to improve the power of the american company.
4. Extension will encourage more and more foreigner students to come to US university to further their study. It really contribute to the university and American economics. If foreigner students can stay longer, they will buy houses and cars. It is very beneficial to all industries.
