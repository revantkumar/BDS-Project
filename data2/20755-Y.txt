Many F-1 students with STEM degrees fill in niche positions in the American job market, which are left empty otherwise. The US economy needs STEM graduates to thrive in the technology industry. It would only be logical to allow non-resident alien STEM graduates to work in the US and provide an extension for their OPTs since students are not guaranteed a work visa immediately after graduation. It would only be fair for provide more time and chances to apply for a work visa to continue working in the US and build a career while boosting the economy and making the US a tech super giant that it is today. Thank you!
