Giving financial incentives to companies to hire foreign students over US Citizens is wrong on every level. My daughter and nephew are both recent college graduates with professional degrees and cannot find decent full-time jobs. I also know from personal experience how many of these foreign students only use their American education and employment opportunities against our country. In the 1980's I was a student at the University of South Florida in Tampa and there were a pair of Iranian engineering students in my dorm who hated America and Americans, yet they were getting financial assistance from the US Government. We asked them why they were in the US if they hated us so much and their response was, "The Quran teaches us to learn two languages; our own and that of our enemy". I have often wondered since then if they ended up becoming terrorists attacking the US. If the US continues with this boneheaded policy of giving advantages to foreign students over Americans, there is no doubt it will have negative effects on our country and the American People. Please start putting AMERICANS first for a change!
