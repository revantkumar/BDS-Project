Xin Zou This proposed rule is a powerful engine to boost America economy. 

Fistly, F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees are highly educated, they process different kinds of professional skills for doing basic work, which most local people not willing to do because the low salary and too much labor. However, as a student just come out of college, STEM students are eager to find a job to practice what they learned, and they just require not so fat-pay salary. 

Secondly, prolong OPT time can create more work opportunity for local people. American companies hire those students can have faster development because students usually work inn very high efficiency with basic job, increasing the research speed, shorten products' developing period, bring company fast profit, boosting bussiness so that they grow faster, which bring more job positions for labor market. Local people can always stay in company, but students must return their country after OPT expire. 

Last but not least, international students working longer in a local company could generate more new ideas and make more contribution to the development of society, what they done here can give this nation more benefit and chances to create more wealth, then we can take effort to reduce world poverty and bring all the people with happiness life. 

For the welfare of entire human being, please support this proposal.
