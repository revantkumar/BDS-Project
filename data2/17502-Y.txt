Dear Sir/Madam,

The knowledge obtained from the vaunted American education is incomplete without the practical experience associated with it. The STEM OPT is really needed for us to experience the American Dream. We come to this land for new beginnings and lots of hope, which can be fulfilled by training opportunities for STEM degrees.

Thanks and Regards,
Sankalp Jain
