I strongly SUPPORT this regulation.

The purpose of OPT extension is to improve and expand the training opportunities for F-1 students, NOT FOR ILLEGALS. 12-month OPT is not enough for U.S. technique companies and STEM students, because the projects/product development usually takes more than one year, 12-month OPT is not enough for STEM student's training purpose and U.S. company need workforce to ensure they lead the world.

OPT extension is NOT for technique companies to hire non-immigrant students to lower down the wages! They need STEM students, a major source of workforce! They need people to work for them, not to lower down the wage and make people leave. STEM crisis is true. According to "STEM Attrition: College Students Paths Into and Out of STEM Fields Statistical Analysis Report", A total of 48 percent of bachelors degree students and 69 percent of associates degree students who entered STEM fields between 2003 and 2009 had left these fields by spring 2009. Roughly one-half of these leavers switched their major to a non-STEM field, and the rest of them left STEM fields by exiting college before earning a degree or certificate.

OPT allows F-1 students to have gain some level of experience. For STEM students, after one year of training, they begin to continuously contribute to technique company and support U.S. technique companies leading the world. Students in STEM OPT extension can only do a STEM-related job, the regulation will only benefit STEM students and technique companies, not affecting jobs in other field.
