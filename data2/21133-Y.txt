This is a good move by the government. F-1 student will have better chance to contribute themselves to US with the 24-months OPT extension. With the different and diversity background, culture and strength, they can bolster US as a greater country. After graduation from US education system, the 24-months OPT extension provide the opportunity and window for F-1 students to be trained and work here. They can be invaluable asset for the country. Therefore, I fully support this decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months.
