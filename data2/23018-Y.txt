Strongly agree

1. attract more foreign students to the U.S who spend tens of billions dollars each year to study and live in the U.S which would stimulate the economy. Needless to say those other industries like education, many Americans can make lot of money for just renting houses to foreign students. In fact, it is partially because of these foreign students, colleges and universities have more budget for providing scholarship to U.S kids and cutting tuition fees for native residents. 

2. as the center of world high tech industry and to keep U.S's high tech leading position, U.S. needs to attract the most high tech talents around the world. Domestic talents are absolutely not enough. Deporting those students would not benefit job market, to the opposite, would result in a huge talent demand gap among U.S high tech companies and therefore do harm to U.S. economy. U.S. needs to attract more foreign talents who contribute wisdom to the U.S and make money for the U.S.

3. expanding opt time and not giving more H1b quota would in fact benefit U.S., since it's just like hiring temp high-tech workers to work for the U.S and pay tax for the U.S for 3 years, and they would not enjoy retirement and other benefit like U.S. citizen. Comparing the tolerance for illegal immigrants, it's shameful for the U.S. to be so mean for F.1 students
