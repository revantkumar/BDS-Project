Steve S I strongly agree with Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with required degrees. For those who are saying they would lost job, don't seek excuse for your incompetence! if you have the ability to do a good job, no one would ever take job opportunities away from you!
