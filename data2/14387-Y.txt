I strongly support. Firstly, America needs more higher-educated people to keep being most powerful country and longer OPT period allows that college students from around the world provides their knowledge. Secondly, long OPT period allows students transfer their knowledge into real world experience that can attract more students ousdier us come to study. It is good for US economy, especially for education industry. At last but not least, lower labor cost is not always be bad for a country. Some companies, for example IT companies in Bay Area, those OPT engineers, accountants,and operation analyst support them well.
