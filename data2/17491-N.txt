Our American students and young people have the highest unemployment rate in history, and, young black American citizens have the highest rate of unemployment ever recorded. You have more American families on government assistance than ever in our history; we must get financially responsible, and make the changes necessary to rectify this fact before we help anyone else or continue the debt spiral track we are on currently. If we cannot get our debt under control, we cannot help anyone else in the world. Please stop and think for a minute about what American citizens need first so we can be in a position to help others. 

The FOIA request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two disgusting facts about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand; 1. you are denying unemployed American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 while telling us everything is great, I can assure you it is not; we have the lowest labor participation rate in 30 years, Americans don't work we can help no one else help themselves. And, 2. the program removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds when everyone is now aware both programs are a financial disaster for our country and the programs were a big cost lie when they were started, just like ACA. We simply cannot afford to help everyone in the world without Americans getting back to work. 

I believe your hearts are in the right place, but the timing is not good for our country; I believe delaying and suspending all non-critical programs should be the rule. Until we have our debts paid and our unfunded liabilities fully funded with a balanced budget, suspending this program is in the best interest of our country, so we will be in a position again in the future to help more people from other countries. 

Thank you so much for the opportunity to voice my opposition.
