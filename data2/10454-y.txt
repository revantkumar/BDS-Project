Nimit Dave United States has and will be an ultimate destination for brains from all over the world. The government has designed the F-1 visa process in a brilliant way that it benefits the individual, companies, universities as well as the government. The students who travel from all over the world are here to gain knowledge from the best and allowing them to gain professional experience is a practical thought. International students pay high tuition and fees, bear high living expenses (compared to the countries they come from), and contribute to the economy by paying indirect and direct taxes. The degrees without professional experience won't add any value if they go back to their own country. Also, if the government puts a ban on students' working, the rate of students coming for higher studies would drop significantly affecting the companies and economy. And the main argument is, international students apply and get jobs based on their skill-set and knowledge. Any employer will hire an international only if they don't find a suitable citizen. This makes the ground fair for everyone. I find no issue in allowing international students to make a way for their dreams in a country which was formed by immigrants; and this is only for a period of 36 months on OPT. I hope the government takes the right decision based on all the factors which play out to contribute to the economy and well-being of its citizens.
