Vushuni Gupta I strongly support this rule of expanding the training opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant. I came to this country for study because of OPT and OPT extension which allows me to work for a certain period. I am currently on OPT extension now and quite fluent with my current work. We paid large amount of tuition to attend US universities. The tuition in US is one of the highest in the world. If the training time for internship is cancelled, the tuition I paid is not worth its value. The cancellation of OPT will create immediate hardship on both myself and the company I am working for. I got the EAD card with STEM extension a few months ago saying I am eligible to work till Jan 2017. If cancelled, the card is invalid and everything becomes a joke and I will become an illegal immigrant. Where is the country's credit in this case? Even though the rule has to be cancelled, we need sometime to prepare for the consequence and the cancellation should be effective after a while, at least allows the current OPT holders to complete their OPT extension. The later guys can take steps for other paths.
