Dear officers,

I am an international student graduated from University of Florida in 2014 and pursued a STEM degree. My major was cancer genetics and genomics. Now, I am doing postdoctoral training in MD Anderson cancer center using my OPT STEM extension. 

My OPT STEM extension was supposed to be valid until 01/2017. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security makes my OPT STEM extension be expired in 02/2016. 

I just started a project in studying glioblastoma, a terrible brain cancer, using genomic sequencing techniques. If I had to leave the US by 02/2016, I would leave my project half way done. This project is so important that it will give molecular insights into this deadly disease and may reveal potential therapeutic approaches. The study will potentially benefit thousands of cancer patients.

I am very happy to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. I definitely stands for this proposed rule. By extending the OPT STEM extension to 24 months, I can have enough time to finish the project. More importantly, MD Anderson cancer center will not waste its funding to leave a project half way done and the discoveries of this study will give new hope to many brain cancer patients.

With this comment, I strongly support implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.

Sincerely,

Ming Tang
