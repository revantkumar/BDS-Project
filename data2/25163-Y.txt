The longer Opt ext., the higher unemploy rate will be for US citizens and residents. More and more ppl gonna lose job or harder to get a job in STEM field. Less and less US citizens will study nor learn technology and science. Citizens will be lower and lower level in their career path. Life is getting more and more tough and worse for US citizens. US gonna be conquerored by foreigners. That's too terrible. 
No OPT Extantion Please!
