Danhua Yang I do support this proposal. OPT stem give a HUGE contribution to American academics. Without this stem period, international students are willing to choose other countries that provide stem extension stead of USA. Also, this rule won't hurt non-immigration workers. Residences get first priority in job market. Only when company can't find proper candidates, then company will chose international students.
