I strongly support the ruling. I think the OPT program is a good motivation for the US educational industry. I will help help the US to have high quality pool of potential immigrants. It would be a threat to the US if all the smart, US educated people go back to their own countries and fighe against the US. Also, there is really no threat to local US stem students, because there are way more stem jobs than the universities can supply. If the foreign students are driven home, the companies will only have to hire people from overseas to do the job.
