OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

Please stop this economic boycott of American workers and is sending American money out of economy into foreign hands.

This puts our country at risk further by allowing more foreigners into our country that could have alternative purposes against our national security.
