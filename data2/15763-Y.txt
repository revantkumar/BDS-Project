I strongly oppose this regulation. 

There are two reasons: 

Firstly, the students are not receiving "training" in this period really; they are hired as regular full time permanent employees in companies, the same as all of their American colleagues. If this is the truth, why still use the name "training"? To be honest, this so called "gap" is just used to cover the gap period until the students can receive their H1B visa. The real reason to extend it to 24 months is just to make sure the students can "survive" the H1B lottery (with multiple tries) and make sure they can get the quota. 

Secondly, lots of students are really not doing the "STEM" work they are supposed to do in their employment. For example, students with the major of "financial engineering" or "quantitative finance" are categorized as "STEM" majors and thus are given this 24 month "traning". However look at where they work? They work on the Wall Street as traders, financial analysts, quants etc, earning two three four times salary as average Americans. To consider them as "STEM" really made me laugh.
