Christian Solberg I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we need to keep the best and brightest minds in the US. We have an INCREDIBLE competitive advantage in the world economy in the US: the world's best talent wants to live and work here. By not allowing the best and brightest to stay here, we are shooting our economy and future prospects in the foot. As Lady Liberty would say, "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free," but maybe we should add, "give me your smart, your brightest, Your stars yearning to start companies and create jobs." Voting against this bill constitutes voting against America's economy and vibrancy.
