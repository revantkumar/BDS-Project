The US government should expand the visas to foreign students. I don't think offering the opportunities to the foreign students means threatening and reducing the jobs to the local persons. Because, most of the foreign students are in major of the stem degrees in which only a small part of students is the american students. When the foreign students have graduated, they can only find jobs according to their majors. Besides, when a company has hired the foreign students, it must prove that this job can't find an american to fit it. So how can they reduce the job opportunities of the local persons when the jobs they found are those that cannot hire the local persons. So instead of competing with the local people, the foreign students are helping american economy because they are doing jobs that most of the local american can't do.
The normal 12 month(regular) and the extension of 24 months are very reasonable. Normally, a regular project in a company requires more than a year to finish. With the extension time, the foreign students can finish the his work without shift it to the others which is quite annoying and time-wasting. The extension of the OPT is actually in the interests of american companies.
At last, I believe US is an-immigrant country. We should be welcome to the foreign students. Don't forget, even Albert Einstein is an immigrant to this country. If we are not welcome to these foreign students, we are turning away many talent young guys.
