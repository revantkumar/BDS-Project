Quit spending money !!!!! We do not need to fund anybody's degree!!! We paid for our family and everyone else can too. 
We made deep cuts in our budget, and so can others. We really had to cut back with both of us working, to send our boys to
college!!! Anyone wanting it bad enough can work for it. Let states and private business help, not the federal government. 
We need to worry about the federal debt budget, since December 11 is fast approaching!!! 
We need to stop regulating and spending unnecessarily!!!

Sincerely yours,
Marion A and Thomas Hill Conroe, TX
