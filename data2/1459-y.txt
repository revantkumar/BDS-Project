Zhen Yang For those international students who need OPT extension, they have already been working well in US for a year. For some of the international students, the education fees are quite high, but they still choose to come and study in US since they believe they have the ability to find jobs and achieve their dreams. It is really not fair to stop their career paths just after one year, and I believe all those students should definitely be encouraged to keep building their dreams and future. 

International students also have their friends and life after studying and working in US for years, some of my friends have studied in US even since high school. For the past few days, I can see a lot of Americans have already changed their attitudes towards this rule but they might not make comments on this website, and I still have to thank for their support and understanding.
