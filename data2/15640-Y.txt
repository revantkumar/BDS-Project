The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program would help grow our economy and create new jobs that benefit us all. Extended OPT would give F1 students more time to put their skills and talent to best use in American. Their skills and talent would complement native workers, allowing each group to specialize in areas where they hold what economists refer to as a comparative advantage. Specialization makes economies more efficient, and efficiency drives economic growth. 
This proposed rule would not only help grow the economy but also create more jobs. A 2008 report by the National Foundation for American Policy calculates that each high-skilled visa requested by a U.S. technology firm is associated with an increase of employment of five additional workers. (See http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-george-w-bush-institute/the-us-needs-more-immigra_b_1917220.html) Extension of OPT would provide us with more time to select the best of the best to work for us. The growth of the economy would create more jobs for us.
Some people think this rule would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes. I just cant agree with them. I mentioned above about the big picture for the country that this rule would help economy grow and create more jobs. Just thinking about how these F1 students live in our country, e.g. food, house, car, etc., these are all about business, job opportunities and of course taxes.
All in all, I totally support this proposed rule since it would benefit us all.
