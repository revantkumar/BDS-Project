Sharon Song In my opinion, everyone with the skill that helps the US in a positive way deserves an equal chance and treat. If they have been educated through our own educational system, earned the degrees successfully,learned the knowledge and skills that we need, and are willing to stay here and contribute to our own country, I can see no reason why we should let them go. America symbolizes freedom, democracy and opportunity. Don't let ignorance fool you. Do the right thing. It is either Nowwwwwwwwwwwww or never. Extend the OPT!!!Extend the OPT!!!Extend the OPT!!!
