Luke Skywalker I think a longer OPT can benefit U.S.

Since longer OPT does not mean higher H1B rate.

H1B still need ballot, and the number of H1B visa is unchanged.

That means, more tech talents can work for U.S. with their best time in life, and return to China while they are replaced by newer students.

That is great for U.S.
