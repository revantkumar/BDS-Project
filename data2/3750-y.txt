Mengdi Li In my opinion, the reason why USA is the most attracting country for those international students is the OPT and the cultural diversity. Sometimes, if one year is not enough for the international students gaining enough experiences, why don't we allow them to be trained for several other years? Some person would say, probably they could get those positions which should be occupied by USA residents. I am not sure about the other fields, but for the field what I am studying in, no matter how long an international students have already been trained, the USA resident could get a permanent position much easier than international student.

In my opinion, when a employer would decide if they are going to hire an international student, the most big issue they may worry is about the potential money they have to pay for the application of green card. Apparently, this policy is not related to green card application. It is only about OPT extension time. The above situation is about permanent position, for temporary position, why do USA job hunters need to worry about those positions? The temporary workers would have to leave once the positions are due. They would not affect anything for USA job hunters.

In conclusion, the extension for STEM OPT is only the allowing for those who need longer time to be trained in USA and would not affect any USA residents benefits, inversely, they would give more tax and they would make a lot of returns to USA residents and government. Why do we say no to this policy? There is no reason.
