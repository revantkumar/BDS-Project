I strongly support the new proposal for the following reasons:

1. This policy will attract more student all over the world to come to the universities of the US. This will bring the exceptional people all over the world to the United States, which will eventually be beneficial to our economy and technology.

2. As the proposal points out, the new extension policy only works for students within the STEM field. But only american citizens cannot meet the demand for professionals in these fields. Many of the international students works for important companies like the technology companies in the silicon valley. If their OPT extension is suspended, they have to leave US immediately after Feb. 2016. It is hard to estimate how much bad influence this will have on these companies.
