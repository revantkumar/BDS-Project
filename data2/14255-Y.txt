I support the proposal that we should let the student from other countries to contribute the US.

Firstly, if we let the students go, they would go back to there country taking the advanced technology to their own country, then the country itself will get more advanced technology. It's bad for US.

Secondly, US has been a country that the immigrant is very important to the country such as Albert Einstein. A lot of historical provement we can think of. Abanding this proposal is like closed the gate of the US.

We strongly support the proposal and that is very very important to US.
