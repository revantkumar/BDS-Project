John Gay I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1: The government has investigated huge amounts of money on graduated students with STEM degree.
It is important to keep them and let them contribute to our USA.

2. Graduated students with STEM degree can leverage lots of tech giants (Google Facebook).
These need them badly to make more profit and generate more TAX which can benefit all citizens.

3. Diversity is very very important to keep a country strong.
