Anonymous Chen One of the strengths of the US is advanced technology. Without attracting well qualified international students to the US, those tech companies can't fulfil positions with high skill requirements, which will be detrimental to the US economy and high tech development. Therefore, I fully support expanding training opportunities for international students with STEM degrees. It is a win-win win for both US and students. International students with good qualification will make tech market more competitive in a healthy way but not to make US citizens jobless.
