Jiajie Wu I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Immigration is the base of United States - the United States. United States is the country based on immigrants. Thinking about about 400 years ago, the pioneers, who came to north America, settled down here and established this country, are immigrants. They came to the U.S. to fight for a better life and finally they establish this country with their brave and hard work. Immigrants usually have stronger will to work harder and contribute more to the society because they do not get as much social benefits as citizens do. This also brings more benefit to the country because the U.S. could have more hard working and well educated people if STEM OPT extension came out.

2. The U.S. government should let students who learned high-end knowledge from U.S. university to have change to make contributions to this country instead of kicking them out of this country and using their knowledge to serve the competitor of the United States. This will let the U.S. become less competitive.

3. Competition in the job market does exist, but it's not a bad thing. Competition can help the U.S. and the job market to find suitable talents for those high technology STEM positions. As a result, it will improve everyone's knowledge base and skill set, including U.S. citizens and foreign students. Therefore, having this STEM OPT extension regulation can help the U.S. to keep having more and more well educated and skilled talents, so the U.S. can keep the leader position in STEM field in the world.
