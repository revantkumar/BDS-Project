Lucas Zhang I strongly support the extension. As one of those who aspires to start a tech business in US, the extension will provide enough time for the business to grow and hire local employees. Many of current US tech companies founders were not born in US and it is the policy of attracting young talent that benefits the US economy and make the US the leader of innovation among countries. There are a great many students with strong technical background who can potentially make a huge difference to the nation.
