I strongly recommend the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Stem will make US universities much more attractive to international students compared with other countries in the world. Take myself as an example, I had many choices of my graduate study a year ago, UK Singapore and US. But the main reason driving me to choose to pursue my degree in US is the so called 'STEM' program. It allows me putting the skills I learned from school into practice, which is a great benefit to my future career. Thus, stem will undoubtedly put US university in a great advantage in attracting international students all over the world. 

2. STEM will create great benefits and efficiencies to the US companies. Again take myself as an example. I had a chance to intern at a major investment bank on Wall Street in one of their quant finance groups. A great proportion of my colleagues and other interns are international students who will benefit from STEM program. The STEM program will undoubtedly enhance the diversity of the employees and their working efficiency to a great extent because imagine that in an environment where everyone knows that he/she will not work for a year, I don't think there is a good chemistry reaction in this team. The skills and techniques that students in the STEM program will not only put themselves in the right career path, but also will bring great benefits to US economies.

So in all, the STEM program is good for the students in the program, US education and US economy. I strongly recommend this proposal.
