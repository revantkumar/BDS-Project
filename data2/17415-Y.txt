I can see that there is currently a big push on to promote our children to pursue an education in the STEM field. This is doing our children a disservice. They will work very hard to obtain a degree in the STEM field and upon graduating will have a very difficult time finding a job....

In most Americans eyes this is a waste of American intelligence. I hope that our government would STOP working so diligently against everyday Americans and STOP giving out what is basically corporate welfare to the very rich and powerful corporations? 

Rest assured that many are concerned about this issue and are watching to see what your rationale in the decision-making is.
