Jeff Shaver I'm a manager from a local software company in Pittsburgh.Surprisingly, I find I may not be able to recruit some talented international graduates in the future. Here I come to vote for them.
They are contributing to our country in a way that not many native American can do.
If we let skilled folks go back to their homeland, that would be a great loss for us. My colleagues are smart.They can establish fantastic projects and products for our customers. If we can let them work here for one year after graduation, why not two more years? We need more talents to code the future.To be honest, more than half of our colleagues are not US citizen. Without them, we can't find enough employees.
