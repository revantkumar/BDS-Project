Improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Student with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 students is really really necessary and right decision to make! I am working as an engineer in US using my extension OPT right now due to my failure on the H1-b lottery early this year. The job here provides me perfect environment and opportunity to learn things and expand my professional career. I have only one more chance for the H1-b lottery on next year. If I failed on that, I will lose the eligible working status, even living status in US. I will be expelled out of US immediately. Or maybe my company will assign me back to my homeland or somewhere else. But I have friends here, I gained my degree here, I started my career here. All the unforgettable memory I had in US will be gone forever. I hope I can continue working and living here, cause I love this place, I love this country. If this 24-month extension OPT bill got passed, I will get one more chance to continue my dream here. That means a lot for me! So I totally support this bill, from the bottom of my heart!
