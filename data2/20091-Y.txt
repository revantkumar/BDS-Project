This extension should be supported for the following reasons:
1) The prolong OPT period will help skillful STEM foreign students find their jobs to contribute their professional knowledge to US industries;
2) Extending the OPT period is a friendly signal for whomever that are willing to commit themselves to science, technology, engineer and mathematics, the hope of utilizing their skills and knowledge become much bigger, motivating the talented and trained professionals to stay and do actual goods to the US society;
3) With much shorter OPT period, many more students have to leave the US and may never be able to return as a professional worker in their lifetime. Driving people with high skill and professional knowledge away is SHORT-SIGHTED, and that will ultimately hurt the US. Strategically, this is a bad move for the country.
4) Recruiting foreign employees may bring in competition. However, competition is what promotes the standard of workers in every industry, and that is BENEFICIAL to the country. On the other hand, foreign employees may not necessarily take over the local's job. Instead, new blood can boost the expansion of the industry and thus more jobs are created.
