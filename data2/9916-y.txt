Bo Zhi The 21st century is a great era based on the rapid-developing technology. So, as the cornerstones and pioneers of the science and technology, STEM students are necessary to the whole society. They have made and will continue to make great effort to promote the scientific and technological development, which means a lot to the whole nation. International students consist of the most STEM students, the majority of which have or are pursuing PhD and master degrees. Therefore, they are most close to the core of the cutting-edge technology. If they fail to find suitable positions after their graduation, it means the States will lose considerable intelligence resource. This will definitely impact the technology development and impair the economic recovery. Personally, I do not believe this is what the States wanna see. On the other hand, though the cancellation of OPT extension will provide more job opportunities to domestic students in the short term, but in the long run, such decision will backfire, resulting in the stagnation of development.
