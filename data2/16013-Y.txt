I support to pass the law that STEM Degrees can have a 24 months of extension for OPT.

1. STEM fields are never saturated, absorbing more foreign technicians are good for U.S economic and population diversity.

2. STEM employee who already worked for more than 1 year are ready to serve the field they have contributed for years, and are sufficient for that position, there is no reason to reject those people continue to serve.

3. There are already a significant amount of employee all over the U.S companies who are using the extension, once get aborted, a huge impact will have on those companies and those people who live in U.S for years and their family members. That's not a result we want to see.
