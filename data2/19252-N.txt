I oppose the move to expand the OPT programming granting foreigners not only greater access to jobs in America, but under terms that are more favorable than what our own citizens receive. No way should foreigners, at a lower cost than Americans, as the OPT program provides, get preferential treatment. Nor, should employers be able to nt pay payroll tax on foreign hires whereas Americans are subject to them and cost both th employer and the employee more. This s an I level playing field tilted to foreigners at the expense of our citizens.
