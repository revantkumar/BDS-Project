I strongly recommend that this OPT 24months should be put in practice.

If America has enough STEM workers, why do you get so many international students? Because of the lack of qualified Stem students and workers, America has to offer the opportunity for intellectuals around the globe to come here in the U.S..

On the other hand, it's not the case that foreign workers get the chances away from the domestics. The reality is that, the domestic people is not capable enough, and they are afraid of competition with foreign workers. We all know that, competition makes progress. If the U.S. is full of lazy workers, who are afraid of competition, how can U.S. be still there remaining as a great country?

The 24month OPT extension is vital to the U.S. and therefore should be passed.
