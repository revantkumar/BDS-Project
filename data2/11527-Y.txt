Turns out, I can potentially extend my current visa with some new US Immigration department proposals. But I need your help in making it happen! No this isn't a Like scam and I am not a Nigerian prince.

Currently, I am on a student visa that allows me to work for some months after I graduate. The new proposal adds 7 more months to that. This is more 7 more months where I get a chance to switch to a longer-term visa. The US immigration department is taking comments from the public about this proposal. If it's positive, this proposal becomes the new rule.

How can you help?
Submit a comment. You can do this on mobile and it takes about 10 minutes or less. (Yes, I timed it). You can do this even if you're not a US citizen/national/resident. Yes, even if you're not living in the US. And yes, they are bound by law to read through every comment, so it *does* matter. The last ruling they made, they frequently mention the number of comments they got (unique or otherwise).

How?
1. Go here for the complete proposal: https://www.federalregister.gov/a/2015-26395
2. Click on 'Submit a Formal Comment'
3. Write a comment. If you're too bored to type, here's my comment that you can copy-paste:
"I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness."
4. Enter your First and Last name and click Submit.
5. Thank you! :)
