We didn't see that there is a significant influence to the unemployment rate from OPT Extension. OPT extension is only for those high talented people, will not impact the basic and normal positions.
However, I do see the unemployment rate is decreasing these years, we can not cancel this policy by thinking this will make more people lose jobs. It will only bring more benefits for US.

Strongly Agree with this policy.
