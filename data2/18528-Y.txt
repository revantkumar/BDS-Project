Optional Practical Training has brought great benefits since it was published. Nowadays, Department of Homeland Security has decided to extend the OPT to 24 months which I think is a great decision.

First, the F-1 students that could have OPT extension are all in the high tech field, that is, STEM. As we know, US has a great demand of people with higher education and technology. They assure that US has enough working people in the market. Most of them work in the technological field which is important to the economy of US. If they cannot get the OPT extension, many of them have to leave US which could result in the lost of talented people and affect the economy of the US.

Secondly, OPT as an part of education makes the universities of US more competitive compared with universities of other countries. Many overseas students are more willing to come to the US for higher education because they can also get the opportunity to obtain practical experience besides taking classes. This also promotes the advance of tourism and airline industry.
