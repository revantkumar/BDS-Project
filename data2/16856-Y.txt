I am currently a PhD student at Texas A&M University. I strongly support this rule for the following reason: 1: It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skill after graduation. 2: We do not take jobs from Americans, Companies tend to hire internationals for high tech STEM relatated jobs simply for the fact that there are not enough qualified Americans available. As a result, to extend OPT period for F-1 student will only benefit American economy as well as it's status as world leader in technology. Cause you keep the best talents available (both Americans and Internationals) and they could use their talents to boost the American economy.
