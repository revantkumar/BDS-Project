Vikas Palakurthi I strongly support the extension rule of STEM OPT. No one can deny the fact that there is a shortage of highly skilled work force in some fields in the US. I am an international graduate student in computer science. 90% of the students I meet in the class are international students. Most of them are highly passionate about the field. The country can only benefit from the services of such students. People who are writing against the extension should realize that it is not the cheap labour that companies are looking for. Companies always try to employ highly skilled people. No organization would want to run with half-knowledge people just because they are available for a lesser salary;there will be too much at stake if they did so. The OPT extension gives the students a better chance of utilizing their skills in industry and thereby contributing towards the country's economy.
