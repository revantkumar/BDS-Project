The united stats has a obligation to support us citizens first giving employers incentives to hire and train us citizens would be a more productive approach. Most us citizens are opposed to allowing more foreign workers in the united states when so many US citizens are in need of training and employment. The OBT plan is out of touch with the belief of the American public and does not create jobs for the unemployed US Citizens in this country. The united States Government can use the resources for this ill-advised plan to help employ Us citizens and reduce the number of people on Government assistance. The US government needs to work for our on citizens before using our tax money on foreign workers more US citizens working will mean more tax collections for Federal / State/ Local also more people paying social security
