I strongly support this rule for the good of everyone staying at USA.
It is a benefit for US government to have more smart foreign people to work in the IT area at USA. About half of the IT employees are actually come from other countries, and they contribute to the whole IT industry which ranks as #1 in the world.
And it is American spirit to offer everyone the chance to work here. Talented students who come to USA for education deserve more time to practice their skills. Longer OPT will attract more students to come to USA.
