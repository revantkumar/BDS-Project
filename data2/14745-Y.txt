I totally support this rule for the following points:

(1) This rule will help the US to keep talented international students.
(2) The international students in STEM major learned the advanced knowledge in this great country, and also should have opportunity contribute back to this country with what they learned. 
(3) The IT industry needs STEM talent to keep ahead over the companies in other fast developing countries, like China and Indian. 
(4) The opportunity of international student to get H1B visa is continuously decreasing, as number of application is dramatically increasing year over year.
