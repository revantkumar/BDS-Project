KILL THE ICEB PROPOSED RULE, as it harms Americans.

The proposed rule from the DHS to expand the Optional Practical Training program would grievously harm American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. U.S. companies would hire foreign citizens with degrees for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers. As a result wages drop for workers.

The program basically pays employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or even the prevailing wage. IMMIGRATION POLICY SHOULD SERVE THE INTEREST OF AMERICAN WORKERS!
