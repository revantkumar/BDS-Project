David Rui The prosperity of the United States is highly related to its policy that allows for work opportunities for foreign talented people. In the past few decades, those people have made great contribution to the US and helped keep it the leading country in many fields such as economy, science and education. To maintain the competence of the US in the world, the government should keep or even improve this policy such that it is still a preferred place for those people with special skills to work in. As a foreign STEM student, I'm kind of disappointed with those who blame us for the jobless rate. Since the jobless rate is related to many factors and the bad economy plays an important role. The world is experiencing a decline of economy growth, it happens in almost every country including those in Europe and Asia. In order to eliminate this decline as soon as possible, the US still needs foreign skilled persons along with many talented US citizens to create more value. Another reason for the US to attract more foreign STEM workers is basically the lack of them. So it is not valid to say that foreign workers take away job opportunities of native-born Americans. It is not fair to refer us as "cheap workers" because the salary is based on the work itself. Nobody would do work only to get less paid than others. Besides, I don't think this policy would bring disparity between job opportunities of US citizen and foreigners. There are many restrictions imposed on us such as the length of OPT, chance of getting H1B visa and so on, which already make foreign workers inferior when hunting for jobs. We don't have those privileges citizens do have, so it is not true that we are threatening the chance of native job seekers. 
Again, the prosperity of the US could not be maintained without the contribution of foreign talented people. We hope the US still remain its liberty, equality and justice, and be open and attractive as it always is.
