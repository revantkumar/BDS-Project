Xunze Su I support improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrants Students with STEM Degree and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 students. My reasons are as follows:
1. Giving everyone an equal chance is the spirit that I learnt during the study I am doing right now. I can't believe why talented and resourceful international students are excluded from this spirit. We should be given enough time to practice what we have learnt in this free country after the graduation.
2. In this technology era with economic depression, STEM graduates will enormously boost the economy and change the depression situation these years. And the fact is that, international students takes up the highest percentage of STEM field. So we can actually help in this process, why exclude us?
3. Longer time STEM OPT will definitely attract more international students, which will bring the universities more profit. I don't see anything wrong with it, right?
