I agree with that extending OPT period of STEM F-1 students. 

As we know, United States of America is an immigration country in early history, even for now. It consists of kinds of people like Asian, European, Latin, African. It is the effort of all these people that contributes to the strongest country in the world - U.S. . Military, economy, technology and many aspects of United States of America are the first rank among all countries, I think that's why we possess the leading position. In my opinion, we should give the opportunities to F-1 students. On one hand, it is our tradition and culture to accept all the excellent human to our country. On the other hand, they can actually help our country to improve the competitive power, and make United States a better place for our citizens.
