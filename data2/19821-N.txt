Does anyone understand that our children coming out of college must compete against immigrants or whatever these people turn out to be - for jobs. Jobs are already difficult to get! Please stop this insanity. No more illegals! No more refugees! No more visa candidates! Stop this and employ our people! We should have no college graduates working retail! We should have full employment opportunities for the 70% increase in those that have dropped out of the work forces. These sham employment statistics are terrible and misleading. It does not reflect those that are working part time, under-employed and have dropped out of the work force. Please do not bring in more people to our country to take jobs from our own people. Please do not outsource to other countries either. It's about time we provide for ourselves instead of depend on other countries! One day we will be at war with one of these countries (say CHina) and what the Hell will we do!!!!
