Our jobs in America belong to legal American citizens, not illegals and not foreign workers. Tech companies and companies such as Disney, should be heavily fines for firing American workers and replacing them with foreigners. We have plenty of people in this country who need jobs. Companies such as Disney are actually making the soon to be fired employees train their replacements. Unfair and unjust. If these companies need more tech people, they can train Americans, not foreigners. Stop the assault on the American worker.
