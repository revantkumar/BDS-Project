I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S because they can translate what they have learned at university into competitive power and make America more stronger.

3. American is a country of diversity.
