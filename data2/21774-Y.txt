Yes, finally! It will definitely help! For research teams of a major corporation, getting only 12 month OPT period is disastrous. Since a lot of the project of my research group were involved into some research done by the universities and other institutions, and a lot of the F1 students played key role inside these researches which made them perfect candidates to continue these research project after graduation. But there has already been twice that some foreign researchers had to leave the country because they didn't get h1b visa and ran out of OPT period time. Such situation gave us no choices but look for replacements. As it took a long time to do it, both of the projects were delayed and caused more than a million dollars' lost to the company. Also, the replacements had far worse quality of the talent and capability in the research project which resulted in lower quality of the final product and termination of their employment. As a typical research life cycle will last 30 to 36 months, the new proposed rules will definitely fix, though not fully, this dilemma. I urge whoever leads the people in this country to pass this proposal and keep our country the leader in science and technology of the whole world!
