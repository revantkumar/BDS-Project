Mike Zhong I STRONGLY SUPPORT the 24-month extension of OPT. In my opinion, In many industries, especially the IT companies in Silicon Valley, there are many talented engineers and scientists, and most of them come from China and India. They have made great contributions to the development of American economy, science and technology, and certainly most of them are international students in US before they got success in their career. Diversity is very important in US, and the governments should let those students who learned knowledge in US and are willing to stay in US to have the opportunity to keep making contributions to the country.
I have to clarify that OPT is a period for F-1 students to have optical trainings or interns in order to complete their degrees, and it has nothing to do with illegal immigrants. Competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing. Those students working with OPT are not stealing jobs from Americans with much lower salaries, and that's mainly because for many technical positions, employers cannot easily find suitable American candidates, so they choose international students. In fact, there are many outstanding international students got employed in tech company and received salary much higher than the average. United States is a diversified country, and when those high quality students start their career, they will raise the average level of students in US, no matter you are native or international. Therefore, it will increase the global competitiveness of US.
