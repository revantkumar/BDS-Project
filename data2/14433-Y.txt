My point of view is from those who are international students and have a STEM degree. 
First of all, I don't think STEM students will take most of the American's jobs. When I was in school pursuing my MSEE degree, I have very few foreign classmates that are Americans. 2 out of 200 are Americans. The majority is the international students. 
Second, before I choose to come to US to have my master degree, one important reason is that my major, which is Electrical Engineering is one of the STEM degree and I can have 29-months opt period to get a full time job. US's tuition and fees is higher compared to other countries(eg. UK), because we need to afford 2 years tuition. However, when we consider that we can have better opportunities to work here, we choose here. Not to mention the statistic that how these large number of international students raised American's economics. 
Thirdly, the high-tech companies cannot find enough Americans to do their job. I think this is because Americans are not interested in these STEM majors. So companies in silicon valley can only hire those international graduates. Besides, those graduates usually have a good offer compared to most of the Americans. For example, the computer science graduate have at least 100k in industry, that is far above the average pay in US.
So improving and expanding OPT for F1 student is a good solution for both Americans and International people.
