I strongly support this new STEM OPT extension Rule. I am currently a geographic information science master student at Clark University, and was a GIS specialist intern at MassDEP. Firstly, the one of the main reasons why I chose to pursuit my master degree in US, rather than other countries, such as Canada, England, and etc, is US government provides the practical opportunity and the OPT extension for students like me who major in STEM fields. Without a doubt, if the new OPT rule is declined, the number of international students majoring in STEM fields will drop dramatically. Since there are other countries provided better policy and opportunities for those STEM students. If the OPT rule is declined, the high-tech companies like ESRI, Google will definitely suffer, not only because the loss of talents in STEM fields, but also having employees with international background is also important for company in the globalization era. Moreover, I do agree the extension of OPT. Based on my personal working experience in MassDEP, a project is usually last more than 2 years, such as the one I worked for 2016 Water Quality Assessment in MA. It is possible that if there is no extension of OPT, international workers will lose their working permission before the project is finished. Last but not least, I will definitely go back China where my family and friends live. The main reason why I want to work in US for a few years is I want to be more competitive since other of my friends who studies in China work better than me. Thanks for reading my comment.
