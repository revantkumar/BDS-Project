Jeanette Peng I strongly support this proposal to be approved!

1) In the history America is an immigrant country. Because of thousands of excellent immigrants came to the US to help build up this country and contribute their talent and effort, this country can be this powerful now. STEM -- the technology and science is the key to make great progress to our human society. There should be no boundary in science and technology. It's smart to attract the talent students to come to America and help them stay in the US to devote their techniques and ability to American companies and institutes.

2) Different cultures can help American to see and understand things in other angles. Diversity definitely helps Americans be more creative and efficient. 

3) It's a global economic world. If provide the STEM students longer time and more opportunity of training, in the future when they go back to their own countries, they will be better leaders and workers in their positions, which will benefit back American companies, they can help America build up better partners and rules in this global market.

4) STEM students will not take American's jobs, in contrast, it will help increase more jobs in the market, because the talent people help the companies make profits and expand. It can stimulate local American students to study harder and be more competitive.
