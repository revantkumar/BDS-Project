YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension.
1:
Many celebrities are immigrants, if the opt-extension has been canceled there will be a large number of talents come back to their countries because of less chance to have a job in USA. Not only does it mean a huge loss to America's economy, but also other field like science and technology, thus it can seriously impair America's status in the international world in the end. 

2:
The request to place the right of citizens over non-citizens is simply RIDICULOUS. Just remember, every citizen or their ancester once was an immigrant.

3:
As someone experienced in the tech industry, I can tell you with my reputation that the tech companies can never hire enough talents these days. Go ask the hiring managers and recruiters, they will tell you the same. Yes, USA probably has a lot of STEM people, but it simply does not have enough STEM talents. See, there is a distinction between normal people and talents. USA needs the talents from foreign workers to keep its machiens running well, and running better than the rest of the world..
