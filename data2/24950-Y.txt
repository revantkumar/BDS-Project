I totally support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant student with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.

U.S.A is well known for it's education quality and has a lot of great programs which make great contributions to establishing high academic reputations. OPT and OPT extension is one of those programs. The universities in USA embrace a diversity of students from all over the world, combining with OPT program, they attract a lot of foreign students to get higher education as well as training experience.

It's not deniable that the students from outside USA have made great contribution directly and indirectly to the local economy, culture and science and technology. With OPT program, students get more chance to collaborate with the best American scientists and help solving a variety of problems in industry across the nation.

Without OPT extension program, universities in USA may not be a sufficient attraction when compared to the other strong competitors such as best universities in British or Singapore. This would means a drastically drop of the best students coming to USA every year. Facing this situation, the companies will lose a lot of talents who should be able to work for them and make great contribution. Actually, I think the industries would get shocked by the cancelation of OPT extension and won't recover in several years. Since it is those talent people who build USA a great nation in the past decades.
