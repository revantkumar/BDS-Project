Sirs, I would encourage your group to rethink the application of this new regulation proposed by THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. Common sense should tell you that we are funding foreign workers at the expensed of our own unemployed American Citizens. A recent example of this is the Disney Group requiring American workers to train their replacement workers so American Citizen workers can receive termination benefits. This is an example of why American Citizens are becoming so angry over the direction that our government has gone under this administration.......Thank you.......Howard
