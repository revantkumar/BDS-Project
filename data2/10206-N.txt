Our school system in North Carolina has multiple programs for developing the basics from which United States citizens can start on the path to a STEM career. Various businesses in the community offer awards to high school teachers who are outstanding in teaching the basics of STEM to their students.

The Department of Homeland Security's proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. OPT causes the country to loose in two ways. First, it removes job opportunities for U.S. citizens with STEM training. The jobs lost may be either opportunities for new graduates or, has been reported in the newspaper and on TV, they may be jobs lost by U.S. citizens that are fired and then replaced by lower paid foreign OPT personnel. Secondly, we are spending valuable education dollars to train U.S. citizens that eventually can not find STEM jobs as they have been taken by foreigners.

I recommend that the OPT program be totally terminated, with the resulting savings taken from the Department of Homeland Security's budget and redistributed to school systems in the U.S. that are developing U.S. citizen STEM workers. This program is totally non-supportive of the basic security goals of the Department of Homeland Security.

I shall write my congressional representatives requesting them to see that all funding for OPT in Homeland Security's budget be defunded.
