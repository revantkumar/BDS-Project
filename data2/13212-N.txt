Hello,

This program is a bad idea. It takes steps to favor jobs away from US citizens and hands the jobs to illegal aliens. It is an outrage to pursue anti-American interests in this manner.

The Center for Immigration Studies shows that the OPT program that the Department of Homeland Security is now trying to expand has already denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013. Furthermore, OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. This shows the socialist redistribution of wealth already happening with this anti-American program.

It's time to restore American interests first. It's high time to restore American jobs for American citizens first. Favoring illegal immigrants only proves evidence of anti-American illegal behavior.
