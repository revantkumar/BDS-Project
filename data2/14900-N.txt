OPT is bad for American Citizens, American Workers, and American Taxpayers, and our children and grand children will pay the price.

Please do not take this action.

Please put Americans first.

We have millions of out of work citizens and students in college that will be looking for work, especially in STEM jobs.
A little more education and some government supported training and we can produce the best STEM workers in the world.

Let's not give these jobs away.

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
