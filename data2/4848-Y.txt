I strongly support this rule for those reasons:

1. International student spend large amount of money everyday while they stay in the US, more costumer means better economy.
2. The equality in this rule is the representation of American spirit, women and men who have served in military sacrifice and fight for it for a long time, do not dishonor their sacrifice.
3. Talented international students stay in the US could help the US to keep on top of other countries in terms of technology, science and economy.
