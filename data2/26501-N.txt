The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.
Not only that, the majority of these wages earned by these students is not spent here and does not help the local economy, most of the money goes back to their families in a foreign country only to help their local economy and not here in the states.
My son graduated two years ago and still has not been able to find a job in his profession. Why are we so concerned about helping foreigners when we do not help our own TAX PAYING AMERICAN CITIZENS get the jobs. These AMERICAN CITIZENS are the ones that generate the U.S.tax base that PAYS FOR YOUR JOB....you certainly do not pay my salary, the above foreign workers appear to have more representation in government than the CITIZEN ........WHERE are our true priorities going????????
