I would be so disappointed to see that such bill does not pass. The United States is world renowned for its equal opportunity and a country which is built on immigration. however, with the up rise of extremists, such trend has been continuously diminished. It is inarguablly true that the United States should allow more students, especially those who major in STEM, to stay in the United States for more time for their career opportunities. On the other hand, it is so disappointing to find the number of people who disagree with such actions based solely on concerns that this bill might cost their job. It is rather evident that the United States has long been a land of opportunity. Such policy and spirit should be remained rather than abolished.
