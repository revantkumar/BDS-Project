Technology innovation is a major driving force of the United States economy. Among the factors that lead to successful technology innovation, high quality nonimmigrant professionals play an indispensable role. However, current visa regulations are not friendly enough to support those nonimmigrants who devote to technology innovation and who are also willing to improve the economy of the United States. Some of the international students came to the US, took higher educational resources, but are forced to go back their home countries due to visa problems. Loosing those students not only waste the educational resources they received in the US, but also worsen the manpower shortage in the technology market. Extension of OPT in this proposal will definitely help the US retain those high quality professionals. It is also a necessary step in better immigration regulations that will help attract more and more professionals to the US.
