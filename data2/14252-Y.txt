This proposal is an extremely welcome development. The US needs highly skilled STEM students, who will in turn gain ample experience from working in US industries. This will offer a great opportunity to drive innovation, a much needed driver for boosting the US economy. Moreso, this poses absolutely no threat to skilled STEM US citizens as there is a deficit in US domestic labour supply for STEM jobs. Why train students here and send them back home?!
