I would really advocate this proposal to extend the Optional Practical Training period by 24 months or even more for STEM students. Every STEM student is capable of contributing to the growth of this wonderful country which we call as our home. Students from across the world flock in this country to get the best possible education on this planet and it would be really unfortunate that this great great country can not provide more than 12 months of OPT period for them. A 12 months of OPT period is insufficient for students to get H1B visa due to the staggering amount of applications received for 85K odd visas and it all becomes a lottery. The 24 months of extra OPT period would be a relief for all students in trying to get the appropriate working visa without having to leave this country. Any STEM student leaving this country due to lack of visa/OPT extension would be unfortunate as that symbolizes shutting the doors for next Google/Facebook/Dropbox/Uber/Quora like startup in this country and thus thousands of possible jobs would never become a reality. If this wonderful country can give opportunities to students from across the globe to study, I am sure this country can give those students enough working opportunities as well through OPT/working-visa/EAD. I am totally in favor of this proposal and can not thank more the president and everyone involved for putting this proposal on table.
