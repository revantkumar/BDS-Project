As a business onwner and entrepreneur I have found the STEM OPT program to be hugely beneficial in the development of our business.

My company, Practice Unite LLC, is based NJIT's Entrerpise Development Center. This allows us to employ studentts after they graduate. We have employed five graduates through the STEM OPT who make a critical contribution to our business.

Their conribution has helped grow our business and as a resul of this growth we have employed 10 other employees.

This program has been critical to our growth. By increasing the extension we will benefit from the skills and knowledge that these bright young people can contribute. Given that NJIT is a State University, it is a perfect example how a state funded institution fuels job contribution.

I strongly encourage you to increase the STEM OPT program.
