I strongly support the improving and expanding OPT for F1 students
1. A brief glance of the views that against the law is totally unreasonable and they are just object it blandly.
I agree there is hardworking Americans, like some of my colleagues. However, I have to say that among the students in STEM majors, American students takes really a very small portion. The work suit for the people who is good at it, but not for the people who is born in this place. For the sake of the development of this land, we need to absorb new energy and encourage the really good students to stay here and work for USA.
The job is open to every single person, not just for international students, but also for the American students. The requirement of the job determines who is at that position, but not the person where he/she was born.
2. One objected said: we cannot afford this, keep Americans working.
Just imagining, what will USA be if there is no foreigners working in American in STEM areas? There will be less people working on coding, engineering, etc... Will it be a disaster to USA? How could the economy grows? And let's look at the CEOs works for Google, Pepsi, and different Banks. Are they all born Americans?
3. It will do good to the education to have talent people works in STEM area if there is extension since it will attract more people here with great minds. They are also hope to be welcomed and join the brainstorm with Americans.
