Jinmei Xu I strongly SUPPORT OPT extension for the following reasons.

1. This brings plenty of working opportunities to the U.S. International students brings so much consuming, which is good to American economy.
2. International students are very brilliant, they must bring progress to the U.S. for many fields like technology, science. 
3. High technology companies need many STEM employees. U.S. citizens are totally not enough for that. If there are no international students, economy will get attacked deeply.
4. STEM job needs a relative long time for training. If there is only one year, companies spend time for them and then they have no chance to show the achievement from training. This is a huge loss of American companies.
5. If OPT does not have extension, there will be MUCH fewer international students. And universities won't have enough money for education construction. This will bring the decrease of education of U.S.
