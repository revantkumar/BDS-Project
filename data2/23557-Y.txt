I strongly support this new rule, which will come into play soon to benefit the US economy and therefore US society.

Firstly, nowadays, short OPT period and low H1b lottery spots stay as the very first concern when international students consider and apply for US colleges, including STEM majors. They worry about visa may jeopardize their long term career in US, even if they are of great capability and engagement to find a position and accomplish the tasks. The new rule of 24 months OPT extension to great extent ease their visa concern. US schools will benefit a lot because they stay internationally competitive to enroll more talents across the world. In such way, it also improves the transatlantic relationship between schools and research institutions.

Secondly, international students, especially STEM majors, come from top universities/schools/programs and pass difficult tests. They are of high standard. Their contribution to US companies is astronomic. This rule will definitely have them focusing on providing excellent service and products for US economy. That is one of the key factors that US technology companies stay competitive among tech giants all over the world.
