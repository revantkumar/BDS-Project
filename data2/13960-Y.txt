As a recent STEM PhD graduate, I fully support the 24 month extension. This rule would allow for more flexibility and greater development for my future career. It is important to note that foreign students on OPT (and extension) are NOT competing with US students for job opportunities, as there are strict guidelines and restrictions to what type of jobs OPT applicants can apply for. Instead, these students are filling job vacancies that domestic students cannot or do not want to take, and their contributions and efforts are likely to create more job opportunities for citizens and permanent residents.
