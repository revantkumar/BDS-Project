Tom Mysiewicz Firstly, many tech graduates in the U.S. have incurred substantial Federally-guaranteed student loans. By disemploying them with cheaper immigrant labor or by cutting their wages with low-end immigrants on visas, you could potentially shift the loss when the loans are unpaid to taxpayers. 

Note that education in countries like India is heavily subsidized and getting a Ph.D. can cost as little as $2000. I knew an Indian fellow running a motel in Southern Oregon who told me that was what his mathematics advanced degree cost. In the U.S. the cost can be 20-50 times higher. Is this fair to U.S. doctoral degree holders--to stab them in the back after having them overextend themselves?

I consider this proposal to be an attack on the American people. Half of 25 year olds are living with their parents and you want to flood the U.S. with tekkie immigrants? How about giving the corporations financial incentives to train these young people?

Finally, if competent EEs and others are absolutely unavailable, how about setting up an overseas subsidiary where they are? Companies have no problem doing this to shelter income from taxation.

Finally, the alleged protection of an attestation that no American worker is available is nonsense. Before my disability I worked in a field flooded with legal and illegal aliens. I wanted to work as did many of my fellow citizens, some of whom needed work. We were often overwhelmed with mobs of such Mexican and Asian workers who literally took the food out of our mouths--only leaving long enough to go home and collect monthly welfare checks in Seattle, Portland and Los Angeles. They drove fancy trucks while native Americans such as myself drove dilapidated vehicles that were barely running. INS and welfare authorities rarely took action and the companies insisted they needed the slave labor to survive. The U.S. Forest Service and BLM gladly showered illegal aliens with permits, allowing this unfair competition.
