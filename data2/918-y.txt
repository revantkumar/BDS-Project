Harry Stewart International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A.
