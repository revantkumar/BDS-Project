A Good Citizen Definitely should give the chance to the students. You ask me why? Cause they are helpful! Our system invests so much in their education, how about they work for us and pay back a little bit? I'm taking about tax, IP and all other stuff you can think of. Compared with the so called "undocumented" people who don't need to pay tax and in a few years can get citizenship for whole family and start to get all kinds of allowance and $$$ from the government, I don't see any wrong in this policy with the college kids. For those are against this, either you don't like all immigrants and don't believe in the foundation of this country, or you are simply racist that too dumb to understand what you are doing.
