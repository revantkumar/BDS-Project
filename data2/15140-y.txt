Yunya Chen Most FOREIGN STUDENTS STUDY HARDER AND WORKING HARDER than local students!! In my graduate program( which is applied math ), foreign students has higher graduate standard that local students, they do home work and group project better than local students. Also foreign students get better grades.
So if they have more opportunities, THEY WILL MAKE SIGINIFICANT CONTRIBUTATION to the U.S.
