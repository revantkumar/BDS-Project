I strongly SUPPORT this proposal with the following reasons:

1. U.S. is famous as his high technology and lots of people are using these technology to change the whole world. The reason why lots of international student come to US to study not only because the benefit they can get but we can get the best education and environment to learn knowledge. The responsibility to improve the whole world is for both the US citizen and international student.

2. Nowadays, the biggest Internet or technology company are consist of international people. If they do not have enough time OPT to get the authority continue work in US, they must leave. You can imagine that if most of them leave, the technology will not continue moving, no new technology will be published.

3. US is a immigration country. Not all the US citizens' parents or grandparents are born in US. People should have equal chance to choose their lives. So Cancel the STEM OPT is not fair for the students nowadays.

That is all my idea. Thanks very much!
