I strongly agree with this proposal. Most of the international students in STEM are among the best ones in their original country. They come here studying and hope to make contribution to science in America, the best platform in the world. This proposal will help USA attract the most intelligent head in the world to benefit the economy, which will finally creat many work positions in this country.
