I absolutely support this new change (that should have already happened) for increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension period to 24 months instead of 17 odd months. This will increase practical training and give students a certainty after their degree programs are completed. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness.
