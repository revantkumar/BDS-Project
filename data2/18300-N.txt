The United States Government should be focusing more on helping ACTUAL American workers to obtain jobs than illegal aliens or foreign nationals. This proposed policy on the increase of foreign students who will be hired as STEM workers defeats just such a purpose. It goes along with the entire trend and policy-making attitude of the Federal Government, including various leaders of both parties in which there is a constant push for amnesty, a need to drive up the legal immigration numbers, and a lack of enforcement for those who are here breaking the law and taking up employment for cheaper wages than the average American deserves. All this will do is continue to snatch potential employment from the hands of LEGITIMATE US workers and give them to foreign nationals who will work cheaper wages and keep skilled US students who need legitimate employment sitting on the sidelines.
