Xu Dai I strongly support this rule.

1. Everyone is born equal. International students try hard to overcome all the difficulties to finish studying in the US. If they are good at what they study, they deserve equal chances to get jobs in USA.

2. In business, companies do know what are the best decisions for profits and thus for US economy. It's the right choice for government to leave the decision of whether to hire international students or not to companies. International students only ask for a fair competition. Letting market to choose is the best way for US economy.

3. Extending OPT will attract more talented students to study in USA, which is good for education.

4. Right now, there are many employees in USA in OPT status. If this rule is suspended, there will certainly be a huge impact on US economy.
