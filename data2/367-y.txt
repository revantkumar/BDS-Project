Yifan Liu I support this new rule for the following reasons 
1.With the extended OPT, universities in US will attract more talented students to come and study. This will also bring more funding to these universities as generally foreign students pay higher tuition.
2.STEM graduates were equipped with skills that are needed in Hi-Tech industries, which is critical for the US to keep its leading position in the world.
3.STEM graduates will bring more employments to the US. Many of them will start their own businesses in the US. In addition to that, as more students are coming, more employment opportunities for the US citizens will be provided to support the accommodation, transportation, and entertainment of these students. 
4.While STEM graduates bring their own cultures to the US, they will also bring US culture to their own countries. The longer they stay in the US, the deeper this culture communication will develop and the more people in the US and people in other countries will understand each other.
5.Due to the culture communication, US will have better diplomatic relations with other countries.
In conclusion, this new rule will greatly benefit the US.
