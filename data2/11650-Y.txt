I do support this extension. 
Talented students should get more opportunities in US. This is not only good for these foreign students, but also good for US society. A country without competition will fall back in the future. Open-minded and tolerance are good virtues that help U.S. win its high international status. Please don't stop its development just because you want your kids to be well protected and then lose competition and finally becomes a loser. 
This opportunity gives international students more time to have better experience in the most industrialized country.This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both the F-1 non-immigrant students and the U.S. technology companies. Without this rule, the 1-year OPT can only guarantee students to work for U.S. companies for one year. Companies usually spend a few months in training a new employee and have to find a replacement in year. With this new rule, companies can hire an F-1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years which definitely will benefit production.
