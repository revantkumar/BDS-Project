Cody M. Slayden I strongly support the new Proposal 'improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant student with STEM degree and Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 student. 

The new proposal will bring several benefits to USA. 

1. It will help USA attract more and more intelligent international students. It is known that international students are now big part of university and play an important role. They have contributed to a lot to the development of many fields such as fundamental science and engineering such as computer engineering. 

2. It will increase the income of both government and university. As we know, tuition of international students is much higher than USA citizen students. The tuition that international students pay is major income part of university. With the money, university can provide better eduction hardware to student, can hire better professor and teacher to improve education software. The USA citizen students can also benefit from the improvement of education hardware and software. 

3. It will help USA become more and more competitive. It is true that international students may increase the competition of job market. However, competition would result in better technology. The competition will make both international students and USA citizen students spread no effort to do job better, which is good thing for the countries overall.
