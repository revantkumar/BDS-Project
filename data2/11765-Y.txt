I believe this rule will benefit both US citizens and foreign students in US. 
Firstly, most of the training and research available in US require more than 1 year to complete, especially in STEM fields. As these projects and researches will significantly benefit the society, for example new technology that can create a new job market, it will be necessary to allow more students in STEM fields to complete their training and research projects. 
In addition, as the rule will attract more students coming to US to pursue a degree, Universities and local citizens will benefits from tuition and house rental. And local restaurants will also get a lot of benefits from students. And it will also increase the restaurants diversity, which would improve the quality of life for citizens.
