As a PhD in chemistry from Iowa State University, I strongly support this new OPT extension rule due to the following reasons.

First and foremost, USA, which is an immigrant country, is ought to provide opportunity to those people with STEM degree and desire to contribute to this country. There is no doubt that the immigrants served and helped US a lot throughout the US history.Nowadays, thousands of STEM talents with different background are working in Silicon Valley, Walls street, national lab, with their expertise. Imagine that the OPT extension could not work, it will impact a large number of international talents negatively. As a consequence, the economy of USA will be influenced as well. From the viewpoint of economy, it is not a good idea to fail the new OPT extension.

Secondly, the new OPT extension will trigger more and more talents all over the world to USA, study and work, contributing this country. The new OPT extension is a positive signal to every immigrants that US welcome the people who are willing to serve, help and improve this country. This policy may not be a big issue, but its impact is huge since it represents the attitude of US to the immigrant talents, particularly to the STEM talents.

Lastly, OPT extension provide mutual benefits to STEM talents and US people. US will attract more students and this will definitely benefit the local economy and tourism. On the other hand, the STEM talent can gain work experience in US and become more competitive after returning to their homeland. 

In summary, the OPT extension provide a very positive signal to the talents and benefit US people and the STEM talents at the same time. I believe USA government will make the right choice.
