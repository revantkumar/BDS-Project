Siddarth Sunil STEM OPT extension will benefit both the employers and the students. Many students who graduated from American universities didn't get H1B visa due to high number of applications. 

This extension will gain traction of foreign students to get master degrees from United States. 

Revoking the STEM extension will have high economic impact. Employers will lose skilled employees and it will reduce the incoming applications for graduate education.

Future of the student shouldn't be based on lottery pick. Students graduated from American universities deserves a second chance. 

I strongly feel that STEM extension has to be increased to 24 months so that students get 2 more chances for H1B
