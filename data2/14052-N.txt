This is my "vote" against the extension of the OPT program - allowing foreign students the ability to remain for 36 months as employees & non-taxpayers. WHY? They're educated. They're making money. Why not pay taxes on it like all Americans have to. Certainly, the employing companies should NOT be exempt from paying taxes.
I regret that George H W initiated this program in the first place. My Dad immigrated from Germany after WW1, & he did it through legal means. Things were different then, & today's foreign students have a wonderful opportunity to study here.
BUT - they either have to leave as they agreed to upon completion OR - we could have a special program, again signed by them & their employer, that they stay or one year ONLY & the employer, at least, pays taxes on them. IF the company wants to hire them after that, there must be a legal means by which they return home & can return under different guidelines for full time residence & employment. NO MORE EASY ENTRY & JOBS! AMERICA is s prized goal & destination - lets' not keep giving it away because of some idealistic nonsense about giving everyone free access.
Let's go back & modify the original law, through Congress, & correct this unfair situation.
