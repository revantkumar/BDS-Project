Victor Fan I'm currently a asian senior computer science student at university of Michigan and I will join Facebook as a full-time employ. So the policy of STEM opt extension influences my life and career design greatly. Hundreds of the students share the same situation with me; we want to realize our "American dream" here and make a real difference. From U.S viewpoint, having stem talents will be a great bonus to American's economy and a boost for stability of U.S society.
