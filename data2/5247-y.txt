Pat Soranno Enough is enough! I am tired of seeing foreign workers given priority over Americans. And I am tired of seeing the quality of education being dumbed down to accommodate children who can not speak English. We owe the world nothing,but the USA does owe it's citizens the right to a good education and jobs. Stop the flow of these foreign workers and give the jobs to Americans.
