I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..they have better oppotunities to come anywhere,this talent should be valued every,instead of preveting them from making contributions

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S..,for instance, a lot of students contribute giant work to the u.s. numerous students creat a obvious wealth for the whole american society. there is no doubt that international students become one of the most important source of the contributions to the u.s
3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing.we should realize that today if you want to develop faster and longer, you should have enough benefits for these people who own various and outstanding skills, they could help to creat more jobs and oppotunities for american people. if we stop them from the gate. the u.s would not have even a competition compared with other countries.
