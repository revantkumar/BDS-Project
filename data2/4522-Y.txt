I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Here are reasons:

First of all, as international students have learned knowledge from US universities, it is desirable to use their knowledge and expertise to contribute back. Meanwhile, the experience from OPT extension will also help international students to improve their skills.

Second, with the help of OPT extension, international student in the STEM fields will engage to the development of high-tech. However, it should not be considered as competition with domestic workers. Actually it will help companies to expand much faster with talent people not restricted by their background, and more job opportunities will be available. For example, the recent development of IT industry, such as Facebook and Google, they need talented people from all over the world in order to face the challenge from the world. For other domain, such as Science, the barrier created by country boundaries shall be removed, where the OPT extension can be the first step to alleviate the gap.
