I strongly SUPPORT this proposal because of the following reasons:

1. The government should let students who study in U.S universities to stay and continue to contribute themselves to US. 
2. Many international students have outstanding academic background and high rank in their schools. If they can stay in US, they will benefit many industries, especially IT area. 
3. Even though there will be a certain competition, however a good competition can motivate all students including native Americans to devote themselves to what they are focusing on.(work) It is not a bad thing.
4. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. People who work hard deserve more time to practice their skills after graduation. 
5. Longer OPT time will attract more talented students to come to US to contribute themselves.

Overall, the advantages of this proposal far outweigh its disadvantages.
