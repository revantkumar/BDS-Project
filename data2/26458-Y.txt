I always think that the success of America is not contributed only by American. There are so many people from all over the world working on this land and create so much value to the society. The most competitiveness of America is the people. These people have different cultural background and different strength in the industry. I can't imagine an America without the help of people from all over the world. America is an immigration country but now why it has become so conservative?
