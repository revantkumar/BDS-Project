Chen Liang Every year, many low knowledge people from everywhere came to America to start they new life. They running cheap restaurant, cheap construction company, doing some landscaping....If America can give them a chance to stay in America, why don't give the talent people a better choice of living? Talent people are able to bring high technologies, better behavior, more money and more profit to America. It is a good opportunity for America having those people first. Don't let talent people back to their country, let them stay, America need them.
