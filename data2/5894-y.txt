Vivien Zhang I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. The key reason for U.S to be the strongest country in the world now is that its diversity and immigrants from the establishment of U.S. So U.S. shoule preserve and support this important values.
3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. it can help the growth of American economies and improve American people's life in the long term. And many international students do not compete with native Americans but with themselves. In many cases international students and native Americans have different career objects. There is no such thing like international students rob jobs from native Americans.
