The Center for Immigration Studies has noted:
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
The concern is for American Students having opportunities for these positions.
The foreign students should be encouraged to return to their home country to assist with the students new acquired skills.

A 2013 study from Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.

Let's support our students as they enter the IT Field.
