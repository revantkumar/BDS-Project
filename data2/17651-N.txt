With millions of qualified American workers unable to find jobs in their field. I greatly oppose any rule changes to the 
F-1 program which gives foreign workers preference. Increases of OPT to 3 years also will extend visa limits allowing students 
to take American jobs and remain after finishing their degrees. Please do not reward employers by eliminating payroll taxes of 
7.65 percent, encouraging them to hire foreign workers over qualified American workers. With over 12 million unemployed or 
under employed American workers we must take a stance of "American Workers First"
