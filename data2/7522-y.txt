Frank Yu This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both the F-1 non-immigrant students and the U.S. technology companies. Without this rule, the 1-year OPT can only guarantee students to work for U.S. companies for one year. Companies usually spend a few months in training a new employee and have to find a replacement in year. With this new rule, companies can hire an F-1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years which definitely will benefit production. With a healthy competition, it will allow companies to find more talented people and encourage more students to choose STEM majors. In long term this could help the development in science and technology. Also many STEM students already working in related industries will have to leave US if the extension got cancelled. It will cause some financial losses for many companies.
