I strongly support the OPT extension rule.

International students make great contribution to American's education. International students and their families 
contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, For every 7 international students enrolled, 3 U.S. jobs are created or supported by spending occurring in the following sectors: higher education, accommodation, dining, retail, transportation, telecommunications, and health insurance. according to 2014 NAFSA findings. OPT is the most important reason why so many international students choose USA to continue their study. Without international students, who build bridges between the United States and other countries? Who bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs? Who support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework, making it possible for U.S. colleges and universities to offer these courses to U.S. students ? Who support programming and services on campus for all students by paying out-of-state tuition? 

Without OPT extension I believe more and more international students will turn to other opportunities. If Universities/colleges do not have enough money, They can not afford research and developing new technology. Not only education but also the science and technology in USA will retreat. If USA want to keep the big country position in the world, she needs to attract more and more talented students from all over the world.
