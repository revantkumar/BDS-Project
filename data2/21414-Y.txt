Support the regulation. The reasons are following.

In recent years, information technology industry is one of the most active area in the market. However, in the university, over one half of the students who studies related major, most of them are STEM majors, are international students. These students are potential skilled works in the IT industry. If those students do not have a chance to work in the US, there would be a huge shortage of skilled works in IT industry. Because currently the leader companies, such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, are hiring large number of international students with OPT working permit. If there's no way for the international students to make an OPT extension, after their working permit is expired, those companies would lose many employees. And this is likely to have negative impact on the industry in short term, and even have some negative impact on the US economy. 
If it's difficult for a international STEM student to find a job after the graduation, a lot of STEM program will become less attractive to international students and they are likely trends not to apply a US STEM program. However, as the statistic data shows, NONE OF THE STEM MAJORS IS THE MOST POPULAR MAJOR IN THE US. IF THERE'S NO WAY FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TO HAVE A CHANCE TO WORK, THERE WOULD BE A HUGE DECREASE OF THE NUMBER OF STEM STUDENTS. So in long term, disallowing STEM student to work in the US would have long term negative impact in IT industry and US economy. 
Since most of the job position occupied by STEM students require professional skills, and they are only allowed to take the working position that is related to the professional skills they gained from the university (and the STEM major is not the popular major in the US). That means STEM STUDENTS ARE NOT LIKELY THE CAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY FOR SOME CITIZEN TO FIND A JOB. EVEN THERE IS NO INTERNATIONAL STUDENT COMPANIES WON'T HIRE SOMEONE WITHOUT ANY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE. As the result, the regula
