I strongly support this extension proposed rule.
First, the foreign student is a large part of US university education. If the long training opportunities are canceled. It will make US to be less attractive to foreign students, which will make a negative influence on US education industry and economics.
Secondly, talented people with STEM degree bring creativity to the US tech companies and help US to be a largest tech center in the world. If extension is cancelled, large companies will lose many talented people. Long training opportunities are important to help those talented students stay in the US and help US.
Thirdly, foreign students pay income taxes and absolutely contribute the US society. And I don't think they will take job opportunities from US students, since most of HRs of high tech companies know it is difficult to hire a talented STEM students, and US has a high demand of tech talented students. It will accelerate the creativity and the competition will help US students to study hard and have better skills, even for world wide horizon.
The diversity helps people to grow, and people will not study and work hard without competition. The only thing we need to take care of is the level of the rule, I think 24 months extension is an adequate level and help US company to find their talented employee.
