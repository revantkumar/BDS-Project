I totally support the new proposal of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe the timely implementation of this proposed rule to increase the duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. I also believe that this is also extremely important to maintain the United States' economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness in today's world.
