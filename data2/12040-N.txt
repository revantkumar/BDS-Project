American Jobs and education 1st!. Everything is wrong with this program. We are in an economic crisis here in the U.S. We are at war with extremism. Our national Security has been severely abused. Our tax dollars have been misused to aid foreigners, while leaving hundreds of millions of Americans unemployed without any consideration of their opportunities and futures. Their is NO justification for programs like these that preexisted when our country could afford to support them. Their is no excuse for actions taken by the president to go above and beyond congress or to continue to wring out the last drops of American taxpayer blood to do so, when our own have sunk into poverty. Taxpayers have had about enough of this! I want my tax dollars to go to America and for Americans 1st. We should be educating our own. This is a blatant slap in the face to the legal people of this country and the congress that is supposed to be serving them. Work programs provide permanency, as it has done in the past by those that don't return and stay fugitives within our borders. How do you think this country became invaded by millions of illegal fugitives in the first place? Idiocy on behalf of the president and a congress that has allowed this country to be trod on by a racially discriminatory administration, will cost you your seats. No Expansion! Temporary termination of all these programs should STOP until the United States is able to move in a positive direction and strengthen our economy, put our own people back to work and provide educational opportunities to our own generations of children and young adults.
