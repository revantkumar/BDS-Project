I am totally agree with this policy, those international students are really really clever, their emergence ease our burden, I can't even imagine what this country will happen without their help. As we all know, many distinguished men are from all over the world, the U.S. is an inclusive country, we shouldn't shut our door and prevent people from other countries from stepping into our country. To view from the perspective as a U.S. citizen, I should say it is a great benefit to extend the OPT for STEM students.
