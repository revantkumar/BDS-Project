Extension for F-1 students is necessary for the following reasons.

First, America is a nation built by people from different parts of the world. They have devoted their wisdom and knowledge from their own cultures In another word, multi-culture makes America great. If the U.S. government prohibits F-1 students chance, the government is actually betraying America sprite, because it's refusing diversity.

Some Americans friends complain that F-1 students are taking their positions away. I strongly disagree with such point. First of all, no one could deny that native people have great advantages over International students. Thus, the F-1s only grad a small portion of positions, and, meanwhile, the rest who is admitted by American companies are elites who can create great values for the society. 

Second, among those who find job during their OPT period, most of them get back to their countries after expiration, which returns jobs to American people. Why don't the government take the advantages of the high quality workforce? Why don't they extend the OPT time period so that the society can receive longer and more continuous contribution from F-1 students.

Lastly, overprotection upon job seeking makes American graduates less competitive. Refusing International students' contribution, meanwhile putting less competitive native students into positions makes U.S. society decline. Why not add competition in order to make Americans more competitive?
