Haoti Zhong To anyone who concern:

Today's world is quite open, and full of competition and opportunity, especially in internet technology field. As we know silicon valley is famous for it's numerous high-tech companies, which represent the innovation and leadership of technology of United States, also we know in this companies there are top level engineers came from all over the world. It is hard to imagine how the silicon valley will be without them. Today's opt policy is already very strict, a large portion of smart people, who already got their job and was making their contribution, have to quit their job and leave the country, but when I heard yesterday that some people want this policy even more strict, I was shocked, if even the limited freedom of work right is not guaranteed what freedom could we believen.
