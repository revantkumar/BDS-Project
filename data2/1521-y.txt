Yunfan Tang The current prosperity of the IT industry in the U.S. receives a large contribution from the international students community. I'm not saying the U.S. students are incapable in science and technology fields - there are a few of them that are very brilliant (for example they created Silicone Valley start-ups that change the way we live). It's just that there aren't enough of them. Every single fortune 500 company needs tremendous amount of science and technology workers to build and maintain their technology infrastructure. I've been through the interview process of a major financial service company for a research position and seen the peers. The vast majority of them are international students. Those are the people who are competitive enough to pass all the tortuous tests, and who wish to contribute to the success of the company and the entire country. 

Cancellation of the F1 OPT extension and therefore sending of highly skilled workers back home would be a suicide to the country's competitiveness. Science and technology is nothing like bakery. It takes tens of years to receive adequate training, and there is a huge difference between good and bad workers. 

The reason that U.S. could quickly become the leader in science after the second world war was its willingness to absorb prominent German refugee scientists. And now history is repeating itself again. I strongly support the F1 OPT 24 month extension for the future of both this country and all of the hardworking international students.
