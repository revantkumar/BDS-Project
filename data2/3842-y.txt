Grace Kauffman I support OPT extension absolutely.
I work with many international students because most of my friends don't like study in engineering fields.
We all know that engineering majors needs hardworking, and I have to admit that most Americans don't enjoy delicate formulas and inference. For example, in my company, HR has to hire international students because there are few citizens candidates in the job marketing. In fact, companies prefer citizen candidates because companies don't need to pay for sponsorship for international students. But the truth is that the unemployed are not with an engineering education background. They were laid off not because international students took their jobs. They are laid off because the fields they work in do not have good performance. Many of my colleagues will be affected if OPT extension fails. And it means that our company can not operate if those colleagues have to return their homelands. Without doubt, out company is not the only one that will be affected by OPT extension. So, I don't think OPT extension failure will be a good sign for USA economy. Bad economy will cause more unemployment. 
In this case, I support OPT extension.
