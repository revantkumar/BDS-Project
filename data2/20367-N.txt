It wrong to let so many foreign student come in and take the jobs away from our students. They spend years and millions of dollars to be STEM workers and to fulfilled other jobs.

By allowing this to happen it is a slap in the face to all Americans, who are trying to live the So Called American Dream.

It seems more important to take care of people of other countries then it is to take care of our own people.
