As a US citizen, I absolutely support the policy. Diversity is a very important for the U.S.. A lot of innovative technologies were created by immigrants who were international students studying in the U.S.. Many countries are trying to attract these students going back to serve their countries. It is not wise that U.S. paid a lot for these international students to become high educated and then push them away.
