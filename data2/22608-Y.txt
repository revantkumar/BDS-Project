I think the extension of OPT will make a beneficial effect on industrial manufactures, high technological companies and other enterprises, and this will help the economy to grow faster and healthier!

According to my own experience and information got from other manager or higher level persons, there are a large number of foreign people working in the industrial manufacturers and high technological companies. Among different departments of these types of companies, research and development is the department where many foreign people work in. Research and development plays an extremely important role in improving the core technology and competency of the company, and this matches the innovative development culture of the US. 

What will happen if the OPT cannot extended? People can only work for the company for 12 month, and that is generally when he/she becomes familiar with the business and system of the company. From the perspective of company, they train people to get adapt to the company and can do a good job effectively, but the employee cannot continue to contribute because of the expired OPT. The company will train another one and use another 12 month. There are a huge amount of companies in the US, and we can imagine how large is the time and funding spent on this nationally. 

In summary, the extension of OPT will not only make companies hire more fitting employees for longer term, but also reduce the loss of time and money on training entry level graduates. The economy of the US cannot become stable and even improved without the most efficient time and money consumption.
