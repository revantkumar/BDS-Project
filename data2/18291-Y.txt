This proposed rule is a win-win opportunity for both employers and F1 students. From I what I have experienced, one year OPT can barely give the company which hires a fresh out of grad school STEM student any benefit. The student learns something very superficial about the work then leaves. As a consequence, a lot of resource is wasted and neither the company nor the student gets what they want. 3 year OPT gives the student a chance to really make contribution to the company.
