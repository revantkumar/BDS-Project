It is extremely shortsighted to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation.
International students have made significant contributions to the United States in the past years. Moreover, we should notice that those students do jobs usually in specific areas (such as engineering and computer science) that most native Americans do not like and is not able to do. As a matter of fact, instead of depriving jobs of Americans, international students suffer low status jobs and actually thrive the American economics by their efforts, with the quick development of technology industries these years.
