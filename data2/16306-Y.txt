Most of international graduate students still cannot find a full time job and even they did so, the 27.3% H1B lottery for the undergraduates will still send them back to their counties after lost it. The OPT extension is the last straw for all the international students. Please think in thier position and they will definitely create more values and innovations than today. Thank you so much for your supporting and I really appreciate that.
