Sharon Hansen Our current administration seems hell bent on destroying job opportunities for Americans. This is tantamount to treason and should not even be considered by our government. The only people that this will appeal to is foreign students and corporations who get tax breaks for doing this. This is insane and whomever proposed this should be locked up. I will support no person who supports this.
