I FULLY SUPPORT THE NEW CHANGE OF INCREASING F1 OPT STEM EXTENSION PERIOD FROM CURRENT 17 MONTHS TO NEW PROPOSED PERIOD OF 24 MONTHS.I BELIEVE THIS INCREASED DURATION OF PRACTICAL TRAINING IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO FULLY UTILIZE THE EDUCATION WHICH THEY HAVE RECEIVED. ALSO THE SUBMISSION OF THE TRAINING PLAN PROPOSED FOR THE COMPANY WILL BE HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS TO GET WELL DIRECTED EXPERIENCE.
