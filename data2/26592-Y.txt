I strongly agree with this proposed rule. 10s of thousands foreigners are working in US with F-1 visa, and most of they are extermely outstanding so they could come to U.S and got a bachelor's degree or even master and PhD. They are working very hard for U.S. companies, and have created a great value for U.S.. To expand Training opportunties, it's not only gonna benefit U.S. but also benefits students their selves, to have more experience in U.S. so they can get better opportunities when they go back to their own country. So, I think this rule gonna benefits everybody and hope it will get passed.
