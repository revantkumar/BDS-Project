I believe OPT is mutually beneficial to both the foreign students and US. First of all, OPT indeed provides the foreign students a very good way to get more professional training from companies and other institutions. However, it is also an opportunity for US to attract the talented people from the world. These people have made or will make significant contribution to both economy and technology of US. For example, some of the foreign students joined the IT companies in Silicon Valley after graduation. They have contributed to the development of Google, Facebook, and other companies. Most of these people might have to return to their country after graduate immediately if there is no extension for OPT. This case would be a disaster to most of the IT companies. 

Second, there is a review processing for OPT, meaning only the graduates with good records can get an extension. Therefore, only the qualified and talented students will stay in US to work for longer time.
