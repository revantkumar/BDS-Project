Ben Jones It is ridiculous, to the American taxpayer, to allow the extension of the allotted time for OPT STEM students from 12 months to 36 months. We, the people, will be spending a lot more money due to the companies hiring foreign workers because they do not have to pay them the prevailing wage, or the 7+ percent of their share of the payroll taxes.

This should be against the law!
