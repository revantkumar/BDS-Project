I support the new OPT STEM extension proposal. 
Two years ago, I chose NYU as my university to pursue my master degree because NYU has a wonderful education quality with 27 months OPT which will help me go further in my early-stage career. If OPT changes to be only 12 months which means only one time chance for H1B visa, I would choose Canada or Australia over USA. Since these countries have more friendly policies to international students, and also have plenty of competitive and respected academic institutes like University of Toronto and University of Sydney, they will attract more talented international students. In this way, US academic sectors will be less competitive in the globe, and talented students attracted by other countries would enhance their science, tech and engineering. 

For example, one of the co-founder of Instagram Mike Krieger is also an international student from Brazil who also needs OPT and H1b to legally work in US after graduation. Imagining if the OPT policy became tougher, and Mike had to return to leave US. It's likely that Instagram won't be a success, and there are no job openings created by Instagram anymore. Even worse, another Instagram would be created in Brazil or somewhere else, and would compete with local social media product in US. 

Thus, this new OPT policy is beneficial for US academic sectors, and will help US to seize more talented people all over the world. These talent people would create more amazing enterprises which will create more job openings for local people and in turns improve the economy of US.
