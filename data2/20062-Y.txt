I strongly support the extension of Opt. Are those who oppose this out of your mind?! You think the extension would result in more Americans losing their jobs? WRONG! 

The truth is, without the diversity of our community, without attracting those engineering majors from other countries, especially those with American education background, we would end up losing competition in the world, and finally, we as a nation would become less and less competitive.

Foreigners will NOT rob your jobs!!! They would only CREATE BETTER environment for you to work!
