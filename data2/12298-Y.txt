Dear ICEB,

Even though I already passed the stage of OPT and now on work VISA, I feel the pain of having only 12 months of OPT. 
It is logical and make sense to have at least 24 months OPT, so that students have time to find a job and have all the paper 
work in place so that they can have meaningful training before they go for hunting their dream job.

Best Regards
