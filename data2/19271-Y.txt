The labor participation rate in this country is the lowest it has been in 38 years. Your proposed rule would increase the rewards for companies hiring foreign nationals and make it easier for them to do so.

I want to know how many American and legal resident STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field. I would also like to require a study be done as to exactly how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM grad employment.

If American and legal resident college grads with STEM degrees cannot find employment, fewer and fewer future students will opt to enroll in these difficult majors. The result will be a de facto brain drain that this nation cannot afford.
