Diversity is necessary for a healthy American economy, a healthy work environment and a healthy society. Support for the Opt extension. Underneath the opposition of this rule is the conviction that American are better than other people in their work, which is pure racism and discrimination. We have gone through this before, aren't we better than that? Stop looking at people through colored glass, give them a chance of happiness.
