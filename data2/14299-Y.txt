As an international student, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It is good for the U.S. government should let the students who received education in the U.S. keep making contributions to this country.

2. A consistent professional career in the U.S. for those international students who are excellent and intelligent can be powerful proof for the success of the global and open policy of the education in the U.S..

3. Diversity and freedom are the basic spirit of the United States.
