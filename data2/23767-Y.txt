I strongly support such action for the following reasons.
1, Many young talents graduate with a STEM degree from a top university: Harvard, Yale, MIT, Columbia, Cornell (you can name a few). They are highly skilled and valuable talents for this country. Plus the universities spend hundreds of thousands of money educating them. Without OPT Extension, many of them are FORCED to leave the country and cannot contribute any more. It's totally a waste of society's resources.
2, Those STEM degree holders are highly skilled and will certainly not pose a danger to the lower-skilled job market. In fact, what they do in their jobs will actually generate much more job opportunities and many US citizens will benefit from them.
3, STEM Extension is the only way for foreign students to obtain an H1B working visa. Without it, studying at Untied States will no longer be attractive at all. Therefore many US universities would face a decline in students enrollments, putting the jobs of some US workers in danger.
