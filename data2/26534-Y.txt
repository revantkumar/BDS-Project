The rule is very beneficial to the current US economy. This rule is going to relieve the stress from the H1B quote issue in recent years. Many students and their employers are not going to be affected by the ridiculous H1B lottery. With so many STEM talents working hard for US company willing to provide appropriate training, the US economic growth is going to be very strong for another few years. Thank you, Department of Homeland Security (DHS)! You did a great job!
