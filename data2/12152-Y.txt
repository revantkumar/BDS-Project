I am writing this down to strongly support the proposal of improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. This is not just for me, it's for thousands of international graduate students in STEM major and it's also for the United States, for every university with STEM majors, for every research organizations and national lab, for every STEM related companies. This proposal doesn't mean to give more jobs to international students, it just gives more opportunity to students with high quality for high-tech jobs and makes international students to have more opportunity to show themselves and find a right position for themselves, which also is a great benefit for the company.
