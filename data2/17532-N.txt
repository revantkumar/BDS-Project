It is exactly the opposite AMERICAN interest in America. We can take your poor and downtrodden ; in set quota fashion. We 
don't need our own Government jamming them down our throats. We struggle to pay our bills and the money it takes to 
fund the free ride Congress is giving unknown , illegal aliens. I'm paying and nobody asked me if I was good with that. Could 
I use the money the are throwing away on people looking for a free ride? Yes I could ,but as a tax paying, law abiding citizen
I am no entitled to it. My Congress tells me to tighten my belt while voting in a raise because they were hardly making ends 
meet. This is a goodtime to consider what a fair salary for then is. They would not be so happy to sleep with big business if 
they were making $60k/year.
Congress has failed The Bill of Rights, The Constitution, and their sworn duties as Congressmen. They have allowed the , 
almost laughable border security. They allowed the President to tie the hands of ICE and talked only of the rights of the 
trespassing illegals swarming our Country. Our Government has forsaken it's citizens and legal immigrants for it's place at the 
table of corporate America. If we are going to right this ship we are going to have to listen to the wisdom of our founders. As
Jefferson penned it; When the government no longer serves the people it is incumbent upon them to form a new one to 
better serve the needs OF the people FOR the people and BY the people. Unchecked capitalism, greed and lust for power 
have put the constituent way below the power lobby. Truth or lie?
