It is in the general benefit of the US economy if highly trained foreign STEM students are able to transition to being part of the highly skilled and tax paying US workforce rather than taking their training back to their home countries. In the current economy, post-graduation to first job time frames of greater than 12 months are very common. With the current 17 month OPT extension it is fairly common that a recently graduated student finds a job a few months before their OPT status expires. Commonly this leaves insufficient time to transition to a work visa before their OPT status expires. This frequently results in working foreign STEM student being required to quit their jobs and return to their home countries. The 24 month extension for foreign worker with STEM degrees with the last 2 years, would greatly facilitate transition from student to worker. 

The proposed extension of the OPT status extension from 17 to 24 months would provide significant benefit to the US economy by providing sufficient time for highly trained foreign STEM student to both find entry level first jobs in the US, to develop sufficient competency to be a sustained part of the US workforce and help avoid jobloss due to limited application windows for a work visa.
