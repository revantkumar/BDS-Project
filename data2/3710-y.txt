Chuck Bo I totally agree with this.

1. I think US government and universities spend a lot of time and money on F1 students. Why not give them a little more time to work for the US?

2. These students are not threatened to native Americans. As the fast development of related industries, the number of native American cannot satisfy the request at all. Besides, these competitions can only make both the foreign students and native students much better.

3. Other countries like China and India, they are developing really fast in recent years in this field. The technology gap between these countries are decreasing. According to this, http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/engineering , more and more Chinese university stand in top 100 engineering universities. If all these F1 students have no chance to work in the US and come back to their own country, the number will only be bigger.
