Wilbur Mao I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.

(1) It is required 3 years OPT to train a qualified STEM worker.

It provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after school 
training. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college
graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist (compared with the 3-5 years 
residency period of medical school graduates).

(2) U.S. will suffer from tremendous financial loss by revoking old STEM OPT
rule and failing to publish new one. 

Currently there are over 400000 STEM students studying in U.S. either in a 2
years master degree or in a 4 years undergraduate degree. The average 
tuition per year they spend is $30000. Totally U.S. education system 
receives 400000 * 30000 = 12000000000 = 12 billion USD per year. One of the 
most important reasons they choose U.S. for receiving advanced education is 
because it provides the best after-school training opportunity (17 months 
STEM OPT). If U.S. education system can not provide STEP OPT extension in 
the future. It will lose in the competition against other countries that are
providing it. Considering that a large portion of STEM students will 
abandon their future plan to study in U.S. That is a huge impact on the 
current U.S. education ecosystem that has already adapted to wide 
internationalization.
