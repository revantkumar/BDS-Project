Here is my concern about issuing this rule-
In my company, we have more than 50 STEM OPT hires. Not even one of them would qualify under "retaining talent"- they are just "cheap labor". We interviewed US citizens during the hiring process, and a lot of them were way-way better than the STEM OPT hires. However, according to my manager hiring STEM OPT's is significantly cheaper. 

The new 'formal training and mentoring program' will be made a mockery of. One of my friend who is a Senior Director at a Fortune 500 firm says that their company saves approximately $1 million just from the low pay rates of STEM OPT hires. They have already started working on establishing a so called 'training program', which he says he doesn't care about in reality.
There are a lot of very talented foreign students in the country, and I understand that it is very important to retain this talent. However, there needs to be a line drawn somewhere that this rule is not exploited just for employment. Foreign students just enrol in STEM programs in shady/low grade universities thinking that they can easily get a 29 months work permit. 12 months OPT should more than suffice for training purposes. After that established legal pathways should be followed.
