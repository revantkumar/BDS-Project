Once again the American Worker finds himself/herself at the back of the line when it comes to decent jobs in this country. The multinational corporations get everything they want from the Federal Government when it comes to providing the cheapest labor possible, and always at the expense of the American Worker. I am totally opposed to expanding the number of high tech and skilled workers being imported into this country to replace Americans. In fact, I think we need a 10-year moratorium on any new workers allowed into this country to work. Only when there is ZERO unemployment of Americans that want jobs or are qualified for high tech and skilled jobs should we allow anyone from another country to come here for employment. Period. And when they are allowed, no corporation should be allowed to pay less for that foreign worker than any American worker for that same job would be paid. The foreign worker hiring process needs to have all incentives removed from the process. And if a corporation forces a worker to train that foreign worker to take their job, the corporation must be forced to pay for retraining the displaced worker for another job that pays as well as the job they are being forced to give up. For once, the Federal Government needs to be working for the American People, not faceless corporations.
