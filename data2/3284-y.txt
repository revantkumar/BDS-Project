Yanxin Lu Hello officer,

I'm an international student pursuing a Ph.D degree in computer science at Rice University in Houston TX. I must defense my position and say that I support the OPT extension.

International students will have more time to work for the US companies. They will have sufficient time to be trained and make substantial contribution to the company. Without the OPT extension, companies in general wouldn't want ot hire international students, because the 1 year would be rather short for training and making contribution to the company.

I understand that it is a concern that foreigners might occupy too many job opportunities and the locals might have a difficult time of getting a job. My opinion to this concern is that this should not be handled by the government, but by the hiring companies, because they are the one who have better knowledge about how to minimize risk and maximize profit. I personally would think many companies will have a difficult time if the government "protect" the locals blindly without considering the effect to the local companies. 

America was founded by a group of people who had courage, wisdom and a heart of freedom and I think that most international students are similar. They left their contries and came here to look for freedom by using their courage and wisdom to help America and the world to be a better place. This spirit is what we should protect.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
