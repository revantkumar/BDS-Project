Anna Wong My company is expanding rapidly and has a lot of openings in development team. Usually OPT students are the ideal candidates for those jobs, as they work hard and do not require a high payment. Without OPT extension, we will lose a lot of current and potential talented employees. I strongly support the OPT extension
