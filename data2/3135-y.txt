Nairong Fan I think this is a policy beneficial for all sides. 
International students get the chance to contribute to American companies, and the companies can gain more for getting talented workers. 
For those who complain about unemployment of U.S. citizens, what I want to say is that if a American worker are good enough for a job, it will not be left to a foreigner anyway. This is a warning for those Americans who took employment for granted and never work hard to be competitive. This policy will encourage American workers to improve themselves, which will form a virtuous cycle for both workers and companies.
In addition diversity is one of the most important and valuable properties in American society, keep this property will definitely help the U.S. to be a better nation.
