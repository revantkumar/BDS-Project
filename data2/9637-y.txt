Yu Ye I think OPT expansion is not only an opportunities for international students to have an internship in US, it is a chance for the country to receive their returns. I think most of the international student work hard in their position and contribute to the US society. Also they bring their culture and knowledge into the enterprise.Obviously it is really beneficial for the company to grow. I don't agree the opinion that the OPT and the international students breed the lost of job of local people. Actually for international student if they want to be employed,they need much more effort than an local people need. The lost of job is caused by the financial environment. the other reason is some people they don't develop themselves and are lazy all the time. i think some people lost their job is due to their problems. on the other hand ,because the financial environment is not always good, so US need more intelligent people to enhance and create a better and clearer financial environment. As I said before, international student can help the enterprise grow. once these company get bigger, the more job opportunities are created.So actually the international student is helping american people finding their job. international student is not looting.They are just helping the world to become better.
