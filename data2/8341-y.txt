Y. Liu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of 24 months of OPT extension, for it is beneficial to both the country and international students.

24 months of OPT extension makes it possible for international student continue making contributions in the US as well as gaining valuable working experience after graduation. 

Such working experience would make us more competitive in the job market back in our own country and that is one of the primary reasons why we chose to further our education in the US as opposed to other countries such as UK. 

As a PhD student, I would prefer to utilize my skills and keep working on research projects after graduation which usually takes much longer time than 12 months. And the extension makes it possible.
