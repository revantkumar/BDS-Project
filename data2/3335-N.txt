We all understand the need for STEM workers, particularly those just completing their training. However, every effort should be made to employ our citizen STEM workers. If mentoring programs are to be set up, they should put U.S. citizen STEM students at the front of the line! OPT was designed originally to assist these F-1 nonimmigrant students visa holders to get and keep jobs when they returned to their home countries--not to take jobs from citizen STEM students. Keep it that way.
