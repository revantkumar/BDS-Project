I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Non-immigrant people bring long-term contribution to the country. Although they might take some jobs from native American, their work may bring more and more working opportunities in future.
2. America is an immigrant nation, which encourage people from all over the world with great skills working here. That's why the nation creates so many miracles in the world. Prevent skilled people from working for the nation and protect its citizen from competition is not the American spirits. Everyone including the citizens should evolved in this competition. Don't be spoiled! Make America be stronger and stronger.
