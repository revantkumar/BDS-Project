I am tired of the Obama regal presidency and all that it entails. There is a reason for the three divisions of our government
and the checks and balances they are to have. Obama has decided that he need not obey the constitution and need not involve congress and any thing he feels they may not agree with or support. Again there are reasons for that. If I can help curtail his regal dictates in this manner then I am happy to do so.

Sincerely
Bil Gleason
