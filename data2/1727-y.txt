Sibo Jiang United States America is great country built by immigrants. I understand that it became some people's concern that improving and expanding opportunities for F-1 student may hurt opportunities for some US citizens. However, in my opinion, we are now in a global economy environment, there's no way that a country can lock itself up and still be competitive.A great company needs great people, a great nation should think about how to attract those most skillful workforce from all over the world. Not to mention that US education system spends billions of tax money every year to offer best advanced educations to these F1 students with STEM degree. Why not take the advantage of the tax money we already spend? It makes no sense to kick these well educated highly skilled workforce out of this country right after they graduate and let them serve in other countries. 
Again, improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non immigrant student with STEM degrees will not cause US citizens' to lose their jobs but will only help this country to be great again.
