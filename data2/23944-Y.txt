Hi, I think expanding Training Opportunities is good because the US has devoted so much money and resources to educate international students. It will be very beneficial for the whole country if international students with advanced technology knowledge could stay longer and add more values to the development of technology industry here. Limited length of OPT has always been a barrier to securing a full-time job for international students because employers don't want to lose talents soon after recruiting them. However, if most of students just go home directly after graduation, the US will not be able enjoy the low-hanging fruits of educating technically intelligent young professionals. Therefore, I think expanding OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees is a smart move that will benefit the US economy in the long term.
