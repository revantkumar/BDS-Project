I strongly support this rule! It is not fair for international students if you stop the opt extension rule now. One of the important reason that we chose to come here for education was that we can have opt to improve our skills after graduation and before we go back to our own country. What's more, people with OPT contributed a lot to the American industry. So it is necessary to pass this rule!
