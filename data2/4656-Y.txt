I'm a international student whose major is digital communication, my entire family is very proud of me come study at US. I suffered a lot at U.S, but I have to say U.S. is a great country, it gives me second life, it teaches me truth and knowledge, I complete my life, which I never thought before at U.S., I love this country, so I want pay back to its generous and mercy. OPT for me doesn't only mean the way to H1b VISA, it means how I will continue to connect with US, yes, OPT gives me a job, temporarily you may say I occupy a position that supposed to belong to Americans, but how do you know it won't be paid back with thousand of jobs to America, and Americans. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience brought by OPT policy, but we will work hard to make it a worth decision, to us, and to Americans.
