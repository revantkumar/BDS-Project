I have been disappointed in the foreigners. I can rarely understand their English. I have also been shafted by one group, they were so nice! I was rooked because in college I particularly identified with the foreign students from all over over the world. If they live in a America and they are not taking the much needed jobs of our people, that is fine. If they go back home they should find great jobs in their countries. Should we have to go to their county, learn their language to get a job in America?

May we add, foreign students do not study American History in order to graduate. We are missing a wonderful opportunity to enrich their lives. Maybe we wouldn't be at war if the students understood our history. Our own students need to know our history. This is the area in which we are greatly lacking. Every elected official should be able to pass a history test.
The rest of us should thirst for hisstorical knowledge.
