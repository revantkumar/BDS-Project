I STRONGLY support this new OPT extension rule.

I'm an international master student major in Computer Science. I am currently an intern at CodeBroker LLC as a Java Software Developer.
There are many countries I can choose to pursue my master degree other than US. The reason I choose US is the industry training opportunities after graduation, which is a great benefit for me. The training helps me to convert all the skills I learn from school into real productive experience.
Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. This is a huge loss to the US universities and schools because international students pay higher tuition fees which becomes a main income of many universities and schools.

I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my current work experience, it takes almost 6 month to get familiar with company development platform before the employee become productive and efficient. Also, many company projects usually takes up to 1 year to complete. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers would lose their VISA before completion of company projects. It cause a huge lose to the company.

As a Chinese STEM student, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.

Hope more people support this excellent rule!
