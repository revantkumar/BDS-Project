I strongly support the proposal to extend F-1 nonimmigrant student optional practical training (OPT) time to 24 months, because it will benefit America greatly, both economically and technologically.

On the economics side, extending the optional practical training time will allow more and more high educated students come into industry, and contribute their knowledge and experiences to industry, thus creating more value to society, in this way it will definitely proper the current economy. I bet at least those Internet companies will slow down 50% without those higher educated labors. It could be the same in other industry too. 

On the technology side, international students coming from different nations will bring their own ideas and thinking strategies into industry. In this way, innovation is simulated and great ideas will come out. Take Silicon Valley as an example, without the collision of great minds coming from different backgrounds, how will new ideas come about? Extending OPT will definitely enhance the chance of technology improvement and innovation.

Based on the above reasons, I strongly support the proposal to extend OPT time to 24 months.
