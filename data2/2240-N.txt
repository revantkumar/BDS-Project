This is an outrage, why does our current administration insist on helping foreigners and the rich over the average American
As a former teacher I see such a big need to help keep out children in school. We have a lot of young talented Americans 
that are slipping between the cracks and end up either unemployed or getting jobs that wages will never be enough to support 
a family. Why aren't we spending money on our own children, why aren't we giving small companies tax breaks to train young
Americans so they can get a skill and be self sufficient. There is so much to do to help our own people and our government 
insists on placing the needs of the rich and foreigners first, this has got to stop.
