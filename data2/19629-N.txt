As a legal, "senior", United States citizen I'm appalled that OPT has been able to raid social security funds for reason that do not benefit social security recipients (present and future). 

I have worked all my adult life, paid into social security (through no choice of my own) and now have to work part time to supplement my savings and social security income. Now, the money that was taken from my pay is used to assist foreign workers in taking American jobs. This is crazy!

Our legal American citizens should be first in receiving any benefits from our government. After all veterans, elderly, and homeless (legal citizens) are taken care of, we should look to help others.

There is nothing wrong (in fact, it should be lauded) in taking care of Americans first. American jobs/training should go to American FIRST.

I took the time to let you know how I feel. I look forward to hearing from you and hope you take the time to respond to my comments. Please don't brush me off with a form letter.

Lee Wheeler
