As a thirty three year educator in the filed of mathematics, I am appalled at what you propose to do by expanding the time
foreign students can stay and work in the U.S. Our kids need those jobs and we do not need foreign students here and employers
paying all the taxes on their salaries. There is also no guarantee that the salaries will not be cut lower than most of our 
graduates would expect to earn and therefore keep them from being hired. Also it seems that we already have legally passed 
laws that say how long they can stay and they signed agreements to abide by them. If I read the separation of powers 
agency does NOT have the power to void legally passed laws by congress. Lastly, their countries are expecting them to 
return and begin to apply their knowledge in these fields in order to help their less fortunate countries to make things better
for their own people.
