Paul Collier Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the proposed rule to extend STEM optional practical training (OPT) to 24 months. Extending OPT for 24 months makes good sense. Providing international students the opportunity to pursue post-graduation training will help U.S. colleges and universities remain competitive in a global higher education market. I also applaud the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for recognizing the benefits to the U.S. economy of hosting international students, and the significant contributions to research and innovation that come from retaining highly educated individuals in the STEM fields here in the U.S. Extending OPT for 24 months will also aid U.S. employers that must have a means of employing the best and the brightest young graduates in science and technology in the face of an H-1B cap which remains too low. 

My concern in the way the proposed rule is written centers around the greater administrative burden placed on schools. As we are all aware, U.S. colleges and universities have been charged with tracking and reporting on the activities of international students in ways that already stretch limited school resources. If DHS moves forward with new requirements for mentoring and training plans and periodic evaluations for all students during the OPT extension period, it is my hope that DHS will seek to minimize the administrative burden on Designated School Officials (DSOs) and clarify that DSOs have no responsibility for reviewing mentoring and training plans or evaluations. The DSO role should be limited to collecting and maintaining records for DHS review. It would also be my hope that DHS would accept responsibility for contacting F-1 students directly with reminders for periodic evaluations rather than shifting the responsibility to schools. The responsibility for educating employers about STEM OPT requirements also should not fall to schools. 

Thank you for this opportunity to comment.
