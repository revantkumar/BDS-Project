I totally support this proposal, my reasons are listed below:

1. Giving opportunity to foreign students is consistent with American belief. USA is a country emphasizing its equal human right, why will it be challenged in the fair career competition with those foreign students? Everyone should have equal opportunity to get a job in the US, don't we?

2. Smart STEM students are making money for the U.S. In USA, so many companies need to hire smart students (especially in STEM majors) to support their development, and they will make huge contributions to no matter the company's development or the country's economy development. If we don't give the opportunity to them, how can American economy get developed with limited population?

3. Talent is the key of competition. Most STEM students have advanced knowledge base and rich experience in the school and let them go back home will lose this precious talent source and increase the difficulty competing with other countries.
