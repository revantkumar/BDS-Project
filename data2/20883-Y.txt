I think the OPT extension program for STEM degrees is very necessary. Here is my personal experience to explain why I support it. I am a researcher in one university research institute, focusing on the area of transportation engineering. I am currently using my OPT for this position and working on two projects that will end in 2-3 years. Since I am the key person in these projects, if I can not keep my OPT status, I will be forced to leave the U.S. and these two projects will be ruined. I think I am not the only one in such a situation. That also means this OPT extension program is very necessary since it just gives enough time for STEM graduates to finish their training and avoid potential losses for the emplyers. This is a Win-Win decision. In addition, providing foreign researchers a chance to work in the U.S. is a smart decision since those people are the top ones in their own countries. There is a high chance for them to open up a new field and provide more job positions for American citizens.
