I strongly agree this proposal to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees. 

Many US companies, especially high tech industry, are hiring thousands of F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees every year. US companies as well as our economy will suffer numerous project delays and incredible losses if this proposal got rejected.

For the benefit of our country and economy, I strongly suggest our government to pass this proposed rule.
