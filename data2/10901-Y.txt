I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance and equal rights. And gifted students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.
2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area.
3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more gifted students coming to study in US.
4. It's good for US people to have more chances to contact foreign people with high education and high quality.
