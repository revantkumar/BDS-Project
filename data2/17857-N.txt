Don't expand the OPT program it hurts American workers who are looking for work. This administration is destroying Americans and rewarding non citizens with jobs that Americans should be offered first. Our younger generation is struggling to find a full time job, thanks to Obama Care, and now this administration is being in non citizens to take even more jobs away. I have always thought that the first duty of government was to work for the citizens of the country who elected them. Obviously the current administration has other goals that do not support the citizens of our country.
