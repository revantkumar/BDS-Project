It is the American student who needs the improved and expanded training opportunities. It is the American STEM student and current worker who is having his/her hopes dashed because the STERM jobs are gong to "immigrants." Those "nonimmigrant" students of today may become the "undocumented worker(s)" of tomorrow whose status is being legitimized in defiance of the constitution and a federal court. Do not create this rule!
