I fully support this rule to expand the STEM OPT program for the following reasons: 

(1) More than 50% of the graduate students earning a MS or PhD degree in esteemed US universities are foreign born. Given the ceiling on H1 visa, the US industries would be starved of talent if the STEM OPT was uprooted
(2) On the economic stand point, each international student brings a revenue of $50K on an average, which does not add to US debt in any regard. This is the life blood of many universities given deficit in federal funding. Cutting STEM OPT will send the signal that immigration is tightening and will definitely affect this revenue
(3) One major point of WashTech was that employers need not pay 15.2% of payroll taxes by hiring an international candidate. But over $118,000 the payroll tax is only 2.9%, and PhD candidates definitely make that much. By citing it as a reason if they uproot the OPT, they will lose 25% of the taxes which the non-citizens pay if the jobs were exported outside the US
(4) The purchasing potential of these candidates who hold high position creates additional jobs in both the skilled and unskilled labor domain
(5) Many tech start-ups in the silicon valley were started and are kept alive by students with advanced STEM degrees, harming the program would adversely affect economy in several ways
