I do not agree with giving favored status to foreign students above our own American citizens! 
It is way past time to begin favoring United States Citizens who are willing to study and learn specialized skills.
With such a high rate of unemployment and the loss of many jobs in this country since 9/11, it is imperative that we
give our own citizens every advantage in advancing their education and skills. Why give incentives to employers 
to favor foreign students??? Why not give incentives to hire our own Citizens first? I disagree with this Proposed Rule!!!
