I strongly support the proposed OPT extension program.

The only downside of this proposal seems to be decreasing job opportunities for U.S. citizens once it pass. BUT, it won't. This proposed program will simply give those who are talented and good at their jobs a better chance to continue working in the country which will benefit the U.S. economy because those workers will bring profit to the companies in the U.S. by using their knowledge gained in their own country AND United States. 

Companies are not hiring the OPT or OPT STEM students because they are cheap workers. The employees who uses OPT or OPT STEM get paid the same amount as U.S. citizens in most cases. On the contrary, the company will need to spend more money to apply a working visa for those employees in the future if they want them to stay in the company which most companies do. Companies put in a great investment to the individuals who first start in the industry (people who use OPT or OPT STEM to work are all recent graduates and most of them didn't have any industry experience). Why would a company put so much effort in an employee just to let them go in a year?

America is a great country, the best some might say, and what makes this country so great is that it welcomes foreigners, allow them to bring knowledge and talent here to make the country even better and attracts more talents. This proposed OPT extension program will significantly help those international students who wants and qualified to continue working in the U.S after graduation, in the meantime, it will also be good to the economy in this country. After all, it's a bit ridiculous to let someone who's excellent at their job go just because where they were born and this program will prevent that.
