I strongly SUPPORT this proposal as an international STEM student in Statistics. I did an internship in the Summer which is to build a predictive model for an Insurance company with their analytics team. However, Im only involved in the first 2 month of the project and the project is actually intended to be a 3-year long project. I want to follow the whole process of of project after my graduation, which needs at least 3 years time for OPT. This proposal in definitely reasonable for student in STEM!
