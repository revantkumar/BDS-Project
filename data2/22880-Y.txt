I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the follow the following reasons:

A. Government should keep these talented students in the US to allow them to make further contributions to this country.

B. The whole country will not exist without immigrants. Immigration and competition for better lives are rooted in American spirit. Americans are not afraid of competition; competition only pushes us to become better.

C. International students do not threat domestic students. There's still gaps for talents in the STEM fields. As companies are inclined to hire domestic students, international students are only accepted when companies cannot find Americans who suit the jobs.
