I strongly support OPT extension. STEM graduates work in the high tech and are irreplaceable. It is always hard for high tech companies and research institutes to find qualified employees because very few people have the STEM expertise. STEM foreigners are not competing with other Americans but instead filling those vacancies. They generate billions of dollars benefit for America, create thousands of job opportunities for Americans and strengthen America's leading role in science and technology. New OPT extension rule shall be passed, for the best interest of United States !
