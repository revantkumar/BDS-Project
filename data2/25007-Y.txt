I support the 24 month OPT STEM extension instead of 17 months. With 24 months extension, one can get multiple attempts to apply for H1B visa which is hard to get selected in lottery these days because of large number of applicants. F1 students work hard and spend a lot of money (especially students from India and China. Sometimes all their parents savings) to get quality education in the US and then make a bright career here in the field they love. This helps US too with research, new businesses and skilled workforce. If such skilled workers are refused the work visa - H1B, they might have to go back to their home country. Its a loss for them as well as US economy. I stronly believe in encouraging OPT STEM extension to 24 months.
