Al Jacquez Greetings - It has come to my attention that The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.

I have also learned that OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

These two facts alone demonstrate the need to shrink, not expand or renew this program

Thank you
