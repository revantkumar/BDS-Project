I highly support this proposal.
Since I'm a graduate student currently study in U.S., I really want to stay here to do more contributions to the country, because I have learnt a lot of things here. 
And I heard that what I am learning - Technical Art - is also very lack in U.S. in many film industry and game industry. So my stay can help to make this industry develop more rapidly.
We pay tax as all other people in U.S., so we are doing good to the country. Please let us stay longer to find a job that attribute to the country!
