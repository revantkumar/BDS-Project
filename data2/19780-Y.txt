I have really appreciated the idea of OPT on F-1 Student visa. The idea of Optional Practical Training is to provide an opportunity to the students from various countries, who come to U.S. for education, to have practical experience in the United States before they go back to serve their home counties. The period of 1 year seems to be appropriate for "practical training" in any field. 

I have never been a fan of STEM extensions. The fact that DHS distinguishes between the STEM and non-STEM students in fixing the allowed duration for OPT may be due to one of the following two reasons:

1. Either the DHS, at an institutional level, believes that STEM fields are so superior and highly specialized than other fields like law, humanities, journalism etc, that they require up to 3 year just to provide training for the work; or

2. DHS is using STEM OPT just as a disguise to provide work authorization to the "TECHIES" from countries like India and China. It is also to give them more chances to try their luck in H-1B lotteries.

If you try and contact the largest companies in the STEM field, none of them will have such enormous and extravagant training programs which last for three long years. Most training programs last for a maximum of 6 months. Given the facts that the students are from an alien country, even 1 year seems to be apt. 

Therefore, I can't seem to understand the need for STEM extension either for 17 or 24 months. I would strongly recommend giving same treatment to all the students and making the OPT 3 years for all or for none. 

The court questioned the legality of the procedure followed to initiate STEM extension for 17 months. The DHS, in an endeavor to overcome that, has come up with this proposal.
