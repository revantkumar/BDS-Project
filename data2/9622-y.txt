Xinzhu Li I totally support the extension of OPT for STEM students, because it is beneficial to America.
First, most the STEM students are engineers, who can make great economic contribution to the country. However, most American students do not like studying engineering. Make the international students stay in US and make money for US, it is definitely a good thing! They don't steal jobs from natives, they just do the jobs natives don't like. So it will not increase unemployment rate of American citizen. 
Second, extension of OPT doesn't mean more immigrants. Jobs don't equal to Green Cards. Most STEM students go back home after OPT, no need to panic. 
Third, the only way to protect the right and benefits of citizens is improving economics. Which means developing technology in today's world! So it is reasonable to choose the most suitable candidates, no matter where he is from. 
Extension of OPT is a long-term and profound action, everyone should support it! !
