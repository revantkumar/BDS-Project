Gentlemen;

I find it incredible that the United States is increasingly giving preference to foreign workers over the unemployed American citizen.

A number of years ago one of my associates, a Christian pastor was called to serve a congregation in Canada. He was given a temporary visa but eventually expelled from the country because Canada felt that a Canadian could fill the job just as well.

America needs immigration laws that support the unemployed American over immigrants. Why should American families suffer want while an immigrant receives preferential treatment in job selection?

I urge you to abandon your proposed ruling on this issue.
