Opt Stem is necessary and important for U.S. economy!

First, it's consistent with the core value of this immigration country! I would be a pity if this country who's been admired for its openness to people from all over the world would shut the door to the highly educated foreigners just because it threatened the "immigrant" who embarked on this land earlier than current foreign students!

Second, competition drives the economy. If native Americans are afraid of competition, and utilize the cancellation of the opt stem to take laziness for granted, I'm really concerned about the long term development of this country.

Third, the U.S. Needs the contribution of students with stem background. Think about the original reason of offering the opt stem; it was because the natives favor non-stem majors when they pursued their educations and career. If so many stem students will have to leave the country, it will pose unimaginable threat to the economy.
