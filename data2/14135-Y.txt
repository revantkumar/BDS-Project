One of many reasons that America is the greatest country right now is that it is an immigrant country with best talents here. It will be very stupid to let those Phds in Science to leave after training them for more than 5 years. The reason that some of the great companies like google, facebook, Goldman, JPM keep growing and innovating through the years is that there are more and more talents graduated from school went to the position where needs them. If America let those graduates from stem program leave, the job market wouldn't be as competitive as before, some of the position wouldn't be filled considering the warming job market right now, which is probably a good thing for somebody do not want to put too much effort on job hunting, but would let this country lose one of their big advantages.

Personally I think 24 months extension will be fair since if it's 17 months most people will have to choose to graduate in December so that they will have three chances to be selected for H1B
