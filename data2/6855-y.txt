Adam Jiang I strongly agree with the new rule of OPT.

In recent days, a lot of people think we can get our jobs by keeping foreign students away. However, this is not the truth. From the results of a lot of survey, half of the graduates of STEM major are international students. If all the international students have to go home after graduate, who should our high companies hire? Hire a truck driver to design IC, hire a lawyer to develop google's program? This is not reasonable, right?

We need foreign students to work here and make contribution to the US.
