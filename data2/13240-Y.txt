I strongly support proposal:

There is not reason for the government to let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and courage them to keep making contributions to the U.S..

Culture diversity is very important U.S. spirit. And it is what makes U.S. so strong nowadays.

Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It helps the whole society get more stable and strong.
