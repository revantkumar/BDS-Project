As a potential student, I totally agree with this policy. International students are getting harder and harder to have the working visa in U.S. Though those who are really needed by this country get a decent job, they still get only little chance to receive the working permission, which is a damage for the development of the industry in U.S. Those students who stay are never ordinary workers, they have the skill this country need, also, a lot of awesome people's parents or even their own used to be international students and eventually make great contribution to this country. So I strongly support this policy.
