I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from university in USA and let them keep making contributions to this country

2. Diversity is the most valuable point in USA.

3. Many current working positions cannot find suitable natives. In addition, the competition can help boost USA worker's quality.
