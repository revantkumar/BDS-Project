Deidre Swanson I support the extension. First, university use fellowship to attract those brilliant students to come to US and we need them to make contributions to the US development. There is no reason to waste the investment from university. Second, the development of the country is proportional to the intellects amount. It does not hurt to keep many intellects since we all know that the reason why US is strong is partially because US absorbs many intelligent refuges from World War II.
It does hurt to always have someone to work in science field. It takes 10-20 years to culture such knowledgable students in science field. It is unwise to push them back to their own country because we still need a lot of people to work and promote the scientific research development.
