Shawn Han I agree with the policy about improving and expanding the training opportunities for students with STEM degrees. There is no denying that more and more international students who benefits from this proposal, if get through, will surly help the American economy meet a tremendous increase. Besides, Plenty of high-level labor will get its opportunity to pursue its dream and happiness on this continent of freedom. It accords with the essence of American dream.
