I strongly support this proposed rule. America used to be a country which attracts countless excellent science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) specialists from all over the world and I hope it will still be in the future. This helps the citizens in the country live a way better life than most of these foreign specialists and their families in their own country. I do not understand why there are people who want to stop this.
