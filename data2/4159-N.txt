Dear Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau:

The proposed rule by the Department of Homeland Security is not in the best interest of the current American workforce as it seeks to expand the opportunities of foreign students over those of our own citizens. The short term cost benefits to the employers who hire the foreign students cause long term issues with the lack of taxes paid versus the taxes required to be paid on American workers by the government. And the loss of wages to be earned by citizens hurts the economy per the multiplier effect of spending by them and saving. Again, existing citizens end up bearing the cost with not only lost jobs but also paying extra taxes to make up for those taxes not rightly paid by the employers. Thank you.
