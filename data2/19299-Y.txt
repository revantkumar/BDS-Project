I strongly support this proposal because the OPT extension is only for students with master and doctoral degrees in STEM field. This will not impact the vast majority of American workers because jobs requiring master or doctoral degrees are only a small portion of the entire job market. On the other hand, those students are among the most talented people in the world. They can make great contributions to further improve America's technology and economic power, which will be beneficial to every American in a long term.
