Look I will keep this simple------------------

Our middle class has had war declared upon it, in addition to the war on women, war on coal, war on climate change, war by IRS on conservatives, war on veterans, and war on Christians.

Employment Payroll to Population figures show we are hurting, wages are flat or in a downward spiral. 

Gosh, lets look out for our own rather that make war on them???????????????????
