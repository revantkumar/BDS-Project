Anonymous Respected chief,

I fully support STEM EXTENSION. The most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy. 

The STEM extension rule proposed will also be highly beneficial to the international students. Their future and hopes depend on the STEM.

Thanking you for this opportunity to comment.
