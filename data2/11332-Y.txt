I strongly support this amendment to the old rules. The new rules will not only benefit the U.S. economy, but also exhibit the superiority of human right and freedom on this land. Nowadays the competition among countries are essentially dependent on the number and quality of great scientists and engineers. Students with STEM degrees are intelligence powers and contributing to various fields from fundamental scientific research to advanced engineering technologies. These people are pushing forward the development of science and technology, which is the fundamental of economy, military, health and better life quality. Giving excellent people more opportunities to contribute to the U.S. is giving U.S. more opportunities to develop more advanced technologies and supply better life for its people. I really hope these rules can be approved and lots of most intelligent people can accomplish influential work without any limitation.
