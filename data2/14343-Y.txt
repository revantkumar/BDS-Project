The OPT extension program helps the US as a country as well as the international students looking to gain some experience.

While hiring international students on an F1 visa employers debate the merits of investing in the H1B application for that particular student. If he/she is not going to be able to work for the employer long enough for them to reap the benefits then they are forced to let him/her go inspite of the student's skill set. This is a loss to both the student and the employer.

As a international student (from India) the number of H1B visa applications are numerous but the quota allotted in the lottery system is quite low. This practically gives the students a 50-50 chance of obtaining a visa irrespective of their caliber.

As one can apply for H1B only once during a 12 month period, the 50-50 chance is a huge gamble. Hence any sort of extension would be appreciated as it would give a better chance of successfully obtaining the H1B visa.
