I strongly support this new STEM for F-1 immigrants. It's good not only for those international students but also to US.
My reasons are:
1. To those F-1 students: they work hard in these important domains and are ones of the most talented people in the world. They spend years in the US learning and working. Now, US is their home. And STEM is the most important way to let them realize their American dream. And they deserve it.
2. To US: US has been using a it of recourse to train these international students and workers. And after their graduation, they are ready to contribute and feed back to US. In other words, they are a necessary force which can build US a even better country. USA can't affort losing them. Especially, in several domains such as Chemistry and pharmaceutical industry, Asian employees are working extremely hard and contribute a lot to US economy. US has to keep them so as to keep the contry more wealthy.
3. To all the people in the US. International employees are very friendly in the US. They never hurt anybody and are always very good friends of locals employees. They make the society more diverse and peaceful.

Hope you consider my opinions. Thank you.
