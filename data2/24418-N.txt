According to the center for immigration studies the OPT program has so far
cost young Americans 430,000 jobs from 2009 to 2013 and has siphoned Four
Billion dollars from the social security and medicare programs. It is high
time to develop programs that benefit Americans for a change and scrap this
destructive and enormously wasteful OPT program !
