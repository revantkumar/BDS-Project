Jiri Dvorak To whom it may concern,

It is my opinion that F-1 STEM degree program is really beneficial for the student involved and American economy and society at large. 

The students get a chance to prove and hone their skills and expertise as well as defend the status of their university. 

The companies get much needed qualified labor in the fields where the shortage is the worst. This brings competition that drives further improvement for all the personnel. 

Improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for eligible F-1 students is a step in the right direction.

Sincerely,
