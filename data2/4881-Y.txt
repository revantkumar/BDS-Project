The US government should allow international students to have more than a year's opportunities to work in the states. I speak this as a United State permanent residence. 
First, the more smart people US has, the stronger economy that US will receive. If an American University spend four years or even more to train a higher educated man and then send him back to his original country because of one year OPT, that would be a big lost to America and a waste of using the county's education resources. 
Second, to think a bigger goal and put nationalism aside for a while. If we, all humankind want to live a better life and give our great grand children and their children a promising future, we should invite more talented people to come to US and let them contribute their knowledge, because America is an excellent place for all kind of scientists and artists to work, grow and glow. What they achieve here will have a great impact to not only the Uniterd States, but also the future of the world. 
In short, I don't see why we shouldn't extend the OPT, since America is a land of promise. 

Thanks! God blessed America- the land of the brave!
