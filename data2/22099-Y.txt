I am in favor of the new proposal to extend the STEM OPT extension to 24 months benefiting both F-1 students with a STEM degree and U.S employers. I also request for the current grace period that F-1 students are allowed to stay in the U.S to seek an employer to be extended as competition for new hires gets tougher than ever. 

Thank you.
