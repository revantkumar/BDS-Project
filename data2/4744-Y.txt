I strong support this regulation, because the termination of the OPT extension will be a disaster for the engineering industry. Most of engineering companies rely on the contribution of OPT students. They are well educated and with passion. Without them, the whole environment will be changed. Companies can hardly find enough staffs in short time to fill the vacancy. I cannot imagine the future.
