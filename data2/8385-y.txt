Anhong Guo I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

Firstly, the students who attended schools in the US should be allowed to practice their skills learnt in school and contribute back to the community. 

Secondly, education and career should be fair, international students should be given the chance to prove their abilities in the US. It will for sure have an impact on the employment, but it's only making the society better with fair competition.

Thirdly, diversity has always been embraced by the US. People from all over the world come to the US to pursue their education and career, and have made great contribution to the country and to the world.
