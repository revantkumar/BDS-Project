I strongly support this policy
STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.
Without practical training the education for 17 months will not prove to be beneficial to the students
Students will leave US, in the middle of their practical training with half-baked experience, if the OPT stem is not for a minimum of 3 years
It takes a total period of 4 years to master the field experience of stem ( like IT experience without 4 years of practical experience is not preferred by an employer).OPT Stem extension should be for 24 months
