Jianing Yan I totally agree with the OPT extension for STEM students. First, international students come to United States for studying and working doesn't means they want to immigrate. The education quality of STEM major in United States is prior to other countries. It is naturally that students who study STEM want to pursue their master or PHD degree in United States. Then after graduating, even in their homelands, they will find a job to transfer the knowledge into practical experience. No wonder in Unites States, where both technology and equipments are advanced. However, studying and working here doesn't means living here. A country which is suitable for personal development doesn't equal to an ideal place to live. Cultural difference is always exists. Therefore, immigration is not always the ending for international STEM students. Secondly, OPT extension for STEM students is a win-win proposal for both students and US companies. If HRs of a company would love to hire a STEM student which means the student is definitely outstanding and can contribute to the whole company. Then the extended 24 months OPT is really a good chance for company to keep the position for the hired student. If not, the proposal not really works, and would not cause further influences. In short, if the proposal works, it definitely would contribute to the profits of the companies, and hence impact economy and technology of Unites States.
