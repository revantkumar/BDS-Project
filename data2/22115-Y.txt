I strongly agree with this 24-month OPT extension rule for F-1 students.

First of all, F-1 students benefited a lot from American education and in return would love to give back. A lot of F-1 students are excellent employees and make great contributions to American economy, society and engineering. OPT rule provides them such the opportunity to learn more and give back more to express their appreciation. 

Moreover, the OPT rule also attracts foreign students to pursue degrees in the United States. Foreign students are not only willing to learn advanced knowledge, but also looking for applying the knowledge in the real world. 12-month is relatively short. It normally takes an employee 2-3 years to become expert in his position. Thus, 24-month OPT extension rule, which other countries won't provide, makes American education more popular among foreign students. Those outstanding F-1 students coming together from different races, nationalities, religions and sexes would also bring cultural diversity and fresh ideas to American universities.

Finally, with increasing demands of employees, IT engineers for example, many companies have hired thousands of F-1 students and would like to hire more. Because of the revocation of 17-month extension, these companies will suddenly face a big loss. This 24-month extension rule would prevent this loss to US companies, as well as American economy.

I do hope that this rule will finally be approved.
