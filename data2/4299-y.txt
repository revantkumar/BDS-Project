Bing Yang I totally support this proposal, currently students only have 17-month opt extensions at most, and most of them only have 2 chances to get a H1B, it's harder and harder to get a H1B now, some very talented foreigner students and workers have to leave without H1B in 2 years, that is a loss for company and the country. We should extend the length of OPT extension, give those great foreigner students and workers more time, more chance.
