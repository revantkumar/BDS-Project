I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. OPT extension rule will attract a lot of international students to the US to study. The universities and colleges will benefit from their expensive tuition. They use the resource and learn knowledge in the university, most of whom are grad students. After graduation, they can apply what they learn to the US companies. US companies will benefit from their technical skills and knowledge.

2. A lot of international students will contribute to the US tourism. As we all know that international students don't have financial problem, so they will do a lot of travelling and shopping, which will benefit the US economy. Also, their families will come to visit them once a year or more, which stimulates the growth of aviation industry and economy.

3. OPT extension rule is only for STEM major students. In the class of these majors, most of the students are foreigners, which means Americans don't like taking these classes or they don't want to do this kind of jobs. So it is reasonable to let foreigners do this highly technical jobs. Why a lot of US companies still want to hire international students even if they will have to leave the country after OPT? They think the international students are doing better than Americans in these fields. Therefore, OPT extension rule will benefit the US companies since they bring what they learn, their intelligence and diligence to their employers.
