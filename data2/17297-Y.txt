I think STEM students should have OPT extension. 

My girlfriend and I are both international students from Asia. To be honostwe are neither genius researchers who published outstanding papers nor talented programmers who developped cool products. We are just common computer science studentsdoing homework every week and getting a grade slightly above the average. But we both got job offers. I don't think we are obviously better than US peoplein factwe are not as good as them in English communication which is extremely import in job interviews. What I want to say iswe get jobs simply because job market is huge. We are not taking away job opportunities from US people. Insteadboth US people and international people are sharing this huge market. I believe there are US people who cannot find jobsbut companies only recruit people whom they think qualify. In current huge technology market desiring STEM studentsif you qualifyyou get jobs. If you don't qualifyreducing number of competitors won't help.
