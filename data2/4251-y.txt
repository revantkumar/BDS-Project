Brian Salerno A very positive proposal. In my opinion 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on experiences of my friends, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. With insufficient time frame under OPT, foreign STEM workers working on those project would lose their VISA before the projects complete.
