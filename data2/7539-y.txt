Jeffery Qiao I strongly support this policy for the two reasons:
1.For US high-tech companies, it will greatly reduce company cost on human resource. Not only the payment for employees, but also the cost of enhancement for their employees' skills. For international students, practical training is frequently key of F-1 students' educational experience. 
2.Us economy will gain a lot from this policy which can keep tons of talented foreign people in IT service. If the policy stop, US will lose competitive attraction for talented foreign student which is a serious trouble.
