Yuming Wei The new 24-month extension of OPT is truly a benefit for the United States.

Since high-tech and engineering area are of a huge part of US economic growth and STEM major talents are perfect fit for these area, there should be opportunity for them.

Higher education in US is among the best and students from all over the world would come to pursue their higher degree. After several years of education, if these talents, who will show their power in their area, cannot work in US only because of short legally work time, they will seek somewhere outside US that they can use what they learn in US. This is a huge loss of educated talents.

The skill of STEM major students need practical practice in the industries due to the sophisticated features of the profession. So longer legally working time in US is needed for talented aliens.

There is a say that employment of talented aliens leads to high unemployment rate of US. I don't think so. Since what I see is that in STEM major, at least in Electrical Engineering, more than 2/3 students are aliens. And STEM major student will seek job related to their major or they will not qualified for working visa. So there is less competition with local people. Thus there is no need to shorten the time for alien legally work in US.

If educated alien talents can find fit position in US, they can help company grow bigger and the US economy will grow, thus more opportunities are created for more than just STEM major area for other local people.

In all, the new 24-month extension for STEM major student is definitely a benefit for US. Educated alien talents can use what they learn in US education system to benefit US economy and may create more job opportunities for others.
