Mindy Ming I strongly support this proposal!
1) As we all know, science and technology are the main driving power of a society. Talent people are the key to our society's development. These students got advanced knowledge and skills through American people's educations resources. If they would like to contribute to our country, that's great and useful. Why would we let them go back to their country and contribute their countries and compete with us in future?
2)Yes, there is a little competition for local American people, but competition leads process and can drive people to improve themselves.
3) look at Japan and Europe, they are experiment old age crisis, but America doesn't have it. That's because we always welcome talents to this great country, which is created by great people who love to contribute this country.
Hope we can support this proposal and open our mind to all talents people from the world.
