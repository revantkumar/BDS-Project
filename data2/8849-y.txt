Yiru Zhang I support the proposal.
I really don't think F1 students are gonna compete job opportunities with Americans, instead, most of them are doing the jobs that Americans don't want to do, e.g. research job. There are a lot of excellent international students and researchers in biology, chemistry, physics who are doing very hard research jobs but making little money. On the other hand, only few Americans really want to study fundamental science, even fewer want to spend their whole life doing boring research. I have a american friend who got a master degree of chemistry but chose to quit his research after graduation because research isn't his real interest. It is true that most of people are not able to become a great researcher even though they are working hard and are very smart. Research is a hard job which is required not only interest, hard working, but also talent. A good OPT policy can help this country select the most talented people from all over the world and let them make a difference to the country.
