Shiqi Yin I strongly support the extension. Here are my reasons for the support:

Unites Stated is currently facing STEM workforce shortage. International students with advanced degree are precious to every country in the world. If they can work in U.S, it will be great to the development of both tech and economics. 

Large companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter need international STEM students, not because they are "cheap labors", actually, they are intelligent and hard working. Few American students choose STEM majors, because it's relatively more difficult to learn and less profitable than the other majors, such as doctors, lawyers and business school. Thus, international STEM students are perfect supply to these labor market. 

If the STEM OPT policy becomes only one year, it will be very difficult for any international students to find a job, and also, many companies will be worried about finding suitable workers. My major is Math&Statistics, I never heard of any of my American classmates could not find a job, there are plenty of available positions waiting there.

I know many negative comments here are from the anti-immigration groups. They are neither American STEM students, nor real company recruiters. If they were, they will know the extended STEM OPT is beneficial to the overall society and no harm to any American STEM students. I do suggest that they should focus on the millions of illegal emigrants, rather than the international students.
