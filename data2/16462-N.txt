END OPT PROGRAM: This program is a disgrace! This incentivizes U.S. companies to hire foreign STEM graduates over American STEM graduates. Employers are exempt from paying Social Security and Medicare taxes for the foreign workers. Employers can also pay those workers lower wages than American workers. 

US Census Bureau data show that roughly 11.4 million of 15 million Americans with STEM degrees aren't working in STEM fields. The crisis is not a lack of high-skilled workers, but a lack of high-skilled job openings. Employment site Bright.com found 4.08 American job candidates for every one electronics/engineering job listed as an H-1B position. Meanwhile, foreign guest workers account for one-third to one-half of all new IT hires.

According to the Government Accountability Office, about 100,000 foreign graduates a year are awarded OPT status
(about 20,000 with the STEM extension) and then go on to compete with similarly qualified American job seekers. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, the Center for Immigration Studies confirmed these numbers, finding that 497,274 OPT work authorizations were granted by DHS between 2009 and 2013, and that $4 billion of potential contributions to the
Social Security and Medicare trust funds were lost. Daniel Costa of the Economic Policy Institute argues that the OPT results in "lower wages by increasing the number of underpaid and exploited foreign workers in the {tech} industry."

The U.S. government should give priority to the interests of U.S. citizen workers over the interests of corporations or foreigner workers.
