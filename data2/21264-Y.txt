This proposal has my full support since overall it's what's best for the country and honestly I believe if an American STEM student has the same competence of completing the same level of tasks, they will only be given preference over international students, not being placed in a less advantaged situation.

Anyone from a STEM background knows that if you can do the job, you will get hired. International students are already less advantaged even if they work harder because providing them with sponsorship costs employers money and that's why employers like hiring Americans much better than international STEM students.

So at least give them a chance to be able to find a job in the very first place and I believe regardless of the nationalities if you're enough competent you can end up with the job you want.

I strongly support this approval.
