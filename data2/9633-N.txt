The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed a rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students and recent college graduates over American citizens. This program has never been authorized by Congress. Unless there is a directive by Congress for this, I do not believe that DHS should pursue this avenue. There is obviously potential for abuse by both the OPT employers and employees in this program. it should be scrapped until we have no American citizens available to be used to fill these positions.
