I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.
I'm an international student majoring in engineering here at US. One of the most important reasons that I chose US to do my further study is the OPT. I can accumulate working experience and apply my knowledge into the industry here. Once the OPT extension is cancelled, many of the US academies would lose a lot of international students. At the same time, most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Facebook will suffered a huge loss of human resource and profits.
On the other hand, the main area that needs OPT extension has no negative value on the US workers. For example, the high-tech companies hire a lot of international students but the banks or financial service companies would prefer more US workers, and here non-STEM students will not be influenced by the OPT extension.
I think that 12 months regular with 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT. Large companies always have long-term projects with two or more years. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers might need to quit the project in progress and this is also negative to the profit of the companies.
