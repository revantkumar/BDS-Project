Bjarne Lindberg I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT OPT extension for the following reasons: 

STEM OPT extension does not take jobs away from U.S. citizens, instead, it creates more and more jobs. The good contribution of OPT students will boost the economy by improving technology, science, finance and many other industries in the U.S. and a good economy with well-profiting companies will be a great source of creating more and better jobs. 

OPT extension also provide great benefits to the education system of United States, international students improve the diversity of the American culture and make American schools more attractive to all the talented students in the world wide range. 

OPT extension increases the chance of economic and technical communication among technology companies and countries, which will increase the opportunity of exporting high technology product from U.S. to the rest of the world.
