Yan Huang I support the proposal definitely! The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities to stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.! After all universities have spent so much effort to cultivating foreign students. This resources could be use to cultivate US students! It will be a loss and a waste just send foreign students home without letting them contribute to the US
