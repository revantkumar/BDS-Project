John Lee I strongly support STEM extension 

International students can spend more time in US to bring more benefits to companies in US. The demand of those high-tech companies in US is far more than the number of domestic STEM students. We do need those international students to do research and make contributions to US. 

Furthermore, STEM students can only use OPT to find major related jobs. So it is not reasonable to blame them for taking other american's job opportunities who are not in STEM field.
