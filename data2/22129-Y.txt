I encourage you to adopt this rule allowing students to extend their length of stay. Many professional programs require service beyond the classroom, and unless rules allow for this, students will complete their academic training without the necessary work training they need to truly prepare to work in their fields. I attend school with many international students and also teach them, and I know that the opportunity to train and work here is valuable to them and benefits the U.S. Therefore, please consider expanding their training and work opportunities so that future generations of students can also benefit.
