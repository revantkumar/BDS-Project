Zhen Han A large portion of the IT industry is intellectually funded by foreign students. Without them, the brain power that fuels the modern innovation in tech industry will greatly suffer. You can just do a head count in any of the large tech companies and you will see that foreign students (or workers that were F-1 students) take a big chunk. Without a proper regulation like the one being proposed, a big part of these workforce will be forced to leave US and join our competitors overseas. In fact, these foreign students do not take over the job opportunities from the US students. Tech companies pay attention to qualification rather than origin like most capitalist. Plus the supply from the US residents side is not enough for the great demand of the IT companies. Therefore, we should have a regulation like this one established to keep the edge that US is having in the technology side.
