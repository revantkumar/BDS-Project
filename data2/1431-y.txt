Saran R As you mention in the proposed rule, many scientific projects often take "years"to complete. This reason was used as justification for increasing the OPT STEM Extension period by 7 months to a total of 24 months. However, building off the premise that projects take "years" to complete, an extension of 7 months does not do much to address this outstanding problem.

As such, I request that you please consider increasing the STEM Extension period by a more substantial amount (a total of 5 years perhaps) to give STEM students the opportunity to meaningfully engage in and complete these projects.
