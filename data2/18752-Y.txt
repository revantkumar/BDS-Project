I don't agree with Berger's comment here.

"Virtual free greencard" - OPT is a non-immigrant working permission. It is not and will not become "green card". The goal is to allow the students to gain adequate experience related to their study. Even with the extension, the working permission still has an end.

"Harms American college students and destroys the careers of older American workers" - Positive competition is necessary for development, no matter whether it's in the academic environment or in the industries. People should be encourage to make progress instead of complaining about competition.

"Offering sensitive jobs to those with no allegiance to America" - If a job is actually sensitive, the employer will take the responsibility to screen the candidates before hiring them. I believe there are laws and regulations on the hiring process, especially for sensitive jobs. As far as I know, many sensitive jobs require citizenship of US.
