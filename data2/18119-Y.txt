Americans, especially the anti-immigrants groups, are casusing great loss of the united states by opposing these rules for prolonging the OPT of STEM international students.
Following losts will be caused:
1. the loss of highly ranked researchers and engineers. Every year many outstanding students graduated from both graduate and undergraduate school have to leave America because of failure in applying for H1B visa.
If the OPT time is prolonged, more opportunity will be created for these students to stay in America and CONTRIBUTE TO AMERICA.
2. the loss of money. Since colleges spend a lot of money on students as researching fees, the loss of students will cause waste of these fees (or to say, this is training researchers for other countries.)
3. the loss of fame. The oppositing activities destroy the appearance of America of welcoming foreigners and expose the SELFISH SIDE OF AMERICAN DREAM This harms the fame of America.
Basically, the anti-immigrants are only THINKING OF THEMSELVES.
