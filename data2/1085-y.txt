Xinu Ma The oppertunity of getting a job is never fair to international students, most of company only hire US citizens. The two year extension is desired to leave some time and opportunity to get diversity in the working place. No one will steal jobs from Americans, only people who can not find a job will blame on the regulation. The extension only allowed student stay for at most three years after graduate. As a young graduate the most creative three year in this country is not only a benefit for myself but also for the US citizens work with me. Why not leave more chance for the diversity?
