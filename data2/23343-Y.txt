I'm a foreign student pursuing my PhD in computer science at MIT. I strongly support Homeland Security Department's policy on improving and expanding the OPT program. The OPT program is a extremely valuable opportunity for me to apply my research in an industry environment and generate benefits to this country and this society which offered my PhD training. I believe the knowledge I gained in my PhD years has big potential value and the OPT program is an essential channel for me to give back this value here in US.
