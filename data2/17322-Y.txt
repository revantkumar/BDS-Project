As much as this rule helps immigrants, it also hurts American citizens.
The main problem to the low wages is importing of H-1 from foreign countries rather than focusing on the people being educated here (citizens or immigrants). There are no strict regulations on judgement of talent, salary compensation. As a result, with cheap competition from H-1 its tough to find jobs for citizens. The OPT extension is a small dent in this whole scenario. 

Tighten the H-1 from foreign countries, tighten the salary and benefits requirements and give first preference of H-1 to people studied here, then you have no need to provide OPT and avoid cheap labor and all these problems. 

People studied here are definitely worth giving a chance owing to their exposure and diversity and have proven advancing science and technology in different fields. 

In addition the majority of these problems arise from IT industry and real good people in other branches of science and technology doesn't even stand chance because of lack of visas with the infinite IT candidates competing for them. 

Also, if this OPT rule has to be aborted, it should not be this abrupt, as thousands of people will be in jeopardy. Giving certain time like 3 years (after three years there will be no issuance of OPTs anymore) so that current students also can plan for these change of rules. 

It is not fair to bring people by promising something else at front and change them in the middle.
