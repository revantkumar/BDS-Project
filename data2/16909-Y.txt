Totally Agree with the proposal.
For a company, to hire international students has to go through more sophisticated process and cost the enterprise more with the sponsorship with the risk of students having to go back to their homeland since they don't get H1B lottery later. It's already difficult for international students, so why do these hi-tech companies still hire international students? The only answer is that they ARE QUALIFIED for the position and can finish tasks efficiently. 
Don't let the gifted employees from all around world feel disappointed.
