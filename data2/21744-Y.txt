As an engineer I work a lot with those who have come from a foreign country and received education in the US. As a major workforce of technology industry, their contributions are undeniable. I think this is a great proposal that shows the US values, openness and equal opportunities. I don't see they get the jobs because they are 'cheaper', while they actually fill the huge manpower gap in STEM fields. This expanding policy would definitely benefit technology industries as well as education.
