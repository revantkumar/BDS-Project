I absolutely support this policy. It's very important for America to retain foreign talents and make full of their knowledge and expertise to serve this country. Many great contributions in this country were made by people who were foreign students, that's why this country is attractive and prosperous. No one is stealing jobs from Americans. You earn the job by improving yourself not by kicking someone better than you out of this country.
