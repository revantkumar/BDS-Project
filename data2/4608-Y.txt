I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT policy for the following reasons:
First, I think international students have boosted the economic development of America, they spend more money to study at university meanwhile in-state students gain education in a much lower tuition.
Second, if they don't have the opportunity to stay and work, America will lose more creative minds and competitiveness in the long run. STEM students are usually highly-educated ones who have outstanding professional knowledge, they could contribute significantly in their work.
Third, competition increases the overall output and everyone in the competition manages to improve oneself. Close the door just because of fearing of competition is not the solution.
