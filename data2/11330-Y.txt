If America lose more international talented engineers, America will face a huge problem in the international industry and business. If I am a boss, I would like to absorb Chinese experienced engineer to help me coordinate with the manufactures in China, or I will need some spanish engineer to fix problems if I am selling my products to South America. America citizens do not support my business well and they are working very undisciplined and I prefer the international students who are working hard and effective and less paid. Also, they will not only help our businesses and with their help we can increase our national economy.
