I strongly support the DHS for expanding training opportunities for F-1 students. I believe this is the right thing to do, and will not only benefit the foreign students, but also the local organizations.

I don't understand why people are blaming foreign student for taking away jobs for the local citizens. It doesn't make any sense. Normally companies would prefer to hire local worker in order to avoid a lot of trouble trying to file an H1B or a green card for a foreign worker, in this case, the only reason they hire foreigners is because foreigners are better. More sophisticated worker is what companies are looking for, I don't think it has anything to do with F-1 students.
