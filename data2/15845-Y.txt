I strongly SUPPORT the opt extension.

Most engineering jobs need around 1 year to train newbies before they can make any real contribution. Thousands of people who just finish their training have to leave the US without this opt extension. It is a big waste of money and resource, and a big lost for the companies and the US.

It doesn't make any sense to say we foreign students steal jobs from american people. There are only a small fraction of companies hiring foreigners. Please look at the job fair of any college. Lots of companies ONLY HIRE citizens. And those companies which accept foreigners ALSO HIRE citizens. Take my own experience as an example, when I was looking for an internship, Intel told me, who won the Intel 2H'2012 Excellent Intern in China, "Sorry, we only want citizen at this time." Foreign students CREATE a lot of job in american. Every foreign student needs to spend money on higher tuition, foods, housing and health care. When relatives and friends visit us, it will bring more power to consume in the US. To meet the need of consuming, the market offers more job opportunities.
