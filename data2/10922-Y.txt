I don't why there are so many opposing voices. I have seen a lot of people saying that international students have stolen their jobs. How does this happen? Maybe they should have the nepotism as the international students does.

I am in support of the opt extension. American people should get stress from international students. Besides, young people should improve themselves instead of accusing other people of being outstanding.

There is the present situation where young people are not able to concentrate on improving themselves, exclaiming they are not fair treated. It's a high time to explain what fair is to them.
