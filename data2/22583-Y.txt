I strongly support this proposal.

First, it is American spirit that demands equal chance for the development of everybody. Most of international students come to the USA for better chance of development. This proposal will encourage increasing talent young people come here.

Second, the international students such as Chinese are good at STEM field and can make great contributions to the USA. Giving them more working chance is helpful for the USA to improve economy.

Thank you.
