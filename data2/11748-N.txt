I cannot understand why our " legal " citizens would allow their "elected officials" to cause our 'legal' American students to be undercut by foreign students !
It seems to me that those "Training Opportunities' should be afforded to our own legal children !
What the hell are we thinking ?
TRAIN OUR OWN CHILDREN !!!
