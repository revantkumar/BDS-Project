I support this proposal, because it benefits both students and development of America for the following reasons:
1. The extension will give students more opportunities to combine their knowledge from university with practice in career, it will benefit the growth of those ambient students who wanna be better and better and devote to their university and our society.
2. It will greatly promote the development of America in scientific and economic fields. As we all know, quantity of scientists who made huge contribution to America were international STEM students or learners. With the power those person, the technology of America lead the latest tech all around the world, but what will it be if government refuse this proposal? Obviously, America's global effect in scientific field will be greatly reduced because the serious loss of those future excellent engineers and scientists. On the other hand, the extension of OPT will activate the economy of America. For one thing, the industry related to scientific and engineering like architect, automobile, electronics,etc.. will thrive. Also, there would be more international student being pleased to get education in America, those students' education fee and living cost brought by this also cannot be ignored.
3. It would make the diplomatic of America be more smooth. Why? Because those students come from other countries. Since the proposal provides more opportunities to those students, which also benefit the development of their homeland countries, correspondingly, those countries would prefer to cooperate with United States in politic communication and cooperations.
Taking those reasons into consideration, the proposal is a mutual benefit thing which is good for both America and those STEM students.
