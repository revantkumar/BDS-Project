Please provide proof for your argument 
"OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013;"
Because when I Google that argument, the first related story is:
"430,000 Lost Jobs to Illegal Aliens Between 2009-2013. Thanks go to Obama"

OPT students are NOT illegal aliens. You cannot blame honest law-abiding people for the harm caused by criminals. Therefore that argument is not valid unless you can provide a reliable source. Otherwise I can claim:
Anti-immigration organizations denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013
Anti-immigration organizations wasted $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
