This rule finally fixes the problems associated with the OPT program. On one side it gives international students the opportunity to work in the US while applying for regular employment VISA H1B and on the other side forces the employers to provide proofs that the international employee is hired at a standard salary level, with no tax exemptions, like any other US employee. I believe this is the key point as it eliminates the idea of unfair competition towards US citizens. Really well done and keep pushing to implement the new rule before February 12th.
