I am in support of the OPT extension. This is not for my own good, but for the very good of the society of america. So what good can it do to US? The most significant power of US is undoubtably its advanced science and technology, and I am very convinced that this advancement comes from not only the US citizens but also the so many scientists and engineers from all over the world. For example, we all know that computer science is one of the most important science subjects. And look at the topmost publications on computer science conferences and journals, the number of foreign researchers outnumber the original US citizens drastically, and a major part of them are exactly working in the US when doing those researches. So what if the OPT extension is cancelled? First, lots of them will lose the interest in coming to the US, as it would be so hard to create real values in such a short period of time. Second, lots of them will lose the opportunity to contribute to the US even if they want to. 

To achieve the best interest of america, we need to absorb every talent from all over the world. And closing the door to all those talents? That's what happened to China two centuries ago, and that surely means the end of a nation.
