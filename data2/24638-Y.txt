I support the proposal of OPT extension. Here are two reasons worth your reading and considering. 

International students help U.S develop faster. We all know talented people are the most powerful engine to push a country forward. In my country, the most excellent undergraduate students are applying for American universities to study for their master or doctoral degrees. After several years learning and training in great schools here, they must be more competent to work in industry or academy. Extension OPT helps them to work here longer and make more contribution to U.S. and even to the world. 

Extension OPT does not hamper U.S. citizens opportunities of finding jobs. Because our international students probably get the jobs other U.S. citizens dont suit. Furthermore, nearly all the companies give the U.S. citizens priorities. It is less likely to prevent U.S. citizens from getting a job.
