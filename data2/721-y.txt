Jane Hu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Following are the reasons:

1. The STEM students have got great education from universities in the U.S. I think the government should make full use of the knowledge the student earned and let them make contribution to the U.S.

2. The competition between international students and native student does exist, but it is not the bad thing at all. Instead, the competition could stimulate the overall level of students, and keep the U.S. as the leading country at the aspects of economy, 
technology, etc. We have to notice that most jobs for STEM students are those which are not very suitable for Americans. STEM students ARE NOT taking away job opportunities from native Americans!

3. U.S. prides itself for being the most diverse country. Many celebrities of different origins, who were international students before, have made huge contributions to the U.S. I don't think U.S. government wants to lose people like these.
