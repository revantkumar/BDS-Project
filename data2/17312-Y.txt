As I rememmber that American is a country of freedom, it's a country full of opportunity.

You give intertional students the right to study, you also have to give they the right the pratice what they have study. 

You give intertional students the right to spent vast money in US, you also have to give they the right to learn the real skill for living.

So, please let see the american spirit again.
