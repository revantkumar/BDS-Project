Lin Zong I totally favor this rule since it is not international students' fault that some Americans are unemloyed. We compete with American domestic students in a already disadvantageous stage and only those extremely competitive students could stay in U.S. and work for a year or two. This rule is what those hardworking and talented and well-qualified students deserve.
