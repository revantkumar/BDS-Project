I support this rule for these reasons for these reasons.

1. The STEM students are not a big portion among US students, and it doesn't help that more Americans can find jobs by stopping this rule. I don't think most of Americans who cannot find a job nowadays are STEM majors. 
2. The STEM jobs needs people who are well educated. As far as I know, any company will hire American STEM students first if the international students are not qualified. Otherwise, they should hire the person who can contribute more, and this rule can keep the person work longer for the company and make profits for the nation.
3. It can help US to attract high-level students from all over the world who are brilliant and dependable for the development of this country.
