Longhui Ren I am currently an international student at Iowa, and I support this policy. This policy attract more talented students all around the world to come to study in U.S. and provide more opportunities for them to work here in U.S. We all know that intelligence is the most important source in 21st Century, and this policy would hep America to recruit most talented students all around the world and help they start to work in U.S. which could help America to keep leading the trend in technology and other developments. Therefore, this policy would actually help America.
