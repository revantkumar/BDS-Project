I have several comments about the proposal to modify the OPT program.

These changes will put American workers at a distinct disadvantage to foreign students. The proposed changes will allow employers to avoid payroll taxes by treating them as interns,and will give employers control over OPT interns by limiting their ability to change jobs within the U.S. or to unionize. Under these conditions, any profit-motivated employer will have irresistible incentive to skip over American workers in favor of foreign graduates. 

In addition, this change will artificially inflate the labor pool for these technical positions, thus dampening any potential increase in wages for American technical workers. 

I do not understand why some government agencies express concern about unemployment, while this agency promotes a regulation that will glut the labor market.

On a more general level, it seems literally immoral to work against the interests of individual Americans, who were told that a "STEM" education would provide a stable careeer, in order to benefit foreign workers and the corporations who would like to avoid paying a fair market wage. 

We have given away our manufacturing jobs to foreign competition and many domestic jobs to immigrants, often with glib encouragement for the displaced citizens to pursue more education to move to "better" jobs. Now that STEM jobs are going to foreigners, what is the next proposal to address unemployment among Americans?
