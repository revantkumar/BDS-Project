I strongly support this new rule.

As a staff software engineer, my team is trying to hire new employee since many employee left for other opportunities. We interview lots of candidates. About 80% are USA citizens. However, most of them are not qualified. I can not give them the offer. I can't give the future of my team to them. Otherwise, we will lose money! Fortunately, I interview some excellent new graduates. Even though they are fresh and do not have much experience about our business. They are really smart and very good candidates for computer science.

I talked to them in person. They are all OPT student and want to work in USA to get some experience. They prefer to go back to China after 2-3 experience in USA.
