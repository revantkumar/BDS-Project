Yongquan Lu I support the expanded provisions for support for F-1 OPT workers under the new rule. I think that this will help US companies better attract and retain STEM talent. If you look at the realities of the marketplace right now (openings everywhere, every company recruiting), it is misleading to claim that such a rule will reduce the number of jobs for American citizens.
