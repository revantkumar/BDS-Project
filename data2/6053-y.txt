Anonymous I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I would love to contribute to Innovation and American Economy. The proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule will help us make a more advanced America. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
