DHS has proposed, without Congressional oversight, to offer incentives to corporations with HB-1 visas. This is corporate welfare and very detrimental to young Americans who are seeking work. If this administration had its way, all Americans would not be working and ALL jobs would be going to legal and illegals immigrants. This must stop!
