Blocking smart brains and efficient labors by races and nationality is never what makes a country like U.S. stronger. U.S. from the very beginning was built by welcoming those who were brave enough to board the north America regardless the ethics and races. 
The first time I saw angry and hopeless homeless and beggars in U.S., I was so surprised that they can still afford a doze of beers beers and raise a dog. On the other hand, so many smart students are studying and working so hard, making great contributions to the country and taking the responsibility they should not take. It is unfair. I am not a STEM student. But I have very conflicting feeling. Approving the rule will attract more well-educated students to U.S., which is a great loss to my own country. But rejecting the rule will be too unfair and desperate for those who are trying so hard. I just hope for more equal opportunities and respect for the young generations.
