Notice as you read through these comments, the ones most for this horrible proposal have very foreign sounding names. OF COURSE THEY WANT THIS EXTENDED! 

Sorry, but as a former electrical engineer whose career was ended by this nonsense, I object. The H1B/OPT/L! and related visa programs need to be killed. They have killed many careers to the benefit of the cheap labor lobby. How about putting American workers ahead of corporate profits for once?
