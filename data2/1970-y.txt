Xie Chen I am on OPT and I pay a the taxes working here. I have a MS and it took my company 9 months to find me. I urge people here to emphasize the following facts when they post comments to show how those negative comments are wrong:

1. Most STEM students pay social security taxes
2. We don't accept lower wages or lower benefits( it is against the law and the OPT rule)
3. In most cases hiring a foreign national costs more money to the corporations as they have to take care of their visa application fees(H1B-GREEN CARD etc...) and attorney costs
4. There are many different engineering and science fields OPT holders get hired such as chemistry, biological-genetic development, materials or mechanical engineering .... NOT JUST IT
5. If there is no OPT program most talented foreign students in advanced degree levels will go to other countries and this will dramatically affect the US university research
6. Training and educating US citizens in STEM field is a very good thing. But if they try to exclude the students-researchers-professors from the US universities that would lead to a big disaster. US citizens can be smart and trainable but having a high level competition and talent pool in US universities is what makes it the best in the world.
7. As a result of 6th fact US universities would eventually become mediocre and US science and technology field would collapse
8. STEM jobs are not like union labor jobs. There is NO PREDETERMINED NUMBER OF JOBS. High efficiency, innovations, developments will lead to more jobs and it is a win-win for everyone. Talent and completion is the most important thing.
9. If you exclude talented foreign nationals who are already integrated to the system that means you do not want any kind of immigration.
