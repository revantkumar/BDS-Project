The proposed rule on the part of the Dept. of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training Program is bad for America as it denies those Americans who are equally qualified to fill positions. The Government Accountability Office issued a report last year finding that the OPT program was inefficient and that DHS wasn't adequately overseeing it. The OPT program was intended as a temporary program for students to help their countries upon returning home but instead has become a means for participants to stay in the U.S. longer, undercutting Americans who need jobs. The proposed rule gives U.S. corporations and universities the means to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination while denying American workers the same benefit of OPT. America needs to put Americans first by not kowtowing to the DHS and large corporations, who find this to be a lucrative program for hiring foreign workers at lower wages. If there is a shortage of workers in the technical and science sectors, then special monitoring programs should be equally available to Americans. America can't afford to spend billions on foreigners when a labor pool of Americans equally qualified already exists.
