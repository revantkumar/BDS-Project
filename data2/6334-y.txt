If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them.

This suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
