I strongly support this proposal. As an international student, we received the same education and finished the same work as Native Americans in university. I believe we should have an equal opportunity to contribute in company for this country. United States is a global leading country, and one of the reason is that a lot of talents from outside this country choose to stay here and contribute what they learn. STEM field major sure demands much more labor. I believe it's a good choice to pass this proposal.
