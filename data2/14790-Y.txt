I strongly supported this rule for the following reasons:

Most of F-1 Nonimmigrant students paid lots of tuition fee to achieve a degree in US. It's unfair to give them a super short period to get trained in industry. Improved and expanded OPT will allow them to get a better training and to make contribution in the company or academia in US.

One year OPT is too short for both the employer and F-1 nonimmigrant student. For students with STEM major, one year training is too short 'cause lots of skills in these area require long time to learn. Thus an improved and extended OPT is necessary for them.
