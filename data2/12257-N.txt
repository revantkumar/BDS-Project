The new OPT rules incentivize American companies to not hire American workers. This is yet another attack on the job prospects of American students graduating from college. Also since the OPT workers are technically students employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these workers. This is another attempt to get around the H-1B visa limits. The American middle class is under attack and this rule is an example of this. Please strengthen rules that encourage businesses to hire American citizens first before hiring cheap foreign labor.
