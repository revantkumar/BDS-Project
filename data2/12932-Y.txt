I strongly support the proposal. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from US universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the US. As far as I know, IT companies are making huge contribution to US and they pay significant amount of tax each year which benefits all the US citizens. These companies hire international students because there are no US citizens suitable for these positions. Therefore, it's obvious that there is no competition between international students and US citizens, not to mention international students are takes job opportunities from US citizens. If international students are not allowed to keep working in US, I believe it'll be a tremendous loss to a lot of companies as they're unable to find suitable people for these positions and thus the US economy. Based on above, I strongly support the proposal.
