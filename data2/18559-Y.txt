The extension of OPT is definite a great approach for the prosperity of America's Economy. During the past decades, highly educated immigrants have demonstrated their strong talent in technology and entrepreneurship. A majority of the tech leaders in Silicon valley are from abroad.

The survival of these immigrants corresponds to a natural rule, that is, only the suited can survive. The equal opportunity of employment has always been advocated of American. And they demonstrated their supreme capability to bring growth to companies here.

Their success also benefits the thrive of American. The America is made up of immigrants herself. She attracts brilliant foreigners, make them new American. Only the elite ones actually stay. And they turn out to be backbones of this country.

The US has always been advocating diversity and liberty. The extension of STEM OPT actually reflects these spirits. We should really cheer for this policy and expect it to be finally carried out.
