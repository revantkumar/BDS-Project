John Smith I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The students enjoy the excellent education resource of the US. We want to have them contribute their skills back to the US

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. US has always been an immigration country, and many great achievements were made by foreign-born people.

3. We don't want the highly skilled people to work abroad. Especially in the era of globalization, if we push highly skilled students out, they will be employed by foreign companies, and compete and get jobs out of US.
