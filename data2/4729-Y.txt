I strongly believe OPT extension is beneficial to United States.

Looking at the big companies in Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook, Twitter, their prosperity are bases on highly based on the work of foreign workers. Many many americans are not able to do such a heavy job and are not willing to study STEM majors. That is why these companies have to hire foreign labors. Without these experienced experts, US will definitely lose the leader power of economy, especially in industry field.

Also, to be honest, if the OPT extension is permitted, more thousands of foreign students will choose United States for their further education. This will benefits the nation for tuitions earning, house renting and even developing of public transportation. Especially for cities with large amount universities, such as New York, LA and Pittsburgh. For example, in Pittsburgh, foreign students in CMU and Pittsburgh University contributes to a very large portion of consumption of the whole city. I strongly believe without them, this city cannot be prosperous like now.
