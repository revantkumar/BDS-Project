I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, many achieving people in the U.S. history started as a immigrant student.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. The competition will make the U.S. stronger just as the song says what doesn't kill only makes you stronger.
