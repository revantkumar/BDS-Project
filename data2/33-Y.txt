I fully support the STEM extension new policy. Stop saying let these foreigners get out of our country! Look at our ancestors, some of them came from Germany, some came from France, some came from Asian countries. But they loved America so much and worked together thus we can have today's USA in the world. International STEM students that I met are hard-working, smart. And most importantly, they are making contribution to our country. Can you imagine how difficult when you are living abroad? They speak our language, and contribute to our economy. I do not think it is easy for them to receive an offer from any companies. The company needs to sponsor these STEM students first. We should believe our companies are not fools. They definitely will consider U.S. born citizens first without doubt. So why they still send out offers to these international students in STEM? Very simple, because we do NEED them. OPT 24months extension will have a great effect on the development of USA. I strongly hope the rule can be approved!!!
