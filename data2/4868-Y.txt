I strongly support this rule. International students are making great contribution to the scientific development these years in this country. I work in a national lab with many excellent students coming from everywhere around the world:China,India,Russia....From my point of view, they are more talented and diligent than most Americans working in my lab. I think we should give these students more opportunities to stay and work for our country. Also this policy will attract more intelligent students coming here to study, and hence improve the US education.
