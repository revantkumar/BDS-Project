James Xu I think this is a great idea to expand OPT to 24 months. The foreign students work hard, take their jobs seriously, and they contribute a lot on the development of economy and technology. Now, some of the "US citizens" claim that the government should not give those jobs to foreigners. But, remember that most of these "citizens" come from families that originated from other countries. So, when their NON-CITIZEN ancestors were given the opportunities to work and live in US, why the foreign students cannot have same right today? Those "US citizens" who object this regulation just hope there is no one compete with them, so that they do not need to work hard but still get paid more.
