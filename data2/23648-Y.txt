I sincerely support the STEM Extension rule. Foreign students are coming to united states to get better education and also paying huge tuition for these reputed universities to make our lives better. If there is no opportunity to work after the graduation, that is very disappointing for us. We are not taking anybody's job, there is a wrong notion that we are stealing the jobs. Having said this, not everybody gets the job here easily. Almost 90% of the companies asks for citizenship before even considering the job application. This proves how difficult to get a job in US for foreigners, we are always the last priority. Only the bright students gets the job. Even if all the students work, there is still a huge requirement in tech industries.

We are not stealing the jobs, We are helping the economy to grow and making the United States a better place in the world.
