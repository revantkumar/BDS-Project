I highly support the decision to extend OPT. In fact, I am an international student in engineering who works in silicon valley, and if this act is revoked I would be forced to leave, change my family location and a myriad of other issues. These problems are the same among my international friends and this is a basic right for the people who are graduating. 

I hope the White House can take this to the highest level of consideration and really consider the totality of the population here who are making important contribution to the future of the U.S economy.
