As an international student, I sincerely appreciate of the efforts DHS has put into this codified rule, I have just secured an appointment carrying out leading research in health care and rehabilitation based on latest technologies. Without OPT and extension for us STEM students, it would be rather difficult for this and many alike research plans to expand and sustain whatsoever. That I heart-fully request this rule to be approved by the next February. Thank you in advance for your consideration!
