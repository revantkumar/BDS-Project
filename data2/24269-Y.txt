This is not a policy that place international students benefit over Americans. America should be a land where hard work pays off. A foreigner still have a lot of restrictions to be hired in the US. Of course a country will ensure the benefits of its own citizens. And I believe the US government is doing the right thing to extend the OPT period. The extension can attract a lot of international students who will bring a lot of money to the universities. This would eventually benefit US citizens. Those who lose your job, or struggle to find a job, please read the proposal before you comment. Do you even have a STEM degree with decent knowledge and quality? Pointing fingers won't make your life better. Even if there are not foreign students in the market, who are not qualified still cannot find a job.
