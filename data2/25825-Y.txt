I strongly support the proposal that the STEM student will have a 24-month OPT extension for the following reasons:

As a working person in engineering field, I would like to say that according to current condition, we really have comparatively enough positions for both native and international students, which indicates that terminating the extension policy and block them from the positions is not appropriate. The competition between native and international students is not that serious. To be honest, I dont think the people out of work because of international students will get a job even if the extension policy is terminated.

At the same time, the extension policy is actually helping the job market: the extension policy will attract a great number of students from all around the world to come to the US for higher education, they live in America, paying for their tuition fee and make other payments, which is actually boosting the nations economy and creating more job opportunities. Creating jobs is much better than blocking other people from entering the job market considering solving the work problem.

Finally, hiring international students is also beneficial to the employers: they are usually cheaper than natives, the employers are paying less and will have more gross income.
