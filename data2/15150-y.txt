Manoj Rajaure I strongly support the proposed bill about expanding OPT extension put forth by DHS. I have been in the United States for more than 10 years (legally), finishing my undergraduate and PhD degree from one of the nation's best University. During my stay in the US, I have worked very hard to achieve an American dream that many don't get the opportunity for. Now that I am qualified as a research scientist and my forthcoming research revolves around the development of strategies to combat some of the deadliest diseases caused by antibiotic resistant bugs, I would be very disappointed to go back home with no such platform for research so that I could contribute back to serve the humankind. When America is at the frontier to confront such global challenges to stop outbreak of deadliest diseases and many international student across the STEM related program are embracing these challenges as their own challenge, committing themselves heavily as a workhorse in the research industry, it would be a great loss for the United States to send such talented international students back home. Everyone knows this is the fact. The United States also needs to be aware of the fact that many postdocs are now seeking opportunity in countries like Singapore, China, India, Dubai, or Australia rather than in America due to the fact that postdocs are paid well in those countries compare to here. After spending so much dollars in training these high skilled professional, many being international students, it would be a lose-lose situation for America if the government does not provide attractive legal grounds to make them stay in this country. Therefore, I am very optimistic that the proposed bill put forward by DHS about expanding the OPT extension program to 24 months will become effective soon without creating any chaos among F-1 students by forcing them to abandon their ongoing work that is worth of enormous value.
