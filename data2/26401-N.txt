I am writing to express my strong opposition to the DHS proposal to expand the Optional Practical Training program. As I understand it, this program would let high tech companies hire foreign students for up to three years to avoid paying company payroll taxes. This would create an incentive to hire foreign student over their qualified American counterparts (essentially, an unfair subsidy to put foreign workers over American workers). Clearly, this would benefit the bottom lines of those companies, but continue to drive up unemployment, under employment in among citizens, as well ad driving down wages and our standard of living. In addition, this proposal would also violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. 

This nation already has a massive problem with recent college graduates finding meaningful employment that can help them pay down record amounts of student loan debt.

As a 53 old engineer, I urge you to reject this proposed program that is a threat to all American tech worlers. This program makes a problem that is already endemic (unemployment and under employment for citizens in the tech sector), and makes it far worse.

Please....represent the interests of citizen over corporations seeing to make even larger profits and oppose the Optional Practical Training program being proposed by DHS.

Feel free to call me at 309-282-6342 if you would like any further input or clarification. Time to represent citizens!!
