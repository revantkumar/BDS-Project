This policy would greatly benefit the United States. 
A lot of countries like China, India are opposing this proposal because they always wanted those who were educated in the US to come back and help their own country grow. Abroad students have helped them building Atom Bombs. Do you really want those situations to happen again?
It would be insane if we just banish those who were educated by our best resources and work for other countries. The wise choice would be making them work for the US and be the tax payers.
