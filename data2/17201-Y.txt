I would like to support this policy because it will directly benefit international students and technology companies. It might also have positive effects on US students in STEM and the universities. 

OPT doesnt shut the door for American citizens in STEM jobs. It only provides an opportunity for international students on the job market. Improving OPT with 24 months extension provides two more opportunities for international students to win H1B lottery. In this situation, the companies will be able to select their employees based on the talents of the candidates instead of where they were born. It will increase the pool of resources on the job market and bring positive competitions, which will encourage both international and American students to work hard to have a dream job.

Moreover, universities spend lots of resources and funding to educate students, especially the graduated students regardless of their nationalities. International students are important for the diversity of universities. Expanding OPT will attract more talents all around the world to US for education. 

The extension is a great idea. I look forward to hearing it in action.

Sincerely,
Gang Shao
