Charlie Lee I vote yes for this new OPT extension rule. 

I learned a lot from the university, but what I learned was still different from what companies are really using. Enough extra practical training is necessary. However, 12-months may not enough for foreign students to gain enough work experience. Besides the time spent in looking for a job and a few months spent in new graduate training, only a few months left for foreign students to gain real industrial experience. Less real industrial experience makes U.S. higher education less competitive. In addition, a short practical training is not good for the companies as well, since less time means less contribution to the company, which is less worthwhile for the company, especially after they spend a lot in finding a ideal employee.
