Michael Vaughan I strongly support this rule and I have so many reasons for everyone to support this rule.

I am an American citizen working as a technology manager with one of the leading software company. 80% people in our research team are STEM graduates across the world. In our technology team we have 50% STEM graduates. In our development team we have 40% international STEM graduates. If this rule is not issued then all this people have to go back to their country. Because of this we have to shut down our company and if that happens then around 3000 American citizens working in our company are going to loose their jobs. 

The same thing will happen in around 10,000 tech companies in all over USA. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In face because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with our without degree in STEM field. I have seen so many comments saying that this rule is taking away jobs from stem degree graduates in USA but it is totally wrong. I request all those guys to go and check their figures. Just go online and check number of job openings for engineers in companies like Microsoft, Amazon, google, facebook, Yahoo, Bloomberg etc. All these jobs are created because all this companies are growing really really fast and the reason these companies are growing because they have international STEM graduates in their team.

STEM graduates are creating more and more jobs for everyone. Please issue this rule so that they can stay longer in this country and contribute towards growth of this country
