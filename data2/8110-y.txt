JUN WANG I am an international student from China. I graduated from a top rank Canadian University and I came to the states to pursuit Master degree(stem degree) from an Ivey league school because I know I can get 29 months of legal status to work in the states. I gave up 3 year working permit from Canada. It is very unfair for those who come to the states knowing that they can work for 29 months and after they spend thousands of dollar they cannot get to work no more.
