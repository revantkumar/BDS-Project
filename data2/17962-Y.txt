I personally support this policy to be approved because it will give more opportunities for international student to work in the United Stated. Also it will help the situation with low lottery rate for H1B. In addition, it will bring more labor force for the U.S. because most STEM students are related to IT, Engineering and this kind of major which is very significant considering to developing the U.S. Once STEM students only have one-year OPT period, they have to go back to their home country, and they cannot make any further contribution based on their knowledge to the United States.
