I support the proposal of extension of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students. There should be no discrimination for recruiting native or international students for positions related to science, technology, as well engineering. In most cases, international, especially Asian students are featured with much stronger knowledge than native people.
