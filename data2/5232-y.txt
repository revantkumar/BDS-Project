Lu Su I strongly support this proposal for international student. 

First of all, US markets need more STEM talents than expected. According to U.S News(Report: STEM Job Market Much Larger Than Previously Reported:http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2014/02/05/report-stem-job-market-much-larger-than-previously-reported), the new analysis of millions of job postings found there were 5.7 million openings in STEM fields in 2013, 4.4 million of which required at least a bachelor's degree and 2.3 million of which were entry-level jobs that call for less than two years of experience. Currently, international students are the essential force in STEM jobs markets. They make a huge contributions to technology growth and economic recovery after 2008. At this point, expanding OPT STEM rule to 24 months is a really good encouragement for international students working in STEM area. Without this 24 months, international student in STEM area only have 12 months. As a result, companies are more difficult to find superior talents. As a long term, it will impede economic growth. 

Second, expanding OPT STEM rule won't hurt residences' work opportunities. Based on the proposal, DHS provides a completed and strict rules to define international students using OPT working in US. In proposal, student's position and responsibilities must related to his study area. Currently, there are not so many local students studying STEM area. Therefore, allowing OPT EXTENSION won't decrease residences' chance.
