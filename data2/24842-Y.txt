I am a Professor of Geophysics.

Yes, most of you probably have no idea what geophysics is. The reality in our department is most of undergrads are Americans, while most of our graduate students (MS and PHD) are foreigners. 

Not that I do not try to recruit our American students, they are simply not interested in obtaining an advanced degree in geophysics. When most of them graduate with a BS, they can easily get a job and start making $100k a year. Of course, most of them decide to join the workforce. 

The only choice I have is to admit foreign students, otherwise this discipline is about to be history. This is true across the country in the geoscience field. Science has no border. If our American students do not care enough to make advances in the scientific field, we should not forbid others that are willing.

Discouraging foreign students will be catastrophic to our discipline. And my students are very worried.

I strongly support the OPT program.
