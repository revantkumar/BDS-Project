I strongly SUPPORT this proposal since it will foster the development of economy without sacrificing the welfare of local residents. First, providing working opportunities for students who have high technical skills is beneficial for the development of US economy. If you look at the technology industry, you will discover how many foreign students have promoted its development and breakthrough. Secondly, most companies claim diversity is a significant part of the culture. Adding more foreign STEM majors will introduce some new perspectives. Third, the competition between US students and foreign students is not a issue here. If average candidates are more capable than before, then this will encourage everyone to work hard in order to qualify a job opportunity. Therefore, those opportunities won't be wasted by people who lack of skills. If anyone is scared by this, why don't just make yourself stronger instead of making your competitors disappear? Additionally, based on my experience, for most of foreign students, the main reasons to work here include obtaining work experience in a new environment. Ultimately they want to go back to their homelands and reunion with their families and friends. People who are worried about the deterioration of citizenship values should propose to send back illegal immigrants rather than attack foreigners with true talents.

To sum up, it's necessary to approve and launch this proposal immediately in order to introduce more talents to create values for the society.
