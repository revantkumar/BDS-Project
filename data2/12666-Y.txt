I am in the favor of the DHSs proposed rule that would expand the OPT program. This expansion would financially supporting US's colleges as well as high tech companies, which would be a benefit for all the citizens. Graduates from STEM help USs technology to be the leader in the world; the benefit they bring is much significant than the lost causing by incentives for hiring them. If the rule failed, huge amount of foreign technical worker would be leaving, but US doesnt have enough people to fill the gap, development of technology may bog down for an uncertain of period, economy would be impacted for sure.
