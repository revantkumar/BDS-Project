Giving more opportunities for US trained STEM international students to stay and work for US, Who would reject that if they are aiming for the best interest of US?
They will make more jobs rather than just filling up the job openings because they are only allowed to work in the STEM field. Well,"accidentally",that's the field of if you make some progress and tons of new product will waiting in a line to be invented, modified and manufactured. Those following invention and manufacture will provide more jobs to not only in the STEM field but also sales, consumers, etc..
This is the kind of right decision should be make for any country that's aiming for a better future.
