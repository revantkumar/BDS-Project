If opt got extension, more and more foreigners will use US resources. Especially those hi tech majors, they will learn many technologies from US companies after few yrs working in US, even if they back to their own country after OPT, they will bring( steal) those technologies to their countries. So in the long run, the US companies will have more and more competitors, and more and more pressure to grow up and contributes to US, US citizens will also lose confidence to US companies, so they may work for foreign companies instead. Then US economy goes down because lose of labor. 
On the other hand, if OPT cancelled, this will courage more and more citizens and residents study harder in technology and science, because hi tech companies usually give higher salaries. And since stay in US is harder, those foreigners who have the abilities stay must have much better skills and culture fit in US. They will also feel graceful to stay and work harder for US companies . All of these will increase US economy and GDPs. 
US shouldn't extend OPT in order to get more hi tech employees, because more population brings more troubles as well, those troubles is more terrible than lack of hi tech employees. Instead, US'd better to refine those foreigner employees. If only few of them can stay, then the quality of H1s will increase. Only increase the quantity of employees will decrease US economy and bring burden to US government. 
So overall, canceling OPT has much more benefits to US economy and governments.
