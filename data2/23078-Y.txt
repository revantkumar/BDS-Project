I support this regulation. The reasons is as following:
One of the most important factors that USA has top high-tech companies which have brightest elites in the world. Some people fight against the regulation because they think that too many immigrants will lower the wages of employees. However this is not the case. Almost every company is willing to pay for a talented people. There are too few rather than too many talents to support this industry. Given the current H1B situation, many talented people are forced to leave the country when they cannot have H1B visa. How can those high tech companies continue to be advanced if they can't hire the most talented people? These people are NEEDED for high tech industry. Therefore I will strongly support this rule.
