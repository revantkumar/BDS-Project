DHS is now trying to extend the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program for up to 36 months even though a federal judge, 
in the case of "WashTech vs. DHS", struck down the 2008 OPT program extension from 12 to 29 months. The Obama 
administration's disregard for existing law is outrageous and dangerous. 
The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of American STEM graduates by increasing the labor pool for American tech 
jobs by hundreds of thousands of foreign STEM degree-holders who would remain in this country on their student visas. The 
OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around the limits on H-1B visas.
