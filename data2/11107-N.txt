Unfortunately, three Presidents from two Parties have gone around Congress to take good jobs out of reach of American college graduates. Isn't it time to tell both political establishments to stop? American graduates from American universities finish school with huge debts and then cannot find jobs! Stop this illegal practice NOW!
