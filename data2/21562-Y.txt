Firstly thanks very much for this proposal.
As an international student in a STEM program now, I believe the expanding of Training Opportunity will benefit both the U.S. and ourselves. The students in STEM contains math, science or engineering skills which are highly demanded by different industries in the U.S.. There are huge number of postitions for people who want to enter in these areas, thus more nonimmigrant students spending some more time working here as internship after graduation will definitely not threat the job opportunities of the local residents. In contrast, with more STEM students make contribution to the development of the U.S., there will be more other kinds of working opportunities coming out for the U.S. citizens. To keep U.S. with the highest tech&science&business development speed, it should not be a good plan to refuse the tremendous help from nonimmigrant STEM students. 
Apparently, the demand of the skills is the reason why we can get training opportunity here. We are not bad people, we are trying our best to make the U.S. better, just the same as the formal citizens
