Its widely known there is no true shortage of Tech workers in the US. In fact a 2013 study from the EPI found proved there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors. The true intent of this plan is to suppress wages in tech-related fields.

Its bad enough today with many companies abusing {H-1B} to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring US citizens at prevailing US wages - especially in software or tech areas. As a female tech worker over 50, in the business for well over 20 years, I know this first hand - have had my own and others jobs outsourced, my own wages reduced. 

This plan will ensure foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need and categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes which provides an unfair incentive for companies to hire them. 

This rule will exasperate a bad situation - it is open to every foreign person in the world, seeking the cheapest, not the brightest. It is an employment program for and only for foreign students - U.S. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM. 

That is OBSCENE!
