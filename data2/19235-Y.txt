I strongly support the STEM OPT Extension for the following reasons:

1. If this proposal is not approved, U.S could lose up to 350,000 (There are about 1 million international students enrolled in U.S colleges, 35% are pursuing degree in STEM majors) high-skilled workers in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math within the next 4 years. Companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple heavily recruit STEM major students every year. However, the supply of domestic STEM students is far less than the high recruiting demand. Therefore, these companies would be severely impacted if they can't fulfill its headcount by hiring international students in STEM major. On the other hand, these high-skilled talents would flow to countries such as Europe, China and India. U.S. would thus lose its competitive edge to its competitors due to huge loss of talents.

2. STEM major international students do not threat U.S workers' job security. As previously stated, STEM international students are fulfilling the gap between the huge demands for STEM students and the low supply of domestic STEM students. If U.S companies couldn't hire enough workers, they would have to outsource the work to other countries, which helps boom the economy and contributes tax revenue to other countries instead of U.S.

Based on the above points, I strongly recommend to allow international students with STEM major to have an extension of 24 months practical training.
