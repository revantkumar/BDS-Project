I strongly AGREE with the new OPT rule.

For one thing, this will make more nonimmigrant students contribute to the US. They received education here, and should contribute more to her. Thus, rather than forcing them to go home, we should attract more of them to stay here.

For another, extending OPT will not affect the working opportunity of the native students. For sure, this will not affect the working opportunity of the non-STEM students. What I want to say is that, the technical companies (especially those smaller in scale) are not hiring many nonimmigrant students, since the cost of H1B sponsorship is nontrivial. 

Also, what I hope to mention is that, the field of technology is competitive. The whole world is connected, and such protective action is of little use in the process of globalization. What we should do is to embrace the reality, urge ourselves to fight for what we want, rather than just blaming on the change and speaking ill of our opponents while hoping that other would somehow show mercy on us or that our opponents would be weakened.
