I think this proposal can make the high education in US more competitive in the global. Having 12+24 month to do OPT makes the investment for college education more worthwhile for international students. More students major in STEM would consider study in US if this proposal works, and the quality for international students in US universities would be even better, thus making it a benign circle. As a Ph.D student, I definitely would like to see that happens.
