I don't know why so many conservatives hate this new proposal, but as my point of view, those international students deserve more than 24-month OPT, and I hope they can have 36-month one. You cannot imagine those student work how hard to get those jobs in STEM fields, and how hard they work to make companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Boeing greatest companies in the world. 
I've heard people talking about that international students are stealing jobs in america, and this is the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard. Thinking about how much tax those international paid to the government, the tax one international student working for company like Microsoft in a year can make a low-income family one year's AFDC! Those people who cannot find a job must have a reason not to. Like you cannot blame international get your dream job by working hard, while you are having parties in party school and playing games all day.
Just look at how many ceo and founders of the hottest startups in silicon valley have foreign last names, most of the greatest ideas and knowledge are made by those immigrants. Is the inclusiveness to those aliens who love america and work hard that makes America the greatest country. Kicking those smart and hard-working people away, and force companies to hire local lazy people? That's not the America I know.
