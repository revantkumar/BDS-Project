This is a rule that should be definitely supported by students, even US citizens.

1. Some folks always highlight that the STEM students are NOT doing jobs related to their degree. I have to say. This is ridiculous since the law of USA doesn't support this kind of behavior. If u try to get an OPT, the only way is get approved by international center of your school and USCIS. It is almost impossible that USCIS will let the guys get a job which is completely unrelated with his degree. The students can't even get a valid OPT, not to mention OPT extension. 

2. The competition is always the best way to make things living. This country, the high tech firms always choose the best guys to finish their projects, their innovating ideas. They pay us because people can contribute, can work, can create something valuable, not because they are from USA. Identity should not the barrier on realizing their tech dreams.
