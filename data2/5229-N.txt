This is just another kick in the teeth directed by Congress and the White House toward the American people. Do you really believe that you all will not be collectively held responsible for the misery and pain suffered by your own people because of this affront to the unemployed of this country and the dignity of these Americans will be damaged so much that they will fall even farther down with disparage and hopelessness.

Prove to the Americans who are watching you all very closely and don't allow this national blight to continue and even increase. Remember too, that for every action, there is a reaction and your misconduct and disdain or your faithful loyalty to the American people will be documented for future review.
