Zhen Xu I strongly support this policy. Let me give a real world example. My husband has been working in a middle-sized company after graduating with a master degree of statistics. He first used OPT to work and later the company further supported his h1b visa. His company is in a great need of people with advanced statistics skills but has never been able to hire enough people with the required skills. Their team has both native Americans and internationals from Canada, Indian, China, etc. From the company's perspective, it is cheaper to hire native Americans because they don't have to pay the fees for lawyers and other applications to support internationals to work in the US. However, there are just not enough qualified candidates because the job requires a relatively advanced knowledge of statistics. The internationals they hired are all smart people that can fulfill the job requirements.

I think this demonstrate that OPT and OPT extension helps high-tech company to hire qualified people to keep America a innovating country. For foreigners that can come to the US, complete school and manage to get a job offer from a high-tech company, they must be elites in their own country, too. Isn't it beneficial to US that they can have smart people from other country to come study and work in the US? Do you know how many nobel prize winners of US are not actually born in the US? About 30 percent! 

Having students working on OPT and OPT extension doesn't necessarily mean making Americans losing jobs. Like I mentioned above, it helps to fill the high demand from the high-tech companies. Whether this causes lowering the salary is something related to government supervision. The policy of E-verify actually support the view that OPT shouldn't affect the salary of a certain job. As a E-verified company, it should treat all candidates equally.
