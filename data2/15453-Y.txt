OPT extension for F-1 holders can be beneficial to both the students and the US national interest. F-1 students who are employed by the US firms are generally smart talents. They can fit into the American culture and deliver long term benefits. Their employers are mainly outstanding international cooperations which have business and interest across the globe. Employing these immigrants definitely means that these firms can understand foreign culture better and their employees may stay in the US to give their contributions or return to their home country afterwards to allow these US firms expand their business, which would eventually enlarge US job market and serve US national interest. Although some feel it as a threat to employment rate of US citizens, I firmly believe that OPT extension will strengthen US global leadership in the long run.
