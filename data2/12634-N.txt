WHY would we expand and improve the training opportunities for F-1 Students when we have so many skilled and capable Americans that are looking for work? We need to stop and lower the F-1 program and plan to increase funding for our own citizens to gain this valuable work experience. Not pass it out to others who will not pay Payroll tax that is so critical to our Social Security funding.
