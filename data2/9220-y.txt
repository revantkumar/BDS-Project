Zheng Han I strongly support the decision of extending OPT for STEM students. 

A few years in school definitely provide access to this advanced knowledge, but is it enough to become an expert? Absolutely no! As every one with any working experience knows, text book knowledge without practice is useless. The longer you work, the deeper understand you will get about what you learned in school. Think about what could 12-month OPT provide a fresh graduate? Some basic knowledge about the organization, about the mechanics of researches, maybe about personalities of co-workers. That's it. Right after the student gets himself on speed, it's time for him to leave the country. 12-month is far from enough for this student to learn a completed series of research methodologies, or to thoroughly understand the mechanics of applying the text-book knowledge, or to gain a whole set of skills. 

Since US already opened doors to foreign students, why not help them to develop a completed set of knowledge and skills? So that when they go back to their own countries, they can start the career directly. They will then bring not only the advanced technologies, but also the culture to their countries. This can help ope.n minds in their own countries, and in return, open doors to US. The whole program will create a seamless path for US and other countries do business together. 

With these benefits, I strongly support to extend OPT for STEM students!
