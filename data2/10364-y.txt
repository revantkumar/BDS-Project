Xin Xu I strongly support this proposal and I have several reasons to explain why I support this. 

1.Extending the OPT of STEM students will attract more foreign students to come to U.S. in the future. Studying abroad will not always be easy for these student and it would be ideal for them to get the time for a good training within their field of study after graduation. This OPT extension will be a good sign and universities in U.S. will attract more and more talented applicant from around the world since they can not only get good education in the U.S. universities and they can get good training from outside of university after graduation. 
2.OPT extension will help relief the loss of talented people in U.S. companies. As it takes time and energy for U.S. companies to train a fresh graduate into an experienced worker and the company certainly dont want to lose these talents due to their visa status. OPT extension gave these workers a chance to stay in the company and contribute for a certain longer period which is beneficial to a companys growth and development. 
3.International students will open their own companies the U.S., which actually creates employment opportunities for local U.S. citizens. These companies pay taxes and provide services to the local community. However, one year of OPT is not enough for a new startup company to mature and grow and an OPT extension will give these young entrepreneurs to gain more experience and make their company to serve the U.S. society a lot better.
