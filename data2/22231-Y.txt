I personally support this proposal. I do think this proposal is a good solution for cuttrent F1 student's career pathway. Since the 17 month extension was questioned somedays ago, which made a really a dangerous singnal for F1 student that we can't make our career and life plans accordingly. This proposal extended OPT time to 24 month, at least we do not need to arrange our stuff in a rush and the supper expensive abroad studying would not be a meaningless experience.
