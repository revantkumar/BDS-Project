Swati Patil I strongly support this proposal because international students not only pay triple the fees what American students pay but also bring in the wealth of knowledge. Most companies need talent which is through immigrants. Passing this rule will not take away the jobs but indeed create more jobs in the industry. Also, if this rule is not passed then US universities will be at big loss and will fail in attracting talent from around the world to perform good, innovative research.
