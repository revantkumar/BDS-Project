This will be really helpful if Business Information System is added in the STEM category list. My son who completed his High school Graduation and Bachelors in Business Information Systems from USA, got his OPT ONLY for 12 months as his degree is not covered under STEM. 
We are going through Green card process. But that option is also ruled out as he is over above 21 years.
So if BIS is included in STEM, he and others like him who are actually studied software programming and working as Software Developer can be benefited by this.
