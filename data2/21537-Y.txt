I strongly support the extension of OPT for STEM students. The United States is a great country, because it is a free country, and it gives opportunities to anyone who has a dream. Most foreign STEM students are hard working and make profits for the United States. Foreign STEM students are not here to compete with US citizens, they are here to help build a better America. The government of the United States should give them more time to learn and work here.
