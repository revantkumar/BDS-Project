To whom it may concern,

I strongly support this proposal of extending OPT of STEM. The intension of this proposal does not prevent locals from getting jobs.
First, Americans has much more advantages than we, foreign students do. Comparing to us, you have (much much more) better language skills and cultural awareness. I believe, as a employer, they would put all this background information in to consideration of hiring any skilled worker. We lose at the starting line because of who we are. However, as the nation's believe, everyone is equal. I, as a foreigner, should have the same right as a person as who, the other can have. 
Second, any talented one should have opportunities to show his/her skills in order to be appreciated. For employers, employees who can create the most benefits of their productivity is their biggest concern. We aren't being paid less or having less rights. If being motivated is a sin, no ideas about why should we suffer.
Finally, in the whole world, countries are getting closer and closer connecting to each other. While some people object to this proposal, it is clear that pushing away many talented students and scholars because of who they are contrary to the trend.
