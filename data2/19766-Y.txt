I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. This increased duration of practical training is extremely important for students to fully utilize the education they received in the USA. By increasing the STEM time to 24 months you give students sufficient time to gain experience in their field of study which is really helpful and gives a good start for a industry or research oriented career.
