When is the government going to put Americans first instead of foreigners?! Big business wants to bring in cheap labor to displace American workers and politicians on both sides of the aisle are capitulating to their demands in return for campaign donations and votes. It's the continued selling out of America. Look at what happened at Disney. They brought in cheap foreign labor and had their American employees train their own replacements. They threatened them by withholding their severance packages if they didn't agree to it. Doesn't Disney make enough money?! Where were the politicians who keep saying that the middle class is getting "hammered, hammered" and that the pay disparity from top to bottom in these corporations keeps getting worse?! Yet they continue to vote in favor of big business to the detriment of Americans! It's disgraceful.

However, we're in an election year and the very politicians that are stabbing us in the back will try the same tired rhetoric about "we need to tax the rich" and the "one percent" of the population who controls the wealth in this country. Yet they go behind closed door and do the bidding of these people.

It's high time we stop importing people, legal and illegal alike, and put Americans to work. Without a flooded job market these companies will have to pay good wages to attract the best talent. That's one way to put a dent in the out of balance pay scale. It's sad that so many politicians say one thing and do another. As we enter the election cycle we're going to hold these people accountable and vote out those that favor foreign labor over American citizens. We're watching.
