Chris Huang Foreign students they study in United States should have the same opportunity/chance to work in United States. The employers hire the employee to work depending on their ability but not their citizenship. Besides, its very obvious that those students who work in U.S. after graduating did bring a lot of benefits and competitiveness to the nation in high technology industry. If the nation does not give the students a chance to stay and keep the work force but push them back where they come, or they might go to other countries that also have high quality education system which will compete with the work flow in the future. Is that what the citizen really want this happening to our children in the future?
We have to consider this issue very carefully. Why do we want to push them out of the country? Because they don't have the citizenship? Because they step into our comfort zone? Because they bring profit to the country? Once the country is not attractive to those high educational work force, could we compete with them if they form another powerful work force against the country in the future?
In short, the country has spent time educating/cultivating those student, we should try to keep the young work force contribute their knowledge and power to the nation at least. Not flush them out for no reason without considering the future of the nation.
