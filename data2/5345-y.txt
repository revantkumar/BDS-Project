Wesley Leung I strongly support the rule because so many companies especially in CA NY and MA get the benefit from the rule.We can find that the most of STEM degrees students are international students from India and China,especially at the Graduate Degree and Doctoral Degree in engineering area.So there are not enough local students for the companies even we cancel the OPT.As the result, companies will suffer a lack of engineers.It is not good for the companies' development.
