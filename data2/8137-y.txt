Daniel Lu I strongly SUPPORT this new rule. Reasons as following:

1. International students are creating great values for this country. Based on the data(http://www.businessinsider.com/see-how-much-tech-giants-like-apple-and-google-make-per-employee-2015-10), one employee can create over 200k, millions value each year. I am in one of company mentioned above, and many of my co-worker were international students and they did great job.

2. Most international students are well educated and from top colleges, and specially for students in STEM they have the skills the country badly needed. And some of ambitious international student like Mike Krieger (http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-cofounder-mike-krieger-had-an-h1b-visa-problem-2015-4) can build their enterprise and create more job opportunities to American.

There is no rule can satisfy everyone, we believe this new rules will do more benefits to our country, enhancing the our competition(in economy, technology, environment, reducing cost, etc) in the world.
