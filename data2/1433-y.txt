Meng Wu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1: As US university has provided such a good education to these international students, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2: The STEM students contribute a lot to the diversity for U.S. which is the foundation of US society. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. STEM students are high educated, their excellence benefits the entire society and also push the society move forward and as the best country in STEM, help US stay competitive.
