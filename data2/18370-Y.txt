I support this STEM extension policy. America is famous for its open and acceptive spirit. And its also this culture that attracts more and more talented people to contribute for society. The STEM policy is a clear welcome sign to foreign students and shows strong support for US's immigrant-friendly attitude. It will provide companies, especially IT and engineering companies, with strong and lower-cost employees, which is beneficial to the economy.
