I will definitely support this rule.This extension is a great chance for F-1 Students towards there career.This will help all the International students a lot because this will not only give them more time to stay but also to get more experience and i think It Is also beneficial for US economy that more and more international students will go to USA .

But if the 36 month extension will be made then It will be just AWESOME...!!!!

AND a quick note - I don't think that the Employers Manager should be filling the form of the candidate for Visa and other Legal Stuff because it is a pain for employers manager and he will just neglect it and many opportunities of international candidate will be gone just like that . So i would like to see some changes over there.
