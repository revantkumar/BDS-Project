Jiaqi Ma I strongly support this expanding training opportunities. Expanding OPT period can give more time for a student to work in his/her field, especially in STEM subject, practical learning and training is very necessary and takes time. And for company in United States, there are a lot of benefit from this policy. Company can have relatively stable F-1 student working for the same position, compared to 1 year OPT. F-1 student plays an important role on young population in United States residency. They are the main productivity in society and will help this country get better. They are participating highest technologies in the world, even human history. They are making their effort to make this world more efficiency, more peaceful, more intelligent. By all means, I really agree to this OPT training policy
