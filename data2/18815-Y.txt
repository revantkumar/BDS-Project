I absolutely support this proposed rule for extending STEM OPT since this is a win-win strategy for both the international students and U.S. Firstly, there are a lot of international people working in tech industry, and their talented skills help the industry thriving and strong. This proposed rule can just bring more talents to this country. And on the other hand, it gives the international students more opportunities to earn more real-word experience. Furthermore, I also saw some negative comments saying the international students make intense competition for jobs in this country. Actually, this is just another huge advantage the international students bring in. It is a fact that international students work very hard in both university and real industry. This competition will push the citizens to keep improving their skills and knowledge. As a result, the real industry will have more talented employees, both U.S. citizens and international students. 

All in all, the advantage of this proposal is obvious, and we should approve it.
