Say No to any increase in work Visas, we need a reduction. Americans need good paying jobs - and our current administration, and congress are turning their back on the people if they try offering the work to foreigners. Foreigners do not even pay Social Security or Medicare. What are you thinking? I appose any increase in job visas for foreigners - it only increases US unemployment. 

I also agree with Numbers USA comment, "The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers."
