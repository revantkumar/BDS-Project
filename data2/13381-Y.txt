High-profile immigrants are not threats to domestic employments. In fact, they are creating local jobs. Whoever would want to sponsor an H1 visa in cash, if there are competent citizens available? It is doubtful if the jobs can be passed into local hands when the current holders are expelled. They are more likely to remain vacant for a while. A direct consequence is the inflation in labor cost driven by this desperate thirst. Humble enterprises will soon appear on the list of casualty. The state will find its economic engine running out of fuel, but that is not the end of the trouble. There shall be a shrinking local consumer market. People living on the payroll of local industry indirectly by offering service to its employees will also have their jobs at risk. This is indeed a paradox. 

As a footnote, let me share a few thoughts about the history of Rome, the model of this country in many aspects. The republic at its peak embraced all sort of talents regardless of their origin. Novi homines like Marius and Cicero reshaped the military and the cultural tradition of that nation. Even in her declining years, the empire survived for several hundred years only in the protection of "barbarian" mercenaries when all youths of Italy gave up in indulgence their ancestors' martial virtues. The question should not be whether foreigners are to be expelled, but rather how to assimilate them to serve this great country with loyalty.
