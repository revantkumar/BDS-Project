There is currently a big push on to promote our children to pursue an education in the STEM field. This is doing our children a disservice. They will work very hard to obtain a degree in the STEM field and upon graduating will have a very difficult time finding a job. Currently, only about 26% of graduates find a job in the STEM field. The jobs that should have gone to those graduates will be going to CHEAP FOREIGN LABOR. This is SHAMEFUL. The H1B program needs to be put on hold immediately! This program is taking away any incentive for Americans to pursue an education in a technical field. This policy is bad for our students and bad for America. It's destroying the middle class and the strength of America. My very bright daughter is currently a college student, majoring in the IT field. I almost feel that I need to tell her to finish the semester and drop out of college. There isn't much point in accruing huge debt for a degree that isn't going to get you the job you want. Walmart here she comes. What a waste of American intelligence. When will our government stop working so diligently against everyday Americans and stop giving out what is basically corporate welfare to the very rich and powerful corporations? How wrong it is to fire experienced IT workers and replace them with CHEAP FOREIGN LABOR, i.e Disney and others. The greed of well connected corporations is destroying our country. The very idea that there aren't enough technical people is this country is an outright lie. This program is being used in an abusive manner and needs to be ended!
