This rule is very important for all the international students as it will induce a sense of financial security to all the students who are paying hefty loans to get high quality education in the USA. These students have put a lot of efforts and dedication to earn a STEM degree and they definitely deserve this sense of security.
The 24 months is surely a reasonable time period for students to work in their field of their interest and get a good international exposure, hands-on practical application, diverse interaction with the industry & experts and also repay their financial loan dues incurred to earn a STEM degree.
I also feel personally that implementing this rule will in no way hamper the US citizen job prospectus. The industry is booming and lot of innovations are brought to this country by talented international students. This in fact will help in create better jobs opportunities and boost entrepreneurship for the betterment of all US workers and the international community.
A big thumbs up for this new proposal from DHS!!!

I wish the rule had a provision for increased quota for the H1B visa. Because currently, the quota is very small compared to the number of students graduating every year from the accredited US universities.

Cheers.
