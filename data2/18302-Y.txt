The proposed OPT extension can create more jobs for Americans. Almost 900,000 international students are studying in American colleges and universities today, among which more than half are in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). In our small town, with more and more international students come for study, more restaurants and shopping center open, and more people get jobs there. If there is no OPT extension for STEM students, less students will come to US and many people will lose their jobs.
