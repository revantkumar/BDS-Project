This upsets me because Obama is continuing to avoid the problems we have right here in the USA! Like why are women being able to have as many children as they want to while on the Welfare system? Why are the men not responsible for the births of all these children they are responsible for? Obama needs to bow out gracefully NOW! Americans are so sick and tired of his "I'm the boss and what I say goes" attitude! He was accidentlly voted in by people. Now all those people have nothing but regrets.
