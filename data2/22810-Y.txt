I am a recent graduate with a Statistics PhD and I now works as a data scientist in the major online retailing business. From my experience I can not see how I have competed with US citizens on the job opportunity. This comes for three reasons. 

(1) Too few US citizens are even willing to study the data science field even though it nowadays offer very promising job opportunities. My graduate school receives too few US domestic applicants each year; and a good portion of the few US students it enrolls each year drops out eventually because they think STEM is "too hard".

(2) When I was in my last year of my PhD I was touched by many head hunters both from US and China; I did not even hunt for a job. I finally got several offers and received one half a year before my graduation. This company even need to counter offer another offer I got from a Chinese company. Apparently the industry nowadays have a huge appetite for students in my field which can not be satisfied by the US citizen labor force. If those companies can find equally competent citizen candidates, they would not spend so much more time and efforts to look for people like me which not only requires high salary but also request them to sponsor working visa.

(3) So far as I learnt, only e-verify companies are eligible to sponsor OPT extension. E-verify companies are required to employ without discrimination based on immigration status or racial background - in other words, domestic students can not be discriminated against in these companies. Therefore, the argument that STEM extension discriminates against domestic students is totally ungrounded.
