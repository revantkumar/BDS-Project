Sarah Bohrer I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program, as this would allow companies to hire foreign workers and recent college graduates rather than hiring American job seekers. If allowed to pass, this program would artificially expand the pool of available workers, resulting in depressed wages, and would in fact give these companies an incentive to hire foreign workers over American workers because of the payroll tax break they would receive for doing so. Please do not support this proposal, which is wrong on so many levels!
