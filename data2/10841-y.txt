Yi Tsui I strongly support the proposal for extending the STEM OPT. Diversity is something that U.S. value so much. It propels competition in many area such as science and technology. To me, the benign competition will help America culling the best elites from most graduates from US universities. A competition is fair only when all the students are placed in the same market. So I think the government should let these foreign students to stay in America and learn knowledge so that one day in the future, they will make contribution to the U.S.
