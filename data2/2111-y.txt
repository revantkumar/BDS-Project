Mengdi Chen I don't understand why some people are bullshitting against this good policy without a reason. Like it was claimed in another comment, it is shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens.
STEM extension allows the best young people from all over the world who work on the important fields to stay and work in US. If we send them home, those big companies (Google, SpaceX, GM etc) will be forced to relocate their R&D centers in other countries like China, India or Germany, which over time let those countries speed up more and more on developing their technologies. Imagine one day US government begging China for their latest technology.
