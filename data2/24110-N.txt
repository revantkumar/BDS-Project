This whole underhanded and very costly spending on the welfare and benefits of illegal aliens is more than troubling. 
At a time when SSA is under attack and No COLA to help our elder citizens, The president wants to keep adding to the ever
growing purse Scofflaw, criminal trespassers. Can it be legal to siphon off taxpayers funds to aid and abet criminals. Can any
man ; without even aid of a referendum give across the board amnesty to millions of unknown foreign intruders. Too many 
clandestine plans that rearrange treason to become brotherhood. We all know this is rotten but what is our jolly ,holier than thou 
Congress doing about it.
