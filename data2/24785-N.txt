I oppose expansion of the OPT program. A majority of American citizen STEM graduates are not working in their field because companies hire lower wage foreigners. Many companies are terminating American workers to hire lower wage foreigners, as Disney is doing. We need to reduce foreign workers in this country so that Americans can go to work in the STEM field and all others.
