I am an American citizen born in the USA I'm a senior and I need a job! I am a law biding citizen, paid my taxes and I need a job, to put food on my table! there are millions like me that need jobs before we allow any foreigners come in here and take the jobs from us. Unskilled jobs in America usually go to the kids or seniors like me who don't qualify for public assistance but can't afford to put food on the table!
