It did shock me when I heard that someone proposed against the opt extension with regard to foreign students. 

The United States has been a country that embraces difference and celebrate it all the time. It would so unfair to bring up such racist proposal. It is already very hard for F1 students to find a job within a short time. 

Just imagine if such kind of racist proposal is approved, Google then might don't have CEO like Sundai Pichai. This is just a piece of the iceberg. What kind of loss would all this IT company suffer if they can take no more any help from Chinese brilliant people or Indian people. Just imagine what would happen if no more opt extension is allowed.
