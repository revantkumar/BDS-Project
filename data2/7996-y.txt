Nick Giotta OPT is a job killer for the American citizen. It is disgusting abuse of power by another federal agency to write new laws that 
is used by Obama, remember the IRS, Justice Department, EPA, ATF and more. 

This is a new law that is being supported by Obama will deny it. Secrete meeting with the Microsoft company and DHS 
Secretary Chertoff at a dinner party to come up with a new law to extend foreign students stay in America to work for almost
3 years and keep our newly graduated American citizens depended on the government for support.

Why ? Maybe to have the foreign students apply for citizenship and become a Demarcate supporter in the future because they 
believe they were helped by them to get jobs when in fact it was the socialist who helped them at the expense of our own citizens. 
This is part of the socialist to change our country from a republic to a socialist country. By the way socialist are very nave about
this utopia as were the Union of Soviet Socialist Union supporters.
