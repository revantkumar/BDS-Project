I oppose the rule that would expand the OPT program. Immigration policies should protect the American worker instead of 
hurting them. This rule would allow companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years while avoiding their share of payroll
taxes as well as costing Social Security large amounts of money. It is past time we stop protecting immigrants over American 
students as well as increasing the wealth of big business.
