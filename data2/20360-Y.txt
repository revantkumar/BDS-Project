Our international students attend school here, become friends with local students, when we explain to them that we have to go back to our own countries because even though we have a job, we no longer have the visa. They just could not believe it. Neither do our colleagues. It does not sound fair to them. We definitely appreciate the same education opportunities and a one year OPT period, but we could also use a OPT extension to gain more and contribute more here.
