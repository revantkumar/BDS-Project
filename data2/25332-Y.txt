I strongly support the rule proposed by ICEB, that emphasizes on expanding OPT learning opportunities. Not only does this rule expand the horizon of learning outside academia, but it also gives students ample time (24 months) to utilize this period. Availability of such a robust program will encourage students who are currently employed in their OPT period and new graduate students to gain hands on training in a field that is related to what they learnt at school.

It is imperative to know that many STEM graduates are part of very important projects in their organizations and are very valuable assets. 

Enhancing opportunities during the OPT period invites room for more innovation and fresh minds at work. Employing STEM graduate students from US universities helps employers establish university contact for further recruitment. The income that US Universities generate from International students is almost twice of what they would generate from US citizens/ in state students. Curbing the STEM program will not only prove to be a loss to US universities, but to the students who aspire to study in this country and extend their career here.

In order to have a holistic experience, it would be ideal for the STEM OPT period to be expanded to 24 months as opposed to 17months. This is a good time period for students who are already employed, to achieve their goals and gain meaningful hands on learning experience & for students who are about to start their careers, to plan and execute their goals. It is no doubt that STEM graduates are highly specialized and have immense technical expertise. This has to be put to good use by US tech sector companies.

If this rule is executed in time, students will greatly benefit from it. Given the current H1B visa scenario, students will have an ample filing window. I, as a STEM graduate student, kindly request the DHS to implement this rule by December 2015.

Thank you
