Karen Du Expanding OPT opportunities is good for US economy and US tech companies. STEM students are highly skilled and smart, and they introduce healthy competition into the labor market of tech industry. Competition is at the heart of the US economy. Competition lets companies hire the best workers at a price that both parties agree on. Kicking STEM students out of the country just because they have competitiveness in the labor market is like getting rid of the icing on the cake. 

Competition also give US tech workers incentive to improve their own skills. The human productivity of the labor force as a whole would increase over time from healthy competition. 

If STEM students are kicked out of the country, instead of hiring sub-standard workers in the US ( who supposedly got competed out of jobs by STEM students), tech companies can simply move their operations abroad where workers are abundant and pay is even cheaper.
