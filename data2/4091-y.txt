Yi Wu International students from STEM are elites in technology field, who could make great contributions to American development. If the STAM Extension is cancelled, American companies would not be able to hire so many talented professionals to make more profits. 
Immigration problem is not strongly related with STEM Extension. Immigration issue has more strict rules and more limited opportunities, so hiring more STEM professions does not means more immigration. Also, international students' employment has no conflict with American employment. These students service in several specific areas where America does not have enough talents to support the advancement. American are still able to find those jobs they want. Thus, STEM Extension could bring marvelous benefits to America without causing immigration and employment issues. STEM Extension is a great measure and should not be stopped.
