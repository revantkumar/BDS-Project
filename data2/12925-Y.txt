Could people do their homework first before they say anything like this? Do you think Facebook hire foreign software engineers because they are cheaper? This is not a tiny cheasy Chinese restaurant we are talking about. And do you have any idea how much other efforts those tech companies have to put in place to keep those foreigners? From legal, compliance, accounting and finance. Foreign workers are definitely much more EXPENSIVE! Then why do tech companies still want to hire them if they can find skilled americans? They cannot. When I was little whenever I fail at something, my parents always told me to look for reasons with myself and make myself better, instead of coming up with bogus excuses and blame it on the others.
