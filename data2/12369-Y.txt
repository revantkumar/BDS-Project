I strongly recommend the new proposed 24 months STEM extension rule as this would benefit both international students/candidates as well as US Industry cum Economy.An international candidate gets only one chance to file H1b petition in 12 months of OPT EAD period.In most cases due to high volume of H1b petitions chances of an application getting picked in lottery system are less. New proposed STEM extension rule would give maximum of 3 chances if one has to avail. Therefore, I request you to make this proposed STEM rule official.
