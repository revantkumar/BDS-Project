I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..
2. Competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing.the U.S.should not fear any competition.
3. America already is the most strongest country in the word.and It will always be.one of the most importent reasons is the U.S. has diversity and inclusive.
