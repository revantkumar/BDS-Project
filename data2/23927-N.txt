I am weary of Presidents from both Parties circumventing Congress in favor of foreign students and high tech businesses. Consequently, I oppose the proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program. Foreign students can avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Our employment situation in this country is dire and favoring foreign citizens over US citizens is unacceptable.
