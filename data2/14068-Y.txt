I think OPT extension for STEM majors is good for American economic. The foreign students will contribute a lot for both the technology in high tech companies and tax for the government income. Besides, most of these students are awarded assistantships which in another word is US government invest on the development of these students, and so keeping them in the states and get the investment back is much better than paying their tuitions and then let them leave the states.
