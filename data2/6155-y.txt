Zhiwen Wang As an international student in US, I strongly support this rule. It is the openness to talented people that makes America a dream place and a pioneer country. The opportunity for STME students to use their knowledge to service this country benefits US a lot. I would say it is the best way to build up this country. And competitive environment is a great positive input for American citizens.
