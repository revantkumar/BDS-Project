This is INSANITY! How do we expect to get our economy growing unless we have jobs for our American citizens...millions of whom are OUT of work right now? Allowing student visa holders to stay at the expense of AMERICAN students is just plain WRONG. We are way past due for making AMERICANS come first!!
