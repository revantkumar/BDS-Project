Please do not expand the OPT program. This gives non-citizens an unfair advantage over citizens in the job market. We have already provided foreign students with the opportunity to go to college in the US. Their own countries should accept responsibility for additional on job training. We do not pay taxes to give businesses money to hire non-Americans. This would be extremely unfair to our own children. This government is supposed to work for the good of our citizens, not foreigners here temporarily. Americans are not to be treated like second class citizens by our own government
