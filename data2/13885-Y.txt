I support the proposal and think it is both meaningful and necessary.

For the most important reason, America needs them! International students who are qualified and get hired are usually smart, diligent and bring the country new thought, new energy and diversity, America is a diverse country. It's history of success has a root in the history of immigration. The market has big potential and needs people invest their energy, thought and time. International students work hard because they have to in order to survive and stay. America needs such spirit. International students share cross cultural perspectives and usually bring in new thoughts. America needs that kind of people because globalization makes everything international. People who have multi culture background are valuable to American companies. International students are independent, smart, adventurous and a lot them have very interesting stories and experience that most Americans don't have. Those personalities and characteristics are part of American spirit: independent, brave, open and always strive for the better. Giving them more time to stay in the U.S. after they graduated is giving them a better chance to show their ability to contribute. Investing in talented people and give them time is beneficial in the long run.

As for the concern of international students taking jobs, I mean they are also creating new jobs and new chances. Most of them work in STEM, where needs is much greater than supply. Especially in tech fields and finance field, if companies couldn't hire enough qualified people, that would slow down their competitiveness.
