Xiangxue Lv I am in FAVOUR of it, because there are plenty of IT jobs available, but there are insufficient applicants. I mean, IT companies are always wants more engineers, but the num of qualified workers is not enough to meet their demand.

If STEM will threaten the native workers, they would apply these jobs because there are so many jobs waiting for application. But the fact is, qualified engineers are fewer than jobs.

If we pass the STEM, it will let our US's IT companies more powerful, and create more job opportunities for US citizens, like Uber and Lyft, which create many job opportunities.

In conclusion, I am strongly FAVOUR this bill.
