American Citizens who are experienced STEM workers are unable to find work.
American Citizens who are graduates with STEM degrees are unable to find work.
So why is our government doing everything in its power to flood the American labor market with foreign scab?

This proposed rule is just one more instance of the federal bureaucracy under the direction of one-world politicians supplanting American workers by actively encouraging the hiring of non-American.

When does it stop? It seems like it will continue until every American is unemployed!
As a STEM professional who has worked with these foreigners for 20 years I can assure you they bring no special skills or abilities to the workforce. Many of them have such atrocious English and communication skills that they actually cause more problems in the workplace!

MY BOTTOM LINE; If these foreigners are the "best and brightest" the world has to offer, America has no worries about foreign competition!
