I hardily disagree with the expansion of the OPT program. Here we go again shoveling jobs out of reach for American workers and providing a "leg up" for foreigners. The greed of employers looking for a way to pay cheaper salaries to these foreign workers disregards the need for our American workers to find jobs. I'm totally against the increased expansion of 
OPT. America first and then consideration can be given to foreign workers if they are still needed. Employers do not need a program that allows them to set wages and instrumentally cheats Social Security out of much needed funding.
