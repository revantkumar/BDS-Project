This is a PhD student at Arizona State University. My major is electrical engineering with a focus on power system. I have been studying for my degree for over two years. Based on my experiences and over 100 meetings with my fellow researchers and my advisor, it should be noticed that there is a need of engineers in United States, which clearly means that USA is short for smart engineers to grow its economy. The STEM students including international STEM students are and will continue making contributions that cannot be ignored. This OPT extension will enable those smart STEM people to work in USA for longer time, which would provide benefits for the industry development and economy grow in both a short-term run and a long-term run. I would like to post this comment as a feedback I this expansion policy. Again, approve of this expansion will be a win-win Pareto improvement.
