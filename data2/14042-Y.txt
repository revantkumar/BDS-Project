I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I was an international computer science master student from China and was a software engineer intern at Amazon and I work for Amazon right now as a full time employee. After I finished my undergraduate degree in China, I was thinking of getting a master degree abroad, there're few options in my mind, and the most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents who want to have some industry experience which is very important for STEM students because their majors require them to be strongly connected to the current indursty. Without this OPT extension rule, I don't think that US can still attract those STEM students to contribute their knowledge to this country. 
As a software engineer who currently working at Amazon, I think the cancelation of OPT would be a huge disaster from tech companies like Amazon, Facebook or Google. I believe the reason why a lot of my foreign co-workers, including me, could have the opportiny to work for Amazon, contribute to this company and to this country is because of the OPT extension rule. If OPT extension is cancelled, tech companies would lost a huge number of potential excellent employees.

Hope this rule could pass so not only those talented STEM students but also, more importantly, US tech companies could benefit a lot from it.
