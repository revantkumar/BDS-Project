Suzanne Winkler Stop this insanity! I applaud anyone bettering themselves through education, however, once achieved that person needs to return to their home for employment. If there would not be employment in any particular field of study in their homeland, then the opportunity to study it here in the United States of America needs to be either very strictly monitored or dis - allowed. Students should not be given the privilege of entering our great country, to then take a job/career away from an American citizen at a lower wage.
