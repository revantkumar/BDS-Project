This new rules is very reasonable and solid. There are tons of technology company in US which hire international student. This act will give STEM student a great chance to make a contribution to the society. The longer we can stay, the more effort they can make. If we cancel this policy, it will cause a great panic to STEM students. There will be few students in there important field, since every field are the same, why bother choose a harder major? These STEM student learns harder and work harder, they should deserve more than other major students.
