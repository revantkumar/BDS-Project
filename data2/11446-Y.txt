I strongly support this bill. 

The number one reason is that I myself would be a direct beneficiary of it as my OPT would expire soon. There're a lot of H1-B applications didn't get picked in the lottery early this year, either was mine. This extension would be the final hope for people like me to participate in the next lottery. We are fully aware that the chances of being picked in the next one is still low, but we would fight for every chance possible.

Number two, this is an extension of OPT, not an increase in the H1-B cap. Many opposing this bill argue that international STEM students are taking jobs away from US citizens, however they are confused about H1-B visa (formal working visa) holders and OPT students. STEM OPT students are only temporary workers for 17 months. As long as H1-B cap isn't increased, most of OPT students have to go after 17 months. They are not taking away jobs. Instead, they are very disadvantaged when looking for a job. Whether to increase H1-B cap is a separate issue, and out of scope of this bill. As far as the OPT extension is concerned. I don't see the opposing point valid.
