As a PhD student do research in the area of Operating System, I have seen many brilliant researchers in our areas. These brilliant researchers, mainly from CMU/UC Berkerley/MIT/Standford/Pricenton/UCSD etc, have made great contributions not only to the research area of operating system, but also to the development of IT industry. 

However, some of these researchers are foreigners that you guys hated. Let me give you a short list of them:

Ion Stoica (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/), full professor of UC Berkerley, inventor of Chord System, which is the greatest contribution to modern peer-to-peer system.
