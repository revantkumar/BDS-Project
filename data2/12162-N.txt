Good Morning,

I know you all don't care about America anymore, as she now seems to be expendable, but if you did there are so many Americans in poverty, I believe you should focus your attentions to educating and mentoring Americas children so they may achieve the goals you are giving foreign students. Give them the hope of a better life and allow them to do the jobs that Americans will do if given the opportunity.

John Miano, attorney representing tech workers:

the proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination."
"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit."

in Addition: OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

I am against the OPT program. Please reconsider this program and those like it and give American jobs back to Americans.

Thank you,
Debra Barrett
