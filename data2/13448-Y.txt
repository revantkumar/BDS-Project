I support expanding the OPT program for students with a STEM degree. America invested in these brilliant young people and America should let them use their expertise to help American businesses. And these young people also need great opportunities to practice what they learnt. Since America is the most fast developed country in the world, it provide all kinds of possibility and welcome everyone wants to pay efforts. There's no reason not to expand the opt program.
