I would say I support the proposal. Are those native confident about their knowledge background and ability about computer and math? Why are you native people afraid of competition? If you are not smart enough, you would not be qualified to those high-level science or technology-related job positions, no matter if you are native or not. If you are not good, then do not complain about international students. Go and get some books to read. At least try to improve your math, huh.
