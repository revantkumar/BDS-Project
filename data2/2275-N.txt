Our African American and minority and Caucasian High school kids and college age kids have trouble finding jobs. Why are we hurting our Minority kids with these programs that support foreign workers over our Teens who need jobs to be able to afford college? This Is wrong. This is an example of politicians who care about Corporate Campaign donors over our minority teenagers who are trying to get to college!
