I fully support the regulatory action of OPT extension.

1. COMPANIES ARE IN NEED.
In many of the industries, companies are still in need of high-tech talents. For instance, I work for Research & Development in automotive industry. Many of the qualified recruiters are found to be new international graduates from graduate schools. There are a very high portion of the candidates that we are interested in are still not be able to be employed because of the limitation of Practical training time. A longer OPT duration would allow companies to test and find better candidates who fit the positions.

2.OPT EXTENSION WILL NOT AFFECT US CITIZENS.
Even as the applications of H1B Visa increases dramatically for the recent years, the total # of H1B visa issued every year is still limited to 65,000. The extension of OPT will only gives opportunities to some of the students who want to have practical training related to their study field within maximum 3 years. In a long term, the extension of OPT will not affect the full-time employment opportunities for US citizens. 

3.EMPLOYMENT EQUITY ENABLES DIVERSITY AND MAXIMIZES COMMON INTEREST
The barrier of employment inequity should be removed for designated groups as visible minorities. This should be considered as the same way for F1 students. Not only the passion of new graduates but also their diversified culture and education background could help our society moving forward. We should give freedom for both employers and employees to find their best fit. Otherwise, we would suffer the lost as an entire society from prevention of free employments.
