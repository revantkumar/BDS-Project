It is a very welcome move by DHS to reinstate the STEM OPT extension rule and further revise it for 24 months. This will prove to be very critical in attracting best talent to US and retaining them.

However, I have a very serious comment on the e-verification requirement for this STEM extension. While most companies which hire international students are e-verified, it is not the case with the US Universities.

Most of the universities are exempt from the verification requirement and they do this process only for federal contracts. This severely impacts the chance of students to work as a researcher (after M.S. or a Ph.D.). I am a Ph.D. from US university and working as a post doc researcher at NYU. However, I can not apply for extension as the university is not e-verified. This is really a nightmare for all the Ph.D. holders like me, as they mostly work in universities after graduating.

I would strongly recommend to look into this and if possible, relax the criterion for e-verified employer at-least for the universities.

Thanks
