I definitely support the expanding not just because I am an international students.
Expanding the OPT time is win-win opportunity for both the international students and the U.S. government.

For students from these majors, it would be so great if they could have the chance to get some hands-on experience after graduation and America could provide some resources and platforms for them. They would bring a lot of improvement and value with their degree of masters and PhD by standing on the shoulders of Giants and U.S. is one of the Giants. 

Second, expanding the duration means increasing the competitiveness of local labor and that's not a bad thing. Big progress could be made in the competition.

U.S. is a harmonious mix of different ethnic group and people come here because they want to learn and create.
