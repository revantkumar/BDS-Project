Gwen Sternberg I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
Allowing U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, making it
harder for American students to compete is incomprehensible. How can our government do this to the American workers? 
The federal government has to stop creating incentives for companies to hire foreign people over American citizens. 
Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also
gives them more rights and privileges over the American student and worker? This attack on France should be a wake up call to
the federal government to stop promoting foreign privilege over American born rights. Our own federal government is selling
out American citizens and jeopardizing our safety. It is appalling to know that our federal government has sold out its own U.S.
born citizens for cheap labor. Then you have the nerve to use protesters to go out and try and raise the minimum wage,
when in reality, it is the federal governments regulations and controls that are causing the problem.
