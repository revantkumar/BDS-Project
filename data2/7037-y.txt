Sid A. I strongly support the STEM OPT extension for International Graduate Students educated in accredited American universities. These students have excelled academically in their native countries and then traveled thousands of miles to obtain an education in our country. It is imperative that we ensure their continued contribution to our economy by allowing them to stay in this country after graduating and obtaining advanced STEM degrees. The other factors that need to be considered are that companies in the United States have already recruited thousands of such students resulting in massive financial outlays of millions of dollars. All this money would surely go to waste if these law-abiding, tax-paying and obviously intelligent members of our society are uprooted from their existing professions and tossed out without consideration. Having inconsistent and often-changing laws is not healthy for our economy or citizens. 

I would like to reiterate my support for the 24-month STEM extension for non-immigrant students and improving the cap-gap relief for all eligible students.
