I strongly agree with this plan.The following are my reasons.

1. When I was a undergraduate in the top 3 school in China, many of my classmate decide to further study abroad, such as US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason we choose U.S. is that US provide us the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. Thus opt-extension will attach more talented students to U.S. The development of the high technology in U.S. is indispensable of these talented STEM students' contribution.

2. 12months regular + 24 months extension is a good fit for completing a project. In technology field such as software development, it usually takes 2 or 3years to fully complete one project. If opt-extension time is too short, STEM workers may not be able to work when the project is still in progress.

3. I live close to campus and I found that most of my neighborhood are international students. They rent the house and actually increase the income of local people. My landlord is very happy that she has a house near school and she can make money by renting the rooms to students. She said her life quality is greatly improved by this revenue. The extension will attach more students to U.S. and they could make contribution to the U.S. economy by spending money on renting houses, shopping and travelling, etc.
