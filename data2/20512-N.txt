I oppose expanding employment opportunities for these foreign OPT students who will be competing against my family and neighbors for the same jobs. Their eager prospective employers sill reap tax benefits while denying workers for the foreign nation that claimed shortage of trained workers in order to enroll their students in our American training programs. Our tax payers lose all around.
