I have been working as a Software Engineer with OPT (& extension) for almost two years. From my observations, there are three reason why OPT and OPT extension benefits America technology grows as well as economy grows. 1) Students with OPT most like have very high skill sets which benefits lots of America hi-tech company, such as Google, Microsoft etc. 2) For mid-level IT companies, OPT students benefit them with professional skill sets and with relatively non-compensation salary, comparing to hire American employer with same level skill sets. 3) For students from countries like China who only has 1-year F1 visa, once the visa expires, the salary tax they are paying is AS MUCH AS H1B worker, which is a huge contribution to American Tax grows.
