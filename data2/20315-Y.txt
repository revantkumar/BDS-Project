To whom it may concern:

Expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees is a boost to both U.S academia and Industry. By extending the OPT, the us educational system will bring in more money as well as more skilled works. This will make the country stronger and competitive. U.S has no point to let go those good resources to other countries.

If only making the OPT 1 year, I will a sudden lose of international students' enrollment rate in the higher educational system. This will be a disaster to all the U.S universities and it may reconstruct the whole higher educational system. Also, It will directly influence the IT industry which will be a boom to the economy.

I sincerely, support the Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non immigrant Students with STEM Degrees. This will be a beneficial policy to the U.S economy.
