For the first 26 years of my engineering career (BSEE) I was employed in my chosen field, but for the last 12 years I've been working outside my specialty - software engineering. Why? Simple - employers can (and my last high tech employer did) hire 4 Chinese (or Indian or Taiwanese) engineers for what I was costing the company. Even more important, is that these foreign engineers do not incur pension or medical insurance costs anywhere near what a native does. Use 'em and forget 'em. Nice work, if you can get it. Trouble is for taxpaying US citizens it is a ripoff!
