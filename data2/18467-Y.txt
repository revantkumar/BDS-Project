I strongly support the OPT extension for the following reasons.

1. Diversity is key In the U.S culture. Foreign students significantly promote cultural understanding. Also, F-1 student between the connection for all different country.

2. Learn from U.S and apply learning to U.S .It's good for international students in STEM major working longer for US companies, using their talent to contribute the society and industry

3. If less people working in the STEM area, the U.S. will lose the science and technology leadership to other countries, and will lose innovation, industries, and thus job opportunities to other countries. 

I am strongly support this rule!!!!
