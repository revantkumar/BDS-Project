Ankit Kumar I think it is an amazing opportunity for this country and as well as for international students. As far as the work visa is concerned and that foreign jobs take away american jobs, I have never seen it in the companies I have worked at. The Fortune 500 companies that I worked for never discriminated against anyone and had no intentions of hiring low wage workers. All they need is smart people to help growth of this country, the beautiful country of immigrants who can think freely and be successful. Also, other comments about students going to consultancies, I would say that most of the students that pay top dollars for american education and put in hardwork, they go for good jobs and we can also not neglect some students that might misuse it. It is with every system and is unfair to punish all the hardworking students for some. I think USCIS has taken a great step forward with this rule.
