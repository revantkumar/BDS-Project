Michael Golieb We need to spend our funds helping our own. We have plenty of bright young people who could be trained to do any STEM job. The truth is that those from outside the country are simply willing to work for less. So, by allowing them in, you are hurting ALL. It is worse than increasing overall supply of these skills, but it lowers their value even more than simple supply and demand when those you are bringing in will certainly work for even less.
