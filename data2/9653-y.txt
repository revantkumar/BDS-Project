Ben Powell Is it really in our national interest to drain the best brains from India & Pakistan while idling our own? 
How can we expect students to study science, technology, engineering and math without hope of gainful employment when they graduate? 

Plundering Asian human capital while suppressing our own is not the full extent of the negative effects of this policy. Many if not most of the students coming from Asia are Muslims inculcated with an alian and inimical ideology at war with western civilization. Do we really want Muslims in positions where they can insert back doors and virus code into software that runs our industrial, medical and communications technology?
