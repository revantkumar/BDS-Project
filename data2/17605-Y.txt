I think its definitely the best idea to have stem extension for 36 months. This would have the mutual benefits among the employees, employers and the US economy. Its a well-known fact that there are lots of employees who are dependent on OPT and its extension to work in the USA legally and their contribution to their company and US economy on the whole is equally important as any other employee who is not depending on OPT. And not having the extension at all would have serious impact on everything. Also, increasing the extension from 24 months to 36 months will increase the probability of employee retention and will definitely account for sustained growth in US economy.
So, I definitely support this new rule and hope to see in action.
