No to increasing foreigners. Our own USA citizens need the work. More foreigners do not need to come to our country, as some more likely would be terrorist and attack us right under our nose. President Obama will continue to put us in danger. President Obama does not care about us with the increasing of foreign people from various countries. I truly believe that it will be a huge mistake. Take care if our own.
