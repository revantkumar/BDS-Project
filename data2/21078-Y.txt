I support this new rule since:

1. US heavily depends on tech industry to maximize the economic growth.

2. The local human resources of US are not enough to support the fast development of the tech industry.

3. OPT is a good means to attract talented people around world to work in US and serve the growth of US economy.

4. OPT will not decrease the chance of employment for US citizens, since honestly, companies usually are willing to hire a US citizen than an OPT student.

5. OPT students hired by companies are usually good workers, which means, they will work hard and make a positive influence on the companies and US economy.

6. For the OPT students, their dream is usually quite simple: work hard, gain valuable experience, and live a peaceful life in US even if they finally have to leave here.

7. This new rule can reduce the burden on the OPT students' shoulders, which means, they may put more vitality in their work.

8. This new rule can attract more talented people to US, since it's a good way to say "we are welcoming you".

9. There are a lot of OPT students working in US currently, if these people have to go back next year, there would be a panic on the companies in which they are working for, and the US economy will definitely be damaged.
