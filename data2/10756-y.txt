Yilin Yang I support 24-month STEM opt extension. 

I'm currently working in banking and finance industry. We need pronounced mathematical knowledge as well as very good computer programming skills to modeling on financial products. A robust model is the key factor to develop the strategies on marketing, pricing and reducing loss. The U.S. economy will go downward if these financial products are not modeled and estimated in a correct direction. 2007 Subprime crisis is a typical example. It was caused by the wrong models and credit ratings of these structured financial product, such as CDO, MBS, ect.

80% of my colleagues who do modeling for financial products are internationals. They did a really good job. They not only have great knowledge hands-on experience in modeling, but also most of them have rigorous thought, which is very important in mitigating risks in daily operation. 

In my team, we now have several vacant positions. People with great skills are in demand. In the past, we have great cooperation with our international colleagues. When hiring people, those with excellent skills are competitive candidates.
