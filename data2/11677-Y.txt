I strongly support this proposed rule. It is both good for international students and American people.

The STEM students don't rob Americans of their jobs. The STEM students can only work in tech industry by this proposed rule. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skills and capabilities because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students are more unstable. And the companies has a potential risk to loss the international employees if they can't get their H1B visa in the lottery system. They don't want troubles. But the international employees fit their needs. They have to hire someone who could be competent for their job. That is the only way the STEM students can get that job.

US is the strongest country in this world. No one can doubt the contributions the international workers made in US, especially the high-skilled and knowledge international workers. I don't think that educating them and then forcing them to leave is a good idea for US. If the international students want to contribute their passion and intelligence to US and they can, why not to help them and give them an opportunity?
