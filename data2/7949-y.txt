Tingkai Liu As an international student myself, I cannot stress enough the importance of this amendment. 

For the international students, this amendment will provide us with more time to contribute back to the American society.Rather than being pushed away from the country where people take pride in being one of the most diverse nation in the world, this amendment give us the opportunity to use the knowledge and training that we have obtained through our education to benefit the people who gave us this invaluable learning experience - the American people. It will also give us time to make important life decisions like "what's next?" and "where do I go from here?" 

For the American citizens, our contribution in the society will not come at the expense of your job security. Students who will potentially benefit from this amendment fought their ways through educations at home and excelled just to get to the United State. By keeping this group of hardworking people in the work force for just a bit longer, it will promote the generally efficiency of the total American work force. By incentivizing the local population to work harder, international students can play a significant role in improving the economy which will in turn benefit the local residents. Beside, the financial benefits international students get through working is largely fed back to the local community through our expenses. 

Please, give us some time and let us be part of the joint effort to make local communities better.
