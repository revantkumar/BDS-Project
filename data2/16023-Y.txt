I strongly support this proposal... Extending the STEM opt will not only give opportunity to foreign worker but also boost US economy. If the extension is not approved then the foreign students wont come here to study and the tuition that comes in from outside US will stop. Moreover, foreign students want to make most of the opportunity that they get here which is not possible right now in their home country. So, its better for everyone that this proposal is approved
