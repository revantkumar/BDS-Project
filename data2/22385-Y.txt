Like thousands international students in Silicon Valley and other area of U.S, I am working extremely hard in contribution to the tech development of U.S. We help save this country huge amount of money in training well skilled and talent students before we got jobs, instead we paid incredible high expense of international tuition. I think not only tech industry needs us to move forward, but also the country needs this diversity to keep its pursuit of freedom and american dreams.
