I strongly oppose this proposal. Our citizens deserve better than this. Allowing companies to hire foreign students for a longer period of time at a lower cost is clearly a slap in the face to Americans. There is no benefit to us. Helping people get an education is a positive step but then these students need to return home so that they can contribute to the progress of their own country.
