I believe OPT-extension is NECESSARY for US. As an international student, the reason why I choose US for further education is not only the education quality and resource, but also the opportunity to use the knowledge we learned from school to real industry. And OPT is the core since we would not have enough experience in industry: we have to admit that the project in school and in industry is totally different. Without this training, we will lose more than half of what should be learned.
As for the length of OPT, it is also NECESSARY to have this extension, since most projects are not only 1 year long. We could not quit the project we are working on just because our OPT is expired. 
In addition, OPT is gives us an equal opportunity to contribute to any organization we work for. "E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status." I think we should not reject based on anything that is not his/her ability.
