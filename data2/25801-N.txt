I'm continually amazed at how our elected officials spend so much time trying to expand opportunities for non-citizens. Yes, America is always supportive of the rest of the world. It's time, however, for the people we elect to represent Americans, to step up to the job. We have the bright young people. Let's focus on developing them. Let's stop taking the easy path to hire outside of the American citizen pool.
