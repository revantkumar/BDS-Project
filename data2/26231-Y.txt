As a neighbor and an American friend of three international students, I must stand out and say they represent most of these international students who study so hard in STEM field. They also paid much more than American students do! What eligible international student create is the future and high innovation. They're working to change this world to let us live better!! 
If we let these hardworking and intelligent people out of United States, I definitely believe we'll lose more than we might think! These international students will go to other countries which welcome them and get their devoted work, which will greatly harm US top place in the world.

Also, if we let them leave US as they finish their education, think about what will happen to incoming students? Don't you think education tax is a huge part of US economy? If we prevent their development, later students will choose to study in other countries. we LOSE too much by driving them away! So please, let them stay using their OPT extension and make more contributions to our country!
