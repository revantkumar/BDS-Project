I support this proposal.

As a beneficiary of OPT STEM expansion program I am currently working on a cloud computing company which has more than 1 million active users, with Master degree in Computer Science. I have been contributing to my team to make our company successful also I know many other students like me. They had an advanced degree in STEM and highly paid to work on high tech industries.

The OPT STEM expansion not only gives us more time to contribute to US society, more importantly the innovations which are essential for modern age. Since it's for STEM degrees I don't see the proposal is hurting US native employments.
