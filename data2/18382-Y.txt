From my perspective, I don't think STEM students are taking American citizens' jobs. They are not taking those average jobs or low income jobs but instead they are filling the positions that most of Americans can't do, like cutting edge technology and science field. STEM students studies the majors that most Americans are not willing to study and take the job that most Americans are not willing to do or not qualified. So overall, it does not make sense that STEM students are taking Americans' job opportunities. If you look at the past, foreigner scientists and high technology elites contribute a lot for US's science and technology. It's undeniable that those elites make an impact to US's science which leads to better economy. 
Moreover, nowadays, more and more foreign students come to US for better education. Being able to keep those STEM students will enable them to contribute more to US instead of other countries. The government should let them get the education and later let them stay in the country and make a contribution to US. 
Competition does exist, and we believe competition is one of the reason that push the society forward and advance. Where there is no competition, there will be no improvement and progress. US is famous for it's high paced and competitive market, it does not make sense the country who name itself as the best country is afraid of competition and avoid talented people and elite. Just like a great person is not afraid of competition but embrace it, a developed country US should be afraid of having more elite and talented people stay to stimulate the science and technology advancement. 
Also, a lot of technology companies is composed of a decent percentage of STEM elite. If they couldn't stay, it for sure will be a huge loss for the technology and science field. And I believe it will therefore influence US's economy too.
