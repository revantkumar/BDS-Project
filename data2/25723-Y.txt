As an international student, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Actually, most American were immigrants and it is the immigrants helped U.S achieve what she has today. U.S. should give new immigrants more opportunity to achieve their American dream, but keep them out of from the country. 

3. Competition does exist, but it is the drive force for making U.S. a better country. Without competition, her people would stop working hard to realize their dreams.
