Linda Siemienas I definitely oppose the DHS proposed rule that would expand the OPT program. This expansion would allow the US tech. companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their fair share of payroll taxes equivalent to 7.65% of the employees pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over our qualified American students, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work especially in our current economy, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over our struggling US citizens.
Kindly, rethink this regulation before it is too late!
