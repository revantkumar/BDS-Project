Selina Li I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of expanding OPT.
1. Diversity. It means justice and equality, only with which the country would continue to grow.
2. Talents. The OPT is crucial to collecting the global intelligence.
3. Competition. Competition makes the market better, namely, it encourages people to be better.
