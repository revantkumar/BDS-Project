Vivek Vyas I did my Bachelor's from New York then worked for 27 Months on OPT. Currently doing my Master's and will again be working for one more year. That means I spent 8 years of my life working hard in USA but still without any status guarantee. This makes so hard to decide any future plans. The education and the experience I and other friends have gathered is good but need support so that we can focus more on our work and less about the status issues.
