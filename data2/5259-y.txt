Vinay K I strongly SUPPORT the new rule to extend the OPT period for F1 students studying in the US. This rule is a win-win for
everybody in the long run. This will not only help students get a better practical industry exposure. it will also provide them better chance to apply for H1B. These students in turn make a substantial contribution to the growth and development of companies they work of for, especially in the IT sector. These companies contribute to the economy in a big way. The presence of well qualified work force also creates an environment where startups bloom and flourish.These in turn create more employment opportunities. The misconception that F1 students rob local citizens of their jobs is illogical. The new rule, with its extended training opportunity also encourages foreign students to choose universities in US for higher studies bringing in a lot of money in the form of tuition fee and expenditure.
