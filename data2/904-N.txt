Why is DHS setting regulations and rules for education in America? Education should be under every state's ability to educate their citizenry! DHS is supposed to be in charge of security of America's borders?! What's up with that? Besides, why is DHS giving jobs away to non-legal immigrants? AMERICANS should be given FIRST PRIORITY when those jobs become available!!
