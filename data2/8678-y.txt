Jiang Zhu I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposal. This proposal will surely benefit the F-1 students as well as American people:

1. OPT extension will enhance the overall value of U.S higher education and thus attract more foreign student. Stimulate local economy and create more job opportunities. 

2. U.S and global high-tech companies would employ talented employee with less cost. More high-tech companies would prefer to operate within U.S and thus bring more job opportunities back to U.S and strengthen the economy. 

3. Middle and small business holders would have a chance to hire highly educated top level graduates. Broaden their horizons and have a more promising future.

4. Government tax income would benefit from increasing number of STEM employees. 

5. The F-1 STEM student would help restoring U.S influence when they eventually finish their OPTs and return to their home countries. 

The OPT extension would serve as an important facilitator and catalysis to the U.S economic and will provide more salary and job opportunities to both the American people and F-1 students.
