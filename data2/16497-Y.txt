This law case should be definitely passed, because it benefits a lot for the development of US. Science and technology is US's core. Without high-technology, US's army, politics, economy and education will be totally lost. You can imagine that no one want to live in US if that situation happens. In order to make our country better, we need more and more international students and employees to come, so that US can keep those most talented people with higher education. By the way, these higher education international students will not make any effect to the Americans' job hunting. Americans always have the priority to be hired in the job marketing. The international employees can only be hired if no Americans would like or can do. As a result, I strongly support this law, since we will get the double-win. Why not.
