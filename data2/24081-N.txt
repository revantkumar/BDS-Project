The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.
We have witnessed numerous companies violate the H1B rules placing thousands of Americans out of work.
In addition to this, the introduction of the common core curriculum is placing foreign students at an unfair advantage over Americans as it has utterly destroyed creative thinking.
It has become quite clear that the fundamental change that Obama promised is destroying this country.
