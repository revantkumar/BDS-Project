Jennifer Carr International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.
