I am against the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program. This rule is once again a way for the government to further the interests of big companies and foreign workers, over American workers. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. Like most Americans, I am tired of being pushed aside, and being made to support new foreigners coming here with my taxes and programs that benefit them over our own adult children who need those jobs. This artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. Make no mistake about it, we see what the government under President Obama is doing and we do not like it or approve of it!
