I support this Rule for the following reasons:
1. Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) related industries are great contributors (around 55%) to the US GDP (data from Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2014). Don't need to say that the STEM talent resources help our nation to maintain her world leading position. Not only do the industries that are related with STEM, but also maintaining the US leading position in the world requires a lot of hard working employees and researchers in this fields. Highly educated STEM international students are great resources while few citizens are willing to do those hard, tedious works with medium wages. Extending F1 student OPT will provide more human resources and benefit these major industries.

2. Great amounts of funds for science and technology research are spent every year. And a lot of international students contribute to relieve the financial pressure of it (considering the overwhelming amount of international students in STEM programs). If OPT is only one year (maybe a lot of highly-educated students even don't want to work for our industry after they see the unwelcoming policy, or they even will never come and this will hurt our STEM academic performance), it will be a big blow for our education and economy.

3. Those STEM students receive high education in the US. They are LEGAL TAX PAYERS and very self-disciplined. They contribute to our economy as much as US citizens. And their present is the potential consumers!
