Prior experience tells me this comment is nothing more than cathartic since overwhelming citizen concern at extending work visas to H-1B spouses went unnoticed.

While I support the underlying concept of an OPT visa to provide an opportunity to coalesce the knowledge garnered in a collegiate program, the STEM extension can be construed in no other way than a labor ploy for companies. Three years is clearly to fill a desire for labor.

While it attempts to provide assurances that this will not be at the expense of citizens, the utterly impotent policies in the H-1B and Green Card programs give me absolutely no reason to believe these measures will be any more effective.

If you believe this proposal is effective in protecting citizens' job prospects, you are too ignorant to the effects of skilled immigration and economics to be involved in this discussion.
