Dan Smith Improving OPT extension and relieving CapGap for eligible students is a good proposed rule. Many people might concern this improvement will threaten the job opportunities for the US citizens. However, that's not true. There's no motivation for a US company to hire people with OPT/F-1/nonimmigrant visa instead of a US citizen. An E-verify company should prevent discrimination, it can be announced by USCIS E-verify rule "it is important for employers to develop, implement and enforce anti-discrimination policies, practices and procedures, and to ensure that all employees conducting Form I-9 verification or E-Verify confirmation understand all program rules. " Moreover, to hire an non-citizen employee, there're more costs, including E-verify fee, OPT-extension fee, H1-b application fee, relocation fee, etc. 

In conclusion, this rule will not threaten the job opportunities for the US citizens, but on the opposite, it can help the US economy growth.
