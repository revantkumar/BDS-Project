Far too many American IT workers are unemployed and they should have the first opportunity to be hired before foreign non-citizens are hired. In fact some US companies, such as Disney have laid off American citizens from their work force and replaced them with workers from India and other foreign nations. Indeed many of those US citizens who were laid off, were required to train their own replacements, at the desks where they had been working. Failure to do so, and speaking out about it, meant loss of severance pay! There is nothing wrong with employing our own citizens first!
