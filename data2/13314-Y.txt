This proposed rule is great and it will benefit everyone, as international STEM students at training/work bring significant benefits to the whole American society.

They solve the urgent problem US is now facing: shortage of STEM graduates, which brings to employers fresh blood and higher profits, and to fellow employees smart and able colleagues as they are.

Compared to illegal low-skill immigrants who threaten the job positions of many Americans each year, highly skillful international STEM students at training/work not only are harmless to the aforementioned job positions but also creates thousands or even millions more job positions by consumption and boosting the economy on a higher magnitude.

Expanding the opportunity for these lovable students will do us more good and no harm at all.
