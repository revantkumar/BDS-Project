I completely agree and support this proposal. This step taken by DHS will benefit the US economy to a great extent.

On an average a student spends $30,000 towards his masters degree, and it makes no sense to train these highly qualified people and then letting them go without any contribution to our economy. 

Implementing this rule is not going to change that H1-visa limit, but give enough time for students on OPT to have ample time to go through relevant experience and for the industry to get value in that time frame. 

I would recommend that the proposed rule also allow the people in the 60 day grace period following the current STEM OPT should also qualify for the remaining 7 months.

If we do not use this resource in the interests of our nation, someone else will. 

God Bless America !!
