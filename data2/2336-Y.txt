I am running a small restautrant near an university. Recent years, more forgein students became my customers and my bussiness has been much better than it was. Many small business owners in our town are also benefitted from these forgein students. I believe that by allowing them to work and stay here longer, small business owner like us can get more benefits. So personally, I support this proposal.
