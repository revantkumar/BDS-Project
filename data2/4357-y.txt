Tao Chin I strongly support this rule!!!

Except Indian who are the original citizen of U.S? Don't forget your ancestors!

Everyone has the right to have a American Dream!

You said that international students will lead citizens lose their job? That's not true!

The jobs which fill as international student are not U.S citizen, because they cannot find citizen to do it and then they instead international student of it!
