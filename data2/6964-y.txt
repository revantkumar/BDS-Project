Yufei Yan Six years ago, I came here to study as a J-1 student majoring computer science, which meant that I had to go back to county after graduation and stayed at least 1 year. At that time, I never thought that I would go back to US. I grasp skills, and I will construct my own country, make it as strong as US. 
Now I came back for Ph.D degree with 3-year work experience as an F-1 student. Why? I realized that academic here is pure. I understand that the extension for training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees would threaten the availability of job positions for US citizens. However, do you ever think why highly skilled STEM students can beat over most of US citizens? That is because most top US students don't major in STEM. Companies have no choice but to hire non-residential students who have related majors. Even without this rule, these job positions won't be shared with most of you who have complained. Do you ever think that STEM students would create more job positions for US citizens? Let's make it simple. STEM students work for companies, make companies stronger in US. Meanwhile, companies get larger, and will hire more people. Finally, more STEM students, more job opportunities. 
Think about it.
