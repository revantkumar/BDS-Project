1. For international STEM degree students, the OPT extension definitely is the important factor deciding how long they gonna stay at United States after they graduate. 
2. US was created and build by immigrants and even now still continue to attract more talent people from other countries, so this proposal releases more determination and good signals.
3. International students have more difficulties than US citizens when finding a job. Those outstanding international employees who found a job undoubtedly gain more competition to America's local companies and communities, while the OPT extension prevents these organizations from losing those people.
4. If OPT extension is canceled in Feb 2016, up to millions of foreigners have to leave America, meaning that a huge employee shortage will happen and this shortage will never be filled by any other people. Also if this thing comes true, a bad example will be opening in the history.

I am one of the international STEM degree students and hope this proposal could be adopted, because this is not about my future and also the future of United States.
