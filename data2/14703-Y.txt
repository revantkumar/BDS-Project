Here are some points why I support extending the OPT period for F-1 student with STEM Degrees

1. Thousands of talent international STEM students are working in various companies in different areas across the country. They develop their career here and at the same time contribute to the countrys economy. If this proposal didnt pass, they would have to leave the country by February next year, which is a sudden loss to many U.S. companies, as well as to U.S. economy. 
2. If this proposal didnt pass, potential international students will have less opportunities to stay in U.S. after they complete their degree. For those students who plan to develop their career in U.S., this would be discouraging and they may not consider coming to U.S. at the very beginning. U.S. may lose a lot of talent scholars and engineers because of this.
3. International students are only a small portion of the entire students population. International students shouldnt be a threat to local students for job finding. On the other hand, jobs market should be a free market as well. Both international students and local students should be treated equally when looking for a job.
