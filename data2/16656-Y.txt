I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1.It's necessary to learn some practical skills in the work after graduating from school. If we can get experience and learn useful practical skills in the industry with state of art technology, we are more qualified to get a good job when we come back our own country. That's why people would like to choose America rather than other countries to pursue their degrees.

2.Many American hi-tech companies cannot find enough qualified local people working for them, so they have to hire foreigners. If this proposal is not approved, these companies may loss large number of outstanding staffs who are always contributing to American society and making this country ever better.
