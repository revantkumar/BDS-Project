Please do not expand the availability of Optional Practical Training (OPT) for foreign students. This proposal is based on a false perception that there is a shortage of workers educated or trained science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. With over 90 million Americans currently out of work, or seriously under-employed, many with advanced STEM degrees, no foreign worker should be hired for an American job until ALL qualified American applicants are gainfully employed.

Speaking as a displaced technology worker, this is insanity that our own government would promote foreigners over citizens... We no longer have a government by and for the people and these types of actions will ultimately drive our citizens to revolt, with serious consequences to elected officials.

It has gotten to the point that U.S. citizen qualified workers are only hired if an OPT worker cannot be found, which is the exact opposite of what should be happening. Has this country's government gone insane?
