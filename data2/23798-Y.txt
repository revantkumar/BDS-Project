I strongly SUPPORT opt extension. Only talented international students can be hired by U.S company. Skilled staffs can benefit more to American industry and economy than cheap ones, no matter now they are U.S. citizens or foreigners. Many successful American engineers, mangers, entrepreneurs began their career as a foreigners in America. According to history, many of these outstanding international students turned to be U.S. citizens after nonimmigrant visa status, and contributed much more to U.S. as a tax payer. So, it's more beneficial for America to hold these hardworking international students than to donate these smart guys to other countries, other competitors.
