I strongly support expanding training opportunities for no immigrant F-1 Students with STEM Degrees for following reasons:
1. STEM students can satisfy demand of modern corporate development.
2. More students can have jobs in U.S. Can increase local economi demand
3. STEM students contribute to lots of startups
