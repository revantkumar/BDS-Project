This is a very much welcome regulation. This rule would enable highly trained STEM individuals (including PhDs) to stay here.

The paucity of H1B visas has been forcing many of these individuals to return to their countries. Many of these are researchers and engineers from top universities in US, trained by the best Professors in the latest technologies, paid for by the US taxpayer. I am sure economies like India and China will lap up the individuals and the technology know-how. This legislation would be a welcome change to reduce uncertainty for many of these folks and more importantly enable US to maintain it's technological lead.
