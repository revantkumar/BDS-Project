Aditya Shringarpure I strongly support the US Government decision to provide STEM extension to F1 students. Foreign students are a majority in most of the Graduate schools and help the US economy via their tuiton fees. There is a huge difference between a person who is working in the US via an Indian company, and a person who has invested his own money to get a US degree. Hope the government can consider allowing F1 students to stay for a longer time, and draw a clear differentiation between foreign students and foreign workers.
