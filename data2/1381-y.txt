Pei Zhang To whom it might concern:

I am writing this comment to support the 24-month-OPT extension.

The following is one of the 

US would benefit a lot by having top and talented students from all over the world to come to the states. With the amazing development of circuit integration and soft engineering, people in the 21st century are able to free our mind and have tons of great ideas that can make our lives. For example, in order to make public transportation more easier, Travis Kalanick and his coworkers invented Uber. Oculus Rift was invented to make a 360 visual videos and games due to the need of unlimited human imagination. Andrew NG, co-founders of Coursera, one of the great public online education website, makes it free for everyone to have advanced education that only those who got accepted by Stanford, MIT and so or can have. Studying in this country, we witnessed all these great things happening. This Nation already gathered plenty of gifted people together from all over the world. With all the diversity and free mind, I believe the country will come up with more and more great ideas that can change the world. However, as a matter of fact, we will have a great chance to be in lack of talented and specialized people who can make all those ideas happen. This is becasue the power of human imagination always exceeds our learning ability. By extending OPT to 24 months top students from all over the world can stay in the states for more time. As a result, they would have a better chance to dedicate themselves and make the country better and more powerful.
