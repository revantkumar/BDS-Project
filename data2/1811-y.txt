Robert White I cannot understand why we would want to import workers and train them rather than train and hire our own citizens. If everyone had a job and the lack of workers was causing major problems for our economy, it might be worth considering. But with so many American citizens unemployed, underemployed, not attached to the workforce and discouraged, it seems like yet another case of our own government favoring non-Americans and non-citizens over our citizens and voters.
