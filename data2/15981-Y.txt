I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:
1.International students are making huge contributions to our country. Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. 
2.Most of international students works in tech area,which most of Americans don't want to do.What's more,most of international student did good job in these areas,it helps US to keep its leadership.
So opt extension is beneficial for US.
