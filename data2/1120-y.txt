Rohit Sharma I totally support this proposed rule of extending OPT extension to 24 months. US Education system and its Graduate and Ph.D. Programs largely depend on International students. Absence of OPT extension will be a big turn off for International students which would result in decreasing international applications. It would be a big blow to the US Education System and in turn US economy if people withdraw there interest in such large numbers. 

US is largely a mixed democracy where people of all faith and community can come and flourish together. That's what America is all about. Not extending OPT will undermine this notion. Reiterating, I completely support OPT extension.
