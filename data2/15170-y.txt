Evan McLaren I am disappointed to learn about DHS's new regulation to greatly increase the number of foreign STEM-degree holders permitted to work in the United States under the Optional Practical Training Program.

In the present employment market especially, our government should be careful to protect the job prospects of its own citizens. This should be the case in any economic climate, but it is well known that American workers today are in a vulnerable position. In the United States, the wages of tech workers have been flat for several years, and thousands of American STEM-degree holders are out of work.

It would have been proper, under the law, for this program to have been entirely vacated. In the future, judges and government officials ought to explain to the American people the basis for their authority to allow foreign students to work while holding nothing more than student visas.

In addition to the employment issues, it is notable that employers who hire foreign students under this program will avoid paying employment taxes. Frankly this exposes a cynical motivation behind the expensive lobbying effort waged by employers in support of increasing the number of OPT visas. As if the detriment to American workers were not obvious enough, they are being harmed both coming and going--suffering from their jobs being taken by foreign workers, they then can anticipate less support from a government that has, in effect, given large corporations generous tax breaks.

My wife happens to be a green card holder--she and I were careful to complete the appropriate applications and pay the required fees so that she could gain her work and residence statuses through established legal channels. It is disheartening to both of us, and, I am sure, to many similar legal immigrants, so observe the system being treated cynically, against the national interest.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment and hope that my remarks will be taken seriously.
