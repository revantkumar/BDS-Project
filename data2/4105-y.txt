Yushi Liu I strongly support to extend STEM OPT program. Firstly, from economic consideration, international students pay much higher tuition than domestic students, which helps the university in United States to make a balance. The declination of STEM OPT extension program would greatly discourage international students to apply American universities. This is a huge disaster to American higher education. Secondly, extension of OPT does not mean issue more visas and give more people to citizenship. It only means American companies could hire international students for longer time, which benefits technology of America significantly.
