i completely support in increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months from current 17 months. i believe this proposed rule is really necessary for currents students and future students to obtain practical training. Every school has to provide necessary information on OPT to students so that they will be completely aware of every rule. This is also imperative to maintain nation's economic, scientific and technological competitiveness.
