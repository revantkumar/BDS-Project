I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Foreigners are making great contributions to America. Looking at most of the world leading companies, especially in IT industry, at least half of the workers are foreigners. Without them, America cannot keep its world leading status.

2. Foreigners are not competing with natives. Most of foreigners are engineers, which is an rather hard job that most natives do not want to do. Looking at the universities' graduate schools, about half of their students are foreigners and some universities nearly has graduate schools of all foreigners. The natives think engineering is too hard and do not want to learn it.
