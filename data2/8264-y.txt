Venkata Shanmukha Teja Kala Looking at increasing number of H1 work visa applications from outside the USA , the possibility of getting a work visa for an F1 student with 12 months OPT without any STEM extension will be very little. Because of this lots of students who pursue their higher education from top tier institutes in the USA (some of them will also avail scholarships from the government) will have to leave the country. So, I am supporting the 24 month STEM extension which allows the students to work in USA after 12 months without work visa, at the same time would help to innovate in science and technology which America is bringing to the world.
