I totally agree with improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students with STEM. Obviously, it is a win-win policy for both the American Finance and the students. From the financial environment, STEM nonimmigrant students play a great role and their study level will make very important contribution to the whole society, as we know, among all the STEM students, international students cover the large number of them, expending the training opportunities also means hiring more excellent professionals. 
As the same time, students can apply their knowledge directly to the job after the graduation, it is the golden chance to combine their study with the practice.
Thus, the policy is really great for both the American society and all the nonimmigrant students.
