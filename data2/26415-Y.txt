I strongly support this rule. I was a research intern at Microsoft Research, and know well that most research programs last longer than 2 years. It is very harmful for a research project in industry to change the research team. As most researchers and engineers at Microsoft are non-citizens, and many of them are STEM students in OPT period, failure to extend the OPT will force them to leave the team and go to other countries. These students are genius young researchers, and are contributing many cutting edge researches to US. If they go to other countries, it will definitely be a huge loss for US.
