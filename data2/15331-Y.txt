I strongly support the the OPT extension for STEM degrees policy because the dominating power of the United States is essentially rooted in its significant advantages in science, technologies and higher education, which has been based on and will be in the future strengthened by attracting the top talents from all over the world. This OPT extension for STEM degrees will certainly reassure companies, research institutes, universities and all other organizations which aim to move the world-leading science and cutting-technologies forward, to find the qualified and beyond to fulfill such objectives. In this way the U.S. could maintain its advantages.
