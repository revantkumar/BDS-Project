Pam Martin As an American citizen, I am STRONGLY opposed to expanding OPT, Optional Practical Training program . I would prefer it be abolished totally. 

It puts downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. And Social Security will be losing about $1Billion a year. 

Three-quarters of American citizen college graduates with a degree in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) currently have not been able to secure employment in their chosen fields.

Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it. Aren't these Tech companies in America WEALTHY ENOUGH????? 

This program has never been authorized by Congress
