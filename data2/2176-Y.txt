I strongly support this OPT extension rule for the following reasons:

1. It's important to emphasize the american spirit which is everyone has equal chance to change their lives and the world. The students who came to this country study hard deserves more time to practice what they learn in school.

2. For US economy, it is also good to have those talented foreign people work in IT area or high tech area.

3. the longer OPT extend, the more talented foreign people come US to study, which is good for US education and economy.
