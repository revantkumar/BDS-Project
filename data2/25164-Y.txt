Hard to imagine an America without immigration. Everyone in America are all immigrants from Europe or Asia. It seems stupid for a group of immigrants to object to a immigration policy. Of course, more native will face more intense competition. But we all know Catfish Effect will make all native live better. So, why don't we reconsider why we oppose OPT? Because this policy is not harmful to this country or just because we are lazy and afraid of competition
