I strongly support this STEM extension rule.
1. As US's traditional, it will every one a equal chance. We should give those students
an opportunity to work for US, especially for those who has STEM degree.
2. It's a really good for US economy, especially in IT company. There highly need and depends on those talented people to work. Keep those foreign students in US absolutely good for this country.
3. If US could not keep those high level people, they would go to other country, and it would make negative effect in the future for the US
