I'm willing to support the proposal to pass this stage. Based on the record, every year, there are much more applicants competing each other for a H1B visa. This means the foreign employee number is decided by company's need instead of the visa openings. This extension will actually make every one has equal chance to get a H1B and make the company pay more attention on finding the employee they need instead of considering the possibility of getting a H1B visa. This will make our company has more talented people and make more profit to the whole society.
