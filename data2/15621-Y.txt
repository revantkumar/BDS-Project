I am writing this comment in support of the 24-month OPT extension. First the OPT extension did not rule out the opportunity for US citizens to look for jobs in the fields of STEM. With more international students working at fields mentioned above, even more jobs will be created due to the expansion and bloom of the science and technology industry. Looking back in the history, the US is a nation who is always welcome to people from other countries, from Albert Einstein in the past to Aziz Sancar who won 2015 Nobel prize. It is because of the joint contribution of both US citizens and non-US citizens that it is now the biggest economy in the world. Second, if many international students who are doing research or employed by scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics institutions and companies have to terminate their work because of the OPT extension, it will not only be a loss to themselves but also to the institutions and companies. Last but not least, the great diversity that international students bring to the US also prevented biased opinions and partial behaviors in this country.
