This proposal is very good and important to US. In the past decade, many foreign STEM talents came to US and one important reason is that this country provides better training opportunities than any other countries. The high-tech industry also needs the support of those STEM talents. The 12+24 month opt period is very important, since many STEM projects need more than one year to develop. It will be every ineffective, if a project has to be ceased due to the worker's opt is expired. I am a Chinese STEM student and I will go back to China since my family is there. Before returning to China, If I could get 3 years working experience, I will be very competitive in the Chinese job market.
