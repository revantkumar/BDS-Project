As a non-resident alien Ph.D. candidate, I strongly support the 24-month STEM OPT. Since a large percent of the graduate students in STEM majors are from foreign countries, US companies and research institutions will face huge loss without them. Therefore, it is important to attract more foreign students to come and study. OPT extension provides a huge incentive. Moreover, with the extension, students are allowed to accumulate more working experience and contribute more back to the industry and academia. Overall, it is beneficial to the advance of technology and civilization.
