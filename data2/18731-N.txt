Why is it that our government is more concerned about employing foreign workers than it is about employing American citizens? Since when does our government represent foreigners over Americans. The only reason Obama/Bush have pushed this insane policy is to "fundamentally transform" our country to a third world country. Unemployment of American STEM workers is high and they're not being hired by US companies, because foreign works make much less and are made to work longer hours. This fact is reflected in the TRUE UNEMPLOYMENT numbers within the U.S. "We the People" know what's going on with our government/officials and it's unacceptable. We demand our children and grand children have the ability to obtain gainful employment within the U.S. Americans aren't "stupid " or "lazy" or "uneducated" as we're regularly told by our elected officials. Politicians on the other hand, they're all of the above; if I may add one more - they're greedy. As I'm sure there are pay-offs involved in the deceit and job give away scams. We're awake and we'll not stop until the deceit and non-sense from our government and elected officials ends.
