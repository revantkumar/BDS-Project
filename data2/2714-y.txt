Arano Mark According to the description of this policy, I think expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees are very necessary. 

The international students bring huge amount of profit for the American companies and the societies. And also they solve the problem that lacking of high educated STEM degrees related jobs. If you go to any STEM related degree colleges you will find out most of the students are from other countries. And most of them are very hard working and have good performance within their area. That is the main reason why there are so many American companies would like to hire them. It's not because the companies want to pay less money for their employees. Also people from all around the world bring their own culture to the US, which make the universities multiculture. That is very important for the American universities. If them stop providing long term OPT time, there will not be a lot of international students want to come here to study. Because they cannot get enough work experience after them graduate. 

According to the description, 2 years of OPT extension is very important. STEM degree related jobs need longer time to make employees to get used to their work. And then, employees can full show their potential and produce profit for their companies. 

As for some people say American companies should hire American people rather international students. I want to say, companies need to focus on the profit which means they would like to hire the right people rather some random people who has bad performance. And I can understand that those companies also need to consider the social contribution to some extend. And we can see there are a lot of American people working in STEM related area. Also there are more companies only hire American citizenship. So I did not see a big conflict between American employees and international students.
