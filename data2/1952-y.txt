Jiahong Yan I strongly support the proposed regulation, because it will be benefit for both F-1 students and US society. 

1. The proposed visa regulation can provide F-1 student with a chance to obtain practical experience outside the classroom, which can help their career development in the future. 

2. The involvement of F-1 students can enhance the U.S. workforce, as most of the F-1 students are well-educated. The students obtain knowledge from U.S. higher education institutes and can be a great resource for U.S society development. 

3. Worldwide, increasing countries are open to attract international talents and provide equal opportunities that allow international talents to make contributions to the society. U.S should be one of these countries, instead of take actions as opposite. 

4. One of the reasons for the success of U.S. is its openness and diversity. U.S. sets no limitation for personal success, no matter where they come or what are their background. The F-1 students should be provide the equal opportunities for the success and help U.S. prosperous.

Please consider the proposed regulation, and don't shut down the door for people from behind.
