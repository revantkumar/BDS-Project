Rob Meyer In 2002, a report from the Development Research Center of the State Council found that since 1992 China had introduced more than 10,000 experts and 2,000 technical projects from Russia and other former Soviet Union countries. A 2006 report stated that since 2006, more than 2,000 academics and experts from Ukraine had been invited to China.

Apart from purchasing the Varyag, China's first aircraft carrier which it transformed into the Liaoning, China has also cooperated with Ukraine over the DN/DA-80 gas turbines in the Chinese Aegis destroyer, the 6TD-2E diesel engine for the Al-Khalid tank developed by China for Pakistan, and the AI-222 turbofan engines in the L-15 advanced training aircraft, as well as guided missile technology [1]. 

Imagine if there is no OPT extension, a huge number of talented people will be forced to contribute to countries like China. Chinese companies like Huawei already exceed Cisco [2]. If important computer components like routers are made by Chinese companies, they will impose a great threat to world order. It is easy to name many other Chinese companies like Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, AVIC, etc.

Pres. Obama has announced that he will expand his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to an estimated 5-6 million illegal aliens. The DACA program granted amnesty and work permits to approximately 500,000 illegal aliens [3]. Remember most of these illegal aliens DO NOT HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. It is extremely expensive to train a certain person to earn a college or advanced degree. Imagine the amount of money spent in different training programs and the personal efforts devoted, which is invaluable. 

So now we granted work permits to 500,000 illegal aliens (+ 5 to 6 millions more) and try to stop a two year training period for all elite international students who holds a college or advanced degree? So who's to blame for all the problems in this country?
