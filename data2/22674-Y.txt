I totally support this proposal for following reasons,

1. The most important part for foreign students who studying abroad is practice. Learning knowledge can be everywhere, however, the training opportunities is the most precious thing for experience of studying abroad. It can correspond well with what you have learned in the university, and it is helpful for talented foreign students to improve their ability in that environment.

2. The foreign students play an important role in improving America economy. Most talanted foreign students, especially for who has Master or PH.D. degree, will have oppotunities to work in IT industry, engineering, technology field and so on, they have the same knowledge as native students, but because of different culture, they can see the problem from more aspect, handle it in many different ways, so they would become the potential treasure of America, and it is hard to think about the American economy if there is no foreign students work here in the future.

3. America could attract more foreign talented students from the world if having more training opportunities. which is beneficial to both side.
