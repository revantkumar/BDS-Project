As an international student, I support the OPT-extension policy to be continued.

I found many U.S. citizens be objective to it, as they believed the STEM students are competing with them for jobs. In my opinion though, they are very short-sighted. 

They realized that U.S. is wealthy and advanced in sciences and technologies, but neglected the contributions from immigrants and the benefit coming from competitions. It sounds bad, but a country will go stale without external stimulations. Can you imagine a world that every citizen is granted to have a job? Then a large portion of workers will simply to unqualified work since they have little chance to lose their jobs. If that's the case, U.S. will be very soon surpassed by other entities. For a country to stay active, everyone has to embrace challenges. One can shy away from challenges for a while, but I've never seen anyone, who can shy away from challenges forever. 

STEM students are going to contribute heavily on the development of sciences and technologies, and improve everyone's life quality. While writing this comment, I spent 5 min, to google the term "US immigrant inventors", and google, which BTW is invented by an immigrant-Sergey Brin, brought me to this web page "A day without immigrant-made inventions". Among those inventions, there are phones, automatic transmission, ATM, HDTV and a variety of medications and medical devices. Since these inventions benefited every people, I foresee the new generation of STEM students be equally productive, and their inventions will again improve the life-quality for every citizens.
