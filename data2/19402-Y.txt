I strongly support the proposed rule. First of all, F-1 students have made undeniable contributions to the U.S. economy, culture, and diversity through out the past decades, and the rule would keep such positive factor, as well as attracting more talented students to come to U.S..
Moreover, the most talented F-1 students would have more chances to win the H1B visa lotteries with the extended OPT, who carry the potentials of being the ground-breaking engineers/scientists in their fields. The proposed rule would effectively reduce the risk that we fail to keep the next great innovations in America due to visa issues.
