As I see it OPT is not working for a number of reasons at any level. This needs to be voted out.

Our legal American workers and students should not be tossed aside as if they do not matter. They do. I have 1 college graduate nephew that is having trouble getting work. 

With OPT this problem is not solved and an even bigger problem results. They have even more competition with all the illegals here looking for work. This is not ethical.

Vote this out. Don't make a bad problem grow even worse. Things are bad enough now, its sickening.
