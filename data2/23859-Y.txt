This is a blatant discrimination against the talented graduates from the non-STEM fields. These folks are equally relevant and important to the progress of the US economy as compared to the STEM graduates. Most of them have the potential to become entrepreneurs and create jobs and revenue for the nation. Majority of them acquire STEM degree back in their countries and pursue specialized degrees like MBA in the US thus making them proficient in technical as well as managerial skills and have an edge over the STEM candidates without such management education. Additionally, this will deter talented individuals from applying to non-STEM degrees in the US thus causing a revenue loss to the US universities and the economy overall. I believe graduates from STEM as well as non-STEM fields should be given equal opportunities as both them are assets to the nation.
