I strongly support maintaining the expansion of OPT for STEM degree holders and urge policy makers to go beyond that.
After being a PhD F1 student in the United States at University of Wisconsin-Madison, I applied for my OPT and then it's extension as I was working as a researcher at Stanford University and expanding my skills. The period of OPT STEM extension gave me the opportunity to complete my training outside the school and encouraged me to stay in the United States. I applied for my permanent residency status during my OPT extension time. Last week I received my green card, officially moving beyond my amazing experience as an OPT-STEM authorization holder. Please keep the good law on the books and expand it to give more chances to people like me.
