I strongly support this rule of OPT extension. As a graduate student who chose to study STEM in the US, I chose to study here mainly because of the OPT and OPT extension policy. Usually in my field, after completion of PhD, 2~3 years of postdoctoral training is necessary before we can get a faculty position. So 1 year OPT is too short. OPT extension of 24 months will be perfect for PhD to complete their postdoctoral project.
