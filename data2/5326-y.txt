Jerry Kim The new proposal is a really good idea. It enhances the economy, and also attracts more talents to come to the US and contribute to this country. That is why the US such strong in the world, because it is very diverse. Imaging if all the STEM students lost their chance to work and learn in the companies, they would not coming here any more. That is such a lost for the country. 

I've read some comments given by the opponents. They said they pay tax and those jobs have to be kept for them. I just want to ask: "Who doesn't?" All the STEM students working in the US, they pay tax as well. In some distance, they pay more than citizens. They are just asking to be treated fairly. And some one said he is a PHD and he has to work in a supermarket and make $10/h, because those students took his job. What a joke! Let's assuming this story is real. E-verified company treats people equally, if both you and a STEM student are over qualified, then what is wrong with the company to hair a foreigner? The answer has to be that there are not enough qualified STEM workers in the US. So, I strongly agree with the new proposal to extend the OPT extension to 24 months.
