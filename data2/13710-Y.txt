I strongly agree that expanding training opportunities for F1 no immigrant student with STEM degrees to have 24 months training in the United States. First of all, the international students com from countries all over the world, the reason they do it is because they want to learn the better technique or professional subjects. But, learning is not just for studying, but also hand on experience. Sometimes you even learn more during the internship than just reading the book. Also, while the international student doing the OPT program, they bring what they learn from the school to the company. The company can not only received the newer knowledges or techniques soon, but also can have the skills that the international student brought to the country. Which is good for American economy. Just like Canada, they took many high technique people to their country to help out the high skills work demand, they save a lots of money to train people, and also raise their economy at the same time. I really think United Stare should keep international students for 24 extant ion months. After three years, the United Stares can have the new students to take those shits. This way, We can have fewer people to immigrat and also got the talent people that we need.
