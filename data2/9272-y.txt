Leo L I strongly support this rule.

I am an international STEM student. I have practiced 6 month interview problems to find an internship. I applied more than 150 companies. I still remember I passed 2 phone screen of a company and they told me I did an excellent job during the interview. 

However, I didn't hear them in two weeks. You know what, in a Friday afternoon, they asked me whether I am an US citizen. What's next is a simple "Bye".

International students are not stealing jobs from American citizens. American citizens can find a decent offer way easier than international student.
