I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons and concerns:

First of all, there is almost no doubt that how much contributions the international students have made to the US. Just take a glance at the companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc., you could see a lot of international employees. Could you really imagine that these companies would run smoothy without international employees. 

Secondly, the STEM policy is actually helping US citizens, since the policy restricts the international students working only in authorized E-verified companies with the same majors. So, the international students would not have any competition with the US citizens in other aspects. 

Thirdly, there are many comments claiming that the companies are hiring international students because they are cheaper. However, there is really no evidence to support this. As we all know, the IT companies have to pay at least 200,000 as a total package per year to hire a well educated computer scientists. So, the reason these comments mentioned is not solid.

Please take all my comments in consideration. 

Thanks.
