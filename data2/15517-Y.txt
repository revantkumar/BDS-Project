I strongly support this OPT Extension for the following reason:
1) Hiring STEM student doesn't hinder hiring American people because most of the job can not find qualified American applicant. That's why the extension only applies to STEM rather than all disciplines.
2) STEM graduates creates hugely value for the American economy and create new job opportunities for American people.
3) Allowing these STEM graduates return their countries after study will hurt our economy and will help their mother counties. Eventually, it will hurt American economy.
