Changshuo Gao OPT extension is a great thing for me who currently use F1 visa working in United States. As a software developer, my software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, I cannot finish those projects before I lose my Visa. 
As a international student, I would return back China eventually. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China and the educational industry of United States will have a good Reputation from me. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US industries and international STEM talents.
