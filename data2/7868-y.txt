Manjusha Natarajan I fully support this rule as it is beneficial for both the American employers and the STEM degree students. The students cannot take advantage of the training they received by paying several thousand dollars for STEM advanced degrees in the U.S if they get only 12 months to apply their skills. It is also a hassle for companies to train them and let them go in 12 months and repeat the same process with the replacement. So, in order to justify the OPT program and H1-B cap gap this new rule is essential for the entire job ecosystem and subsequently the economy. Several thousand international students have come to the United States for higher education factoring the STEM extension in their plans and vacating this rule abruptly would cause huge losses in many students and their families' lives. I conclude by saying that approving this rule is crucial for all the stakeholders involved.

Thanks!
