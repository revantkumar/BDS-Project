I strongly support the extension.
Foreign technological workers can grow the US economy. They pay tax while working. Their work also create a lot of new job positions for the US. 
They use what they learned from university to help the US stronger and more competitive in technological area than other country. What if these talent students learn top technologies and go back to their own country? The US will lose the top competitive step by step. 
At this time, if we don't let them have the extension. At another time, we can just use the same reason to avoid them having green card. Furthermore, we maybe force all foreign students to go back to their home countries after graduation. At this situation, the US will soon lose its technological advantages. It might be as same as Argentina in 19 century, avoiding immigration and leading to decay.
