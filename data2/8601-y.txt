Donald Hammers I really do not understand why the government is undermining qualified U.S. citizens and recent college graduates for U.S. jobs. We don't need all those foreign students and foreign graduates working in this country. We have plenty of our own graduates that can fill those jobs and need those jobs. Forget the foreign and start working on getting the domestic workers into jobs. That is the only way to keep this country competitive in the world market place.
