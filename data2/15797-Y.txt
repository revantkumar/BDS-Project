I strongly support this rule. 

United States always knows how to absorb best talent from the world into it. This is why United States are on top of the world. United States also spent huge amount of fund into international STEM student. It would be a pity as well as a loss for the country if United States force those smart and talented students back to their own countries. Americans' lost is other countries' gain. Students back to their own countries will make huge contribution to their own countries. The firms in their own countries will become inevitable competitors to United States' firm. Americans will lose more jobs once this becomes true.
