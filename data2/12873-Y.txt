I strongly support the Stem opt extension and its 24 months' period. This rule not only benefits the international students who come to our country for educationbut also helps our economy and growth of technology industry.

In our company there are many native and international students working in reseaech and analytical area and they are collaborating to make contributions to the whole company. If the extension was voidedwe would lose them immediatelywhich definitely would have very bad impact on our company. Also less student would come to US for advanced educationinstead they go to EnglandCanada where they don't have to worry about the Visa. Then it would be even hard for us to hire people.

So I am submitting this comment on the behalf of our company and all our colleaguesWe need the OPT extension and which would absolutely help the country and the growth of industry.
Thank you.
