Not only are companies abusing H-1B and OPT but foreigners are using them simply to stay longer in this country at taxpayers and American workers expense. Any proposals in these times must diligently consider the American citizen/worker above all else. Stop the non-sense. It is the American people you work for not corporations nor politicians that have motives other than that of the people.
