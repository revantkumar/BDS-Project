Carmine Di Giacomo I am a high-tech worker in South Dakota. I am in fact self-employed. Contrary to the political BS being spewed, there are plenty of qualified US citizens employed, and looking for employment, in the high-tech fields.
Approving an increase in the amount of time foreign workers can spend in the US is tantamount to taking employment from US citizens.
Taking employment, stealing jobs, depriving them of a decent livelihood, screwing them over. Now matter what you call it, it all amounts to the same thing. Unemployed or under-employed, qualified, US citizens.
