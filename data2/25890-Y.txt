NO!

Non-immigrant Students were supposed to come to this country, get an education, and then return to their country and make their country better. 

The United States has many, many people who qualify for the sort of support you provide the illegal aliens and Non-immigrant Students. The United States has many, many unemployed graduates who cannot find a job. 

The Question becomes: will congress support the non-immigrants, or the Citizens of this country. If they do support the illegal aliens and non-immigrants, how do we get rid of this congress and the people who are giving our jobs away, and NOT supporting the taxpayers.

If there is a shortage of workers wherein this program is required, then provide the Labor Department reports that tell us you are correct. At this time, however, there are NO such reports.

SO! NO!
