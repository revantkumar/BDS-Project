I personally believe it time to put Americans back to work. Enough of importing Foreign workers to fill these jobs in this Country.
It's time that Congress and the Senate stood up to this Administration and do what right for the American people. So Ladies and Gentleman,
lets start standing up for those in this Country who could use a job. Look what this President did today, cancelling the pipeline
that could have meant thousands of new jobs.
