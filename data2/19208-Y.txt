My question; Do the countries of these foreign students give US grads a work visa?

Also by extending this program we opened a can of worms for international students who claimed to be returning to their home countries to stay in the U.S. 

It is not illegal, but it is unethical, they lied. 

Do we want liars? Absolutely not. 

I vote against this proposal.
