I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Keeping the best brains in the UNITED STATES is important to the future of this country. If our country still wants to lead the world, then we should not push those talents away. The U.S. is the city up the hill, we should never lose, including this competition of getting more great scientists, engineers, and experts.

In addition, OPT is an important factor to make the U.S. universities so welcomed and popular in the world. If we can attract a lot of international students here, then it will be a great booming to our country's economy. The international students who can afford expensive tuition here are great consumers. They pay apartment rent, go to restaurants, do shopping, pay all kinds of bills, and buy decent cars. All of these bring new job opportunities to the people from coast to coast.
