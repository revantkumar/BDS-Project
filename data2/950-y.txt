Lina Gebson Support the OPT extension rule. Not only 24 months but should ensure them enough time until they win the H1-b lottery. A well educated worker should not be threw out of the country after we educate them. We should give these brilliant and young people a good path to chase their America dream. I have seen lots of STEM students joining great companies and institutions and they all did a good job. They should be put on the highest priority in the immigrant system since they have already experienced our education system and have no problem to get along with the culture.
