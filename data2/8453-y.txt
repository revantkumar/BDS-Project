xiaotiane xin Without OPT extending, many F1 students will be forced to leave their current companies soon. They are probably responsible for the main parts of important projects, like maintaining the whole company's system, developing a very profitable product for companies.. 

Loss of them extremely slow down or even shut down the whole progress since it is extremely hard to find someone who can take over the responsibilities right on, and companies need to sacrifice extra administrate resources and valuable time to train them as well. Normally, recruiting someone qualified needs about at least one month, then training them for making sure they understand and apply well at work needs about 3 months. During these 4 months, company's function will be slow, and furthermore it will influence their services, then decreasing profits. And this situation will be very easily seen for some big tech companies who hired lots of F1 holders.

All above statements are based on the assumption of company could find someone, the worse case is that they cannot find that many competitive employee, that will result in a serious consequence for the whole company, then influence the whole society. So I think 24 months extension and Cap-Gap Relief will help avoid unnecessary economic loss. Thank you so much for reading this.
