Hi all,

I strongly support this rule. Today's America is shaped by migrations. In general,it is human nature to be threatened by outsiders. I read somewhere that even Benjamin Franklin was scared that Germans would over-flood this country. Most of immigrants, which come to US are educated people. They build companies, which is evidently a plus point for any society. I think we must rise above this petty level of thinking that these outsiders are going to steal our jobs and steal food from children's mouth. World is becoming one place. Brian Acton, Vinod Khosla ,Narinder Singh Kapany are few names of immigrants in US who did something wonderful in their respective fields and the whole world benefits from them. Closed hearts don't go anywhere, they die a lonely death and on the other hand ,open hearts let you travel places across world. 

Thanks,
Sunny
