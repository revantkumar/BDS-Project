I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. 

First, US companies rely on international workforce to create values for themselves, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. This also help them stay competitive among international companies, increasing their market shares.

Second, this help US colleges to get better students and better funding program from all over the world. 

This is win-win. Do it! Thanks.
