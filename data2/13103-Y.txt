This is a desperately needed rule, which will also be serving the best interest of United State. Take myself as an example. I am a PhD student in Columbia University, majoring in Geophysics. All of my tuition has been paid by grants from National Science Foundation (NSF) and I am receiving a monthly salary as a graduate research assistant from the same source. What I am saying is that I am receiving very good education and training in US and that is all paid by US government.

Many oil/gas companies need well-educated people like me to use advanced techniques to lower the risk in oil/gas exploration. If I could not get OPT extension, probably no companies in US will hire me, simply because I could be forced to leave this country in 1 year. However, for people like me, who received top-level education and training in US, we will not be jobless when we go back to our mother country. Then we will work for the competitors of US companies and use the knowledge that we learned in US (again, paid by US government) to compete with US workers. I talked with my American friends and classmates about this, none of them think this is a smart idea. Instead, they think it will be the most stupid police to send me back to China, after I have been paid by US government to receive high education in US.
