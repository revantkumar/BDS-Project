I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1.United States is a country of free spirit and every body comes to this country deserves equal opportunities. And all international students need are only opportunities of practicing their skills in industry rather than academic atmosphere. 
2.A lot of excellent researchers, scientists, writers, artists or faculties in the universities used to be international students from all over the world. Eventually they stay in United States and make their talents useful and helpful for this country. This shows a open immigration policy can keep US's national power on the top of the world because all those talented people can stay and make this country a better and more innovative place, not only technologically but also spiritually.
