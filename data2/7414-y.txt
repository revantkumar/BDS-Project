Wenpei Miao In my point of view, OPT will have great benefit to the whole American society. This policy will give much more chances to foreign students to get a job in US, which will create more wealth to this country and also the whole world. 

First, America has the most advanced environment that gives these people the opportunities to make innovations and contribution to the world. 
Second, many objectors thought that foreigners would get the jobs that were belonging to native Americans. While I don't think so. Because when there are creations in the society, there will certainly be more and more jobs available for all people. One job is taken, tens of jobs will be created.

So, I really think opt is a benefit to both Americans and foreigner students.
