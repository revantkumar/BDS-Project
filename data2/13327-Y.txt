I strongly support this proposal.

It is not easy to find a job as an international student, and even harder to find a E-verify company which would like to sponsor H1B visa. I really believe that students who can make through this step are very competitive in the position. It is crucial to let them go just because of unlucky in the lottery.

US citizens still have great advantage regardless of this proposal, since H1B and E-verify requirement will filter out most of interview opportunities for international students. I don't think that is a threat to US citizens and those who can find a job deserve a peace of mind to work in the U.S.

Thanks!
