OPT program and OPT extension definitely helps US with its economy growing. On one hand, OPT and OPT extension make US educations more attractive to international students. Every years, millions and millions dollar of tuition were paid by international students. On the other hand, OPT program give academic institutes and industrial companies more chances to select the employees they really want and really need. There is only certain amount of employment visa issued every year. No matter how many OPT students are there, the number of H1-B visa doesn't increase every year. That's been saying, the OPT or OPT extension put very minimal hurt on US workers. 

I strongly support OPT extension program. USA is a great country because it used to accept all the elites and brilliant people from the world. American dream won't exist if this country start to fear for newcomers.
