Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

As a Professional Engineer with the equivalent of over 10 years of College and post graduate training, I'm having a problem getting a job. There are too many less educated applicants willing to work for low wages most from foreign nations with poor english skills.

I oppose this new rule which would flood the market for technical positions. We have enough foreign applicants now, far more that the actual job openings.
