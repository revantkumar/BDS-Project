Henry Hulab First, let me express my condolence towards the people in Paris. I didn't intend to come here to post this comment to backup STEM extension until I saw what happened in Paris. Neither do I want to comment on politics in Europe. 

My only words is let's have more science, technology, higher education, and most importantly conscience in U.S..
