I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension. I think this increased period of practical training is the most important for students to fully develop their skills. Because the application of what they have learnt is the only learning that remains with them. When they are working hard for a pursuit of knowledge they seek, they deserve enough opportunities for the real learning.
