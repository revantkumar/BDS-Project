OPT extension is REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT for STEM students, as it is for me. I rely on it to get an working visa so that I can stay and work at USA a little longer. USA is a great country, I've learned and observed a lot from the people, school and friends here, I really want to stay here longer, trying to apply what I've learned to help make a better future USA. If this regulation would be abandoned by any chance, countless of students will need to go back home within a year, no matter how hard they work, how brilliant they are, how eager they want to be in the tech company and make their own contributions, there is no chance for them. so PLEASE SUPPORT AND APPROVE THIS REGULATION!
