Dear all who oppose STEM OPT extensions:

Let me tell you who you should really go after:

Those are the guys robbing jobs from you. Those are the guys who force people like me, who receives an advanced degree from US and want to stay, work and contribute, to go for OPT extension.

Please open your eyes and see the REAL PROBLEM. Wake the f*** up.
