Being a student in graduate school, I am so gald to study in America, however, in the meantime I am also impressed by the difficult situation finding a job here with F1 visa. The opt gives me a good chance to work here, being a stem even give me much more long time than other people to get many internship as I can so I can learn the cultural here and even work here to get a better life.
