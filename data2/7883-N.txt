This rule change is another example of how big business is running amok in our government. During a time when a lot of working Americans including STEM professional with decades of experience are unemployed, our government is pushing for more extensions to foreign workers. This is obviously at the behest of the corporate puppet masters of our "government" and I have to literally place government in quotes as we do not have a representative democracy with examples like this rule change. If our representatives were doing the peoples will and not being under the purse strings of big business then we would not have this utterly stupid rule change being proposed.
