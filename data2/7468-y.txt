Jack Ma I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. Nowadays, international student create significant values to many US tech companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.
