The Department of Homeland Security's proposed Optional Practical Training plan is harmful to significant classes of U.S. citizens & comes at a time & in economic & security circumstances in the United States of America that make it dangerous & destructive to an extreme degree--to the point of national suicide--& is thus shockingly irrational. This proposed plan/program will harm particularly young Americans who are seeking employment & especially those who are currently studying in the fields of interest in colleges & universities, & harms Americans who are at risk of losing their jobs owing to downsizing & the many other economic stringencies affecting this country today. It is tantamount to the theft of hard-earned money sacrificed over the last 2 generations of Americans to plan for a decent retirement, & worse still it would import thousands of persons from countries with segments of the population that have proven to be enemies of the United States, & thus unacceptably heightens the risk of terrorism. This country is already awash with millions of persons who are here illegally & others who are either totally or at least insufficiently unaccounted for insofar as national security is concerned. 
Given the current political climate of near-total disenfranchisement of loyal U.S. citizens, my comments will undoubtedly make no difference & the terrible OPT travesty will be ramrodded through to the further devastation of our country, but one hopes that there are sufficient good Americans who will listen & perhaps do the right thing & manage to keep the OPT from becoming a reality.
