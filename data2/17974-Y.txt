The OPT extension is very critical to both the US economy and hundreds of thousands of foreign students who are studying in US as well. The high technology companies such as Silicon Valley have a high demand of employees with advanced degree in STEM. However, it is not possible to fill the high demand without hiring international students. The international students do not fight with US employees in those positions since there are not so enough qualified US employees. OPT is a good opportunity for high tech company to train fresh graduates and hire the best among them. Nowadays H1B cap is far less than the demands which force a huge number of qualified students leaving USA which also damages the US economy. So the OPT extension is really urgent and please act now.
