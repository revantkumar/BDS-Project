Guyue Ji I strongly support the proposal for 24 month OPT.
As an international student I am working with my OPT right now. Even though it is only half a year since I started to work, I have proved myself by showing the team that I am a quick learner, a team player and I can meet the client's request with quality, meanwhile, I am learning from my colleagues every day and the skills I obtained from school get enhanced. I am benefiting from the OPT program and so does my company.
