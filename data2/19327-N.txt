After working over 40 years to attain a position paying (with benefits) over $100,000 a year, I retired in order to open a space for younger people. I could have worked another 10 plus years and hate to think that my decision would open the door for a foreign worker to displace a new grad working in my field of work. Companies are businesses for profit and the least amount of overhead increases their bottom line. If our government cannot protect the qualified American worker we need a change in government. Someone should publish a list of those businesses/employers that employ these foreign workers so the American consumer can make an informed decision on where they wish to spend their money.
