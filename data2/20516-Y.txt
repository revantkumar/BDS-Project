I STRONGLY support this policy!!!

Immigrants with high degrees are great workforce for USA. Their high intellectual power and high productivity can help the economy and improve the well-being of the society.

The STEM students enjoyed education resources of this country, they should work for this country.

The competition induced by STEM immigrants is negligible comparing to the potential jobs they can create. The high-tech manpower can improve the economy, and hence the employment market. More jobs will be created with help from STEM immigrants.
