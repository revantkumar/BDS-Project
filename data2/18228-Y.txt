I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. US should keep its competitiveness for international students. Although States has the best education resources in the world, other countries like UK, Canada, Australia, etc. also trying to attract international students by various policies. Training program is definitely one of them. Current one year OPT period is obviously not long enough since students can only get one chance to get a H1-B visa. If the proposal couldn't pass, many students might prefer to choose other countries which could provide a better training program and have a higher chance to get a working visa.

2. Best companies need best new employees all over the world. There is no doubt that US has the world's best companies in STEM field. However, it will be a pity for them if they cannot hire the best college graduates just because OPT is not long enough and students could not get a working visa. In the world's top 10 Internet companies, China already has four places. In an international age like today, talents are the most important factor for every single company and especially the best ones. If companies like Google or Facebook could not hire the best talents due to their identity, it would definitely be a big loss of the US. The OPT extension is obviously a good way to attract the talents all over the world.

3. This proposal will NOT affect US citizens' benefit. For a company to hire an international candidate, it has to show that they cannot find a US candidate first. US citizens always has a higher priority than internationals. Taking more talents from other countries to contribute the US will only make US stronger and this in turn, would definitely bring huge benefit to US citizens.
