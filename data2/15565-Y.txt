I strongly support this proposal. Although competition does exist, however, a fierce competition among STEM, mostly the high-tech areas, would make US more competitive and attractive than any countries in the world. International students with STEM degree would only find a job in related areas and regulated by relevant rules, and innovations benefitted from STEM international students in those areas can definitely create more jobs for Americans.
