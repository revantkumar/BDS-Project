I support the proposal to improve and expand training opportunities for F1 students.

My comment specifically deals with the influence the proposal will have on solar research/industry. Solar companies in the U.S. have been experiencing hard times due to the fact that the levelized cost of installing a solar panel on one's roof is still much higher than the price of grid electricity. Nevertheless, solar industry is still growing - together with the demand of solar panels - in the past few years due to policies like solar tax incentives. Unfortunately, this tax credit will expire in 2016 (http://solar.gwu.edu/q-a/will-congress-extend-solar-tax-incentives-expiring-2016) and a lot of policymakers in California don't believe it will be extended. 

Due to the expiration of the tax credit, solar companies in U.S. will definitely experience another critical moment because of the shrinking demand. Since solar energy is a highly important energy source, and a breakthrough in the solar research may reduce the cost of solar panels so that they can again survive even without solar tax incentives, providing enough support to solar researchers/companies is crucial. A lot of the solar researchers in U.S. are international students (e.g. http://yylab.seas.ucla.edu/members.html). Expanding training opportunities for those STEM F1 students may increase their chances of continuing their research work in a US company, and therefore increase the overall chance of a breakthrough in solar. That's why I strongly support the proposal.
