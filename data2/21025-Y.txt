I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. As a technical manager in IT industry. I do need a good engineer. and I don't really care whether they come from. Although it turns out many of them are international students. If I can hire a really excellent American engineer, I will definitely do it. But may time I really find talent from the international student. They are smart and very hard working. And they help contribute much to my project. And as far as I know. there are about 20% engineers are international students. If we cannot hire them. I will be really sad and I will say our company will be impacted a lot by this. So please keep them.
