Joseph McGeary I am completely opposed to extending the period of time (from one year to three years) that foreign workers can remain in jobs under the OPT program. The practical effect of that move will be to keep foreign workers here (in American jobs) at a time when American workers are under-employed or unemployed. It will also depress wages as you increase the number of workers competing for them. Do NOT go through with this proposal!
