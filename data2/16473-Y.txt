For those who oppose the STEM OPT extension, you probably don't realize how much the Americans can LOSE if no foreign student ever wants to come to the U.S. 

The mankind is getting into a new era with all the great advances in robotics, artifical intelligence and molecular biology. All these need more and more smart students in STEM to explore, to make innovations. The STEM students didn't just take the position away from americans they helped to create more by making the industry competitive to foreign companies. Pushing away these smart kids, the America is offering thousands of valuable assets to their foreign competitors, which will in turn harm the America economy and american job opportunities.
