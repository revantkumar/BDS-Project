I must complain about ICEB thinking of expanding or increasing the number of students or training opprotunities for foriegn/nonimmigrants. We have thousands of Americans out of work and you are trying to give businesses incentives to hire nonimmigrants over Americans. We need to hire and support Americans, not foreigners. STOP this practice and support America.
