I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. With the help of international students, technical companies have created significant values, which in turn benefits the US. 

2. Competition is good. It is unnecessary for the citizens to worry about the lost of work opportunities. Companies always prefer native employee if they qualify with the required skills. For those who blamed for this plan and worry about losing the opportunities should think more about how to improve themselves instead of complaining others. 

3. Diversity is an important feature in US. It can enrich the culture and help people be understanding and open.
