As a matter of fact, technology companies are hiring a lot of foreigners because they need them. We all know that these people made great contributions to US for the past hundred years. 

An example is the Civil Engineering department in my school. 80% of the professors are not born in US. They came to US for college, graduate study, and then work at US because of their excellent performance at college. I am pretty sure that the Civil Engineering department would not be among the top in the world without these foreign professors.

Therefore, I strongly agree with this proposal.
