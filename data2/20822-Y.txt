Hi, 

I think this STEM extension is a positive step for all the International students to get education in the United States. These students are well versed with latest technologies. This rule will help the students to apply their skill set and help US economy. The employer's benefit from hiring students that are fresh out of college as they bring fresh perspective and innovative ideas. 

The lack of STEM extension will have a negative impact on the incoming students and it will cause huge losses as the amount of Tuition the international students pay also helps the US economy. United States is a favorable destination not just because they have the best Education system, top universities but also because of the benefits that students get after completing their education. With STEM extension the students get exposure to the industry. 

Also if these students have to go back if the rule doesn't come, all those trained students will have to return to their home country and US economy will be impacted.

I hope this rule goes through. 

Thanks
