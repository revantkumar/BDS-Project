Anonymous Anonymous I support this proposed ruling.

First of all I like the 24 months time for OPT extension. This is a good length for practical training. I have been working in a company designing steam turbine seal for ten months. 
17 months OPT extension might have already set a good foundation for basic engineering technique and operation. Engineering in real world is not only technical but also about doing business and cooperating with people with different aspects of knowledge and resources. 
Through a longer length of OPT extension, I can better contribute to company with my already-built knowledge and experience. Besides I can also take a broader and more in depth look into the company management and the industry, providing more feed back to the company it self and my educational institute.

I also like the idea about e-verifying company for OPT extension. I protect F1 student as well as U.S. employees by asking companies to ensure employees on OPT are commensurate with whose for similarly situated U.S. worker, ensuring the same payment level and equal opportunity.

Besides the Mentoring and Training Plan is also a good point. It emphases the educational aspect of the OPT extension, providing students opportunities to learning from the experiences and equip students to have a more comprehensive understanding of their selected field.

In the end for your request about comment for educational institute participation in OPT extension, I suggest students on OPT extension providing reports back to their educational institute in a period of time. This would help the institute have a better understanding about what students are like after graduation and providing a better educational experience in the future as well as encourage students to think more and get more involved in their settled field.

I support this ruling and especially like the points in the ruling I mentioned above.
