If I understand the regulation or statement I read about the government offering incentives to employers if they would hire foreign students instead of American students. First let me say that foreign students come hear to study knowing full well what it is going to cost and they have already prepared for that or should have.

Our American students have had to pay for their tuition, usually having to out a government loan that they will spend the rest of their life paying off, also, because they have spent most of their money on tuition and have some put away for their living quarters while in college, the American student needs work while they are going to school. I believe that American students have the right to work before foreign students do. If you want to offer incentives offer it for the American student!
