This Travesty must be stopped! Why are Americans being forced out of the job market, with this training for opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with stem degrees and capgap relief for all eligible F-1 when Americans should rec'd help. You are taking away all rights for American citizens with this horrible proposal and sending this country into a major depression. Is this what you want, to hurt as many Americans as possible. I simply cannot believe what is happening, you are taking a great country that so many have died for to trash it. Shame on you!
