Students graduated from STEM, especially engineering majors, need more time to put what they have learned into practice. And from my personal experience, working in a fast-changing area such as computer/software engineering, one-year practice is not enough. We need to give new graduate students time to adapt themselves. Americans have to admit that it's these STEM students who are making huge contributions to ground breaking research and innovations/technology.
