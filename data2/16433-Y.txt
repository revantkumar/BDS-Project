I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The proposal can let the foreign students who study at United State contribute more to the American society. If we get the extension, instead of taking all the knowledge and wonderful experience back to our homeland and help building certain industry in our own country, we can use what we learned in America to serve the American society or help develop certain industry. The extension is not only good for our foreign students, but also benefit to the United State too. Please trust me!

2. The extension will not lead to American people difficult to find or lose their job, in contrast, it will make American society smoother and make ordinary people in American live a better life. The jobs that foreign students get are basically the jobs native American are not willing to do, such as coding. But we like doing that and therefore we can make American society better and better. If we get the extension to stay here longer, we can serve the society more. On the other hand, the traditional "American" industry is still remain Americans', the existence of foreign workers will not influence on that, for example, finance industry is absolutely belong to American. We will make the society smoother, for example, we can develop or code some useful software or application for the finance industry to use, make their lives and work easier, and therefore we contribute to the society. It's WIN-WIN!!
