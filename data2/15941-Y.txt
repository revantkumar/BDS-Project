I am currently a F1 student on OPT status, although I am not from STEM program and would not be a beneficiary of this amendment, I have some important thoughts on the limitations on foreign students working in the U.S like me. 

I have worked and also studied in some other regions/countries around the world, and I would say that U.S has the least favorable environment towards foreign students pursuing job opportunities. Students like me only have one year of work authorization after graduation, which I would say is too short for a college grad to really learn to apply knowledge gained throughout their many years of learning. In the finance industry where I work in, it takes at least two to three years to for us to establish our knowledge base in what we are doing and be fully equipped with the necessary skills to step up a level in the work place. What really happened is that many foreign students like me are sent back to their home country simply because they were not lucky enough to win the H1B lottery after their OPT expired, which cost not only the students dedication and commitment to the work they were doing, destroyed the consistency in their adaptation of skills, but also cost the employer a lot of resources to find replacement and arrange alternative deployment for the employees. The fact that they were only one or two years in the job means that they were't able to leverage the short experience elsewhere. This ultimately would hurt the students career development. 

I would say that giving at least two to three years of work authorization to foreign students would greatly help fulfill their initial objectives of coming to U.S: to really learn knowledge and learn how to apply them in the workplace. Majority of the foreign students I know would eventually go back to their home country after several years of work, and extending OPT allows them to work in this plan without worrying about H1B lottery. Not everyone is anticipating to migrate or live in the U.S f
