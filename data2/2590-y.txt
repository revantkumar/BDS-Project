Richard T As a US citizen, I SUPPORT opt extension. In today's world US companies are competing against other global companies from countries like China, India, Russia, all strong in STEM population. It makes no sense for us to educate their best and brightest only to send them back to compete against us. To those "job protectors", if Amazon loses the battle to Alibaba, or Google loses to Baidu, how many American workers would have to be let go? Just look at our once proud Auto or Shipbuilding industry.
