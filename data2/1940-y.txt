Yitao Yu I strongly support this rule because it is the immigrant friendly culture of the United States that makes it the best country in the world. This rule will attract more talented foreign students to come to United States to pursue further studies and to practice after graduation. Though foreign workers may appear to be competition with native workers, the more talented workers pool will boost the entire economy and create more jobs in the long run.
