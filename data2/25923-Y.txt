I think this policy will benefit not only international students but also Americans for 2 reasons.

1. This policy will give international students more time to practice what they have learnt in school and give back to American society, which is beneficial to the U.S. economy. 

2. Most of international students who come to the U.S. are the ones who love American culture and endorse the American spirits of freedom, equality and hardworking. Giving these people more time to experience these spirits is a good way of spreading American value in the world. 

Thanks.
