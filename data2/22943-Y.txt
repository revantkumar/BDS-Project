I am writing in support of proposed rule change (Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002) to extend the OPT window for eligible F-1 STEM students.

As a STEM graduate student, I have worked with many excellent foreign students. All too often these highly-skilled and motivated students want to stay in the US after graduation but are forced to leave due to visa time limits. These STEM graduates are positioned to be contributing members of their communities and local economies. Extending the OPT limit would help and encourage these students (many of whom have had their educations funded by the US government) remain in the US in high-tech roles.

The proposed rule change is sufficiently targeted to just those who we should really encourage to remain in the US if they desire.
