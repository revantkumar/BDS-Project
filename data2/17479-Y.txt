I strongly support the OPT STEM extension. Those skilled international employees are making significant contribution to US economy. An welcoming environment to talented people is critical for US to keep its advantage all over the world. 

After going through so many negative comments, I found most of these comments are just using misleading wording to make unreasonable arguments. For example, I always saw something like "stop hiring foreigners over qualified Americans". Let's face the fact that those foreigners are even better qualified in order to be hired.
