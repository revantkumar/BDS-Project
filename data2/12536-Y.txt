I'm a student who just graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and currently working at Microsoft on OPT visa. This country has the best and brightest people, innovative companies and it is my honor to be able to work with these smart people, and I am happy to apply my expertise in computer science field to contribute and make a positive impact on people's lives, by innovating in products and providing reliable services. I hope US government could retain skilled IT talents, open doors for scientist and engineers like myself, because this will in the long term benefit the eco-system, boost economy and keep this country at the forefront of technology and innovation, and this is why America is prosperous. Thank you sincerely. -Robin
