Yuening Zhang For those international students that work hard and get a job offer from their employers, it is not fair to force them out of the country and lose the job simply because they are not a citizen. They pay the high tuition (which is what the universities want) with an expectation for a job offer. And if they are well qualified for the job, it is beneficial both on the company and the student's side, and the students actually contribute a lot to America's economy. It is actually beneficial to United States on the whole because then United States can attract more talented students to come in this way. All in all, it should largely depends on the individual's capability. If you believe the United States of America grants everyone the equal right and equal chance, there is no reason to force the students out of America, especially when international students are already facing a barrier of visa sponsorship and limited period of OPT.

I am really uncomfortable about some people saying that international students 'steal' away jobs from them. They are not stealing. They earn it by hard work. It is not going to work well if every American thinks that he or she just owns everything simply because he or she is a citizen of America.
