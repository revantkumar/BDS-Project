I strongly support the OPT extension program. 
According to my experience in Red Hat inc, development of software takes a rather long time to complete. The extension will definitely help our tech company ensure the integrity and continuity of projects. International students are the key element to the development of high-tech industry. Only if we hire students from all over the world, the innovative ideas can gather here in United States. This will surely benefit the economy and create more jobs for American citizens in long term.
