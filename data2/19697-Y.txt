This rule is good for the American Education system, the US economy and the society.

From the Institute of International Education in partnership with the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.

For 2013-2014, Total international student enrollment: 886,052

What these students will bring to the American Education System include but are not limited to, (1)more than billions of dollars of tuition, (2)more than billions of money spent locally that will help local business grow, (3)diversity and more.

The tuition collected will help American Education System to grow, improve and provide better education for the Americans. The money that the students spent during their studies in the US will help local business grow. The related tax will help support the Federation, the states and the local counties.

If the OPT Extension was not improved and expanded, students will be intimidated to come to the US. If there is not a good training system to strength the education experience of international student, why would they pay such huge amount money? This is evident from the many comments submitted to this proposed rule as well as from other sources.
