Shyam Ramaseshan STEP OPT extension is an important part of a F1 student's status in the United States. Removing the extension will affect hundreds of thousands of students currently enrolled in STEM courses in US universities. The extension also gives the students a fair chance to compete for H1B visas while compared to petitioners from other countries. Without the extension, many students and companies currently having students employed in OPT will be negatively impacted. I strongly recommend this extension.
