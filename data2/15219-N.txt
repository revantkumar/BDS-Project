what is wrong with giving our own citizens the training and job opportunitys that this government gives to immigrants and foreign workers!we already have a vast pool of qualified and motivated workers from which to choose from in this country!we are getting way too many immigrants into our country that is now and eventually going to create many social,cultural,and overpopulation problems that our children will have to deal with!the american dream is a right given to our american children by birthrite-not to be given by out of touch and short-sighted government employees attempting to promote thier own personal/political party affiliation!
