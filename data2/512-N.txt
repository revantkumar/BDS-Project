I thought the Dems were on the side of the workers but this is not true anymore. If they can not contain themselves to allow a flood of foreign workers I am down with them. The Optional Practical Training program takes jobs away from our students, gives business more opportunity to keep wages low, and creates more stagnant unemployment of our own people. We can not continue to take the best and brightness from other countries because they NEED them, and we do not! 
Try to curtail the flood of foreign workers and start helping us.
