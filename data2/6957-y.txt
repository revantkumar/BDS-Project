Zilong Deng As a STEM graduate student, I am now working in my major area (Statistics) very closely. I know the condition of this field.Extend OPT for STEM students will never have any negative impact to American students. 

First, very few US students study Statistics at school, especially at graduate level. In my class, nearly 90% students are foreigners. Therefore, when these students graduate form school, they will find jobs in their major areas which few Americans are in. 

Second, statisticians are largely needed by US labor market. More and more companies are building their own statistical analysis team to contribute for their business. However, most of the statistic graduates in US are foreigners, if these students cannot work in US legally, how could these companies hire people they needed? 

To conclusion, STEM students working in US will contribute to its economic and strength of every area. They will never reduce the working opportunities of US students. It's a correct and reasonable choice to approve the OPT Extension to 24 months or even longer.
