Wen Zhu As a researcher, I know that one year is a very short time for a project. Without the extension of OPT, there will be huge loss in the perspective of research and also a great waste for the time and money spent during the only year of OPT if the project need to be suspended due to the OPT or visa problem.

This will be a lose-lose case if cancelling the extension of OPT. On the opposite, I think the extension should be longer, 5 years is better. This will solve the problems for a big amount of companies who cannot afford the sponsorship for work visa.
