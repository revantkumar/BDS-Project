Edwin Tambi This proposed OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months is a really great idea. It will benefit all the parties involved. Firstly, it gives room for F-1 students to get adequate practical training and also transforming the knowledge gain from the classroom into brilliant productive innovations in the STEM fields.
Secondly, the companies and organizations that hire F-1 students due to the 24 months will now have adequate time to benefit from the skills of these F-1 students. Also, the employers in a long term view will be able to to retain the F-1 students for the extension period rather than the continually hiring of the needed skills.
This proposed rule is a really good idea and should be establish.
