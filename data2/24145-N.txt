I would like to register my voice against DHS's amendment to F-1 non-immigrant student visa regulations.

Our country is already hurting with so many unemployed who have gone in debt in STEM programs. This expansion can only further harm families and the US economy. As Ian Smith of the Immigration Reform Law Institute has pointed out "because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program."

Not only does this hurt American families and the US economy, but it also diminishes the revenues that could be used to fund existing government function.

I would like to hear back on my comment also, please.
