The OPT does bring the benefit to both foreign students and high teach-companies. However, it also brings tremdous benefit to the development in the industres in America and helps America to keep it position in technology. 

Currently, all foreign students are already required to show that they are more capable than any potential domestic students to win a job permission. Thus, I don't believe there is any threat to the US citizens' employment. 

The only question left is then. For a well-educated student originated from overseas, should they be kicked out and worked for companies in other countries just because their origins?
