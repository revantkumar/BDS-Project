As an international law student who also majored in Economics and Art History strongly disagrees with this extension. It is extremely unfair and unnecessary to extend the OPT for STEM Degrees. First of all, a promising person does not need 24 months to prove his/her ability to earn the position. Second, or other majors do not necessarily produce less value to the society. As I know, many of my fellows devote way more time and effort in contributing to the society than STEM students. It is obvious that this policy will attract a lot unqualified international students to this field. In addition, I believe every major deserves a same shot because the value that we give back to the society is not limited by the majors. Last but not least, need for cheap labor in the technology field is not the best reason to extend the OPT because the U.S. has more than that. Do you really need to use the cheap shot to attract cheap labors?
