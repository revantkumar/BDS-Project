Beibe Jiang I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am a international PhD student in Materials Science from China. The reason I chose United States for my PhD degree is because I can get the best professional training in STEM here during school and after graduation. Without OPT support and extension, many Chinese students like me will prefer other countries and areas where international students have more opportunities after graduation. As we know, international students play a very important role in STEM field not only in academic research but also in industrial innovation. Their good qualities such as hard-working, innovative and friendly make them indispensable in a teamwork. So it will be a big loss for the development of United States in the field of scientific research. Also, it will definitely becomes a huge disaster for most high-tech companies.
