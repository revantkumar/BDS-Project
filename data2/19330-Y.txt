This proposal definitely should be supported. I believe this proposal is absolutely beneficial both for the U.S. and the students. Since it's just an extension for STEM nonimmigrant students, in the long run it will not pose problems for the U.S. citizens. Instead, it will provide a large amount of work force for the U.S., which is definitely critical to boost the U.S. economy. Besides, with more opportunity, more talented students will be attracted to the U.S., helping to improve all aspects including technology, culture and economy.
STEM graduates, whether American or international student, you can find well-paid work. As a whole, this shows that the STEM program DOES NOT prevent American citizens finding STEM field job. The requirement amount of STEM fields talent gap is multimillion level. We need STEM international students to fill this huge gap!!!
