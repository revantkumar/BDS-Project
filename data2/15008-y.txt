Elizabeth Blose Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. Expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
