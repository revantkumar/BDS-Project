I strongly disagree with the Department of Homeland Security's proposal to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 Students.

It is an outrage as to how American workers are being denied jobs not only through illegal immigration, but also by the way foreign students are given more and more opportunities to come into this country and steal jobs from Americans. This proposal is just one more example of this government's effort to enlarge that number of non-immigrants.

OPT has already denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the period of 20009-2013. My son is one of those who could not get a job during that time period due to the heavy influx of foreign students. We spent all of that money on his education, then upon graduation, he couldn't find a job.

Not only did it impact him because he couldn't find a job, but it impacted my wife and I, who are on a fixed income, because we had to support him during that horrific time.

OPT has also taken more than 4 billion dollars from Social Security and the Medicare trust funds, and that also has a bearing on us because it drains those funds and makes our costs increase.

Please reconsider this action, because it is detrimental to American families.

Thank you.
