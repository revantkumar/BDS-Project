I strongly support this rule. Foreign Students with STEM Degrees 

1. Are very hard working, has highest degrees in their field of studies, Contribute to ground breaking researches and highly Innovative.

2. It is a fact that foreign born immigrants has the highest chance of establishing a business here in the United States and employ more people if given an opportunity.

3. Logically, We want to help growing America GDP by keeping the highly skilled technical people in this country. If These highly skilled students trained my state of the art American universities didn't get a chance to stay in this country, They will go to other countries, create businesses in other countries or join top companies. This clearly poses a threat to American companies and may further diminish this country economy. 

4. These people are in PRIME earning stage, pay taxes, and help grow the country economy. This is the only way to keep the USA as a factory of innovation and attract highly skilled students.

5. If opportunities for students are not available In USA, Students will not come to USA. This effects a large economic impact on US universities and thus impacts their research activities.
