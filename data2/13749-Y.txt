I strongly support this proposed rule for extra OPT extension so that US can attract more international students to better grow the economy and education. We know that international students need to pay more tuition and fees than US citizens. This can bring huge income to all the universities that take international students, which will benefit university's education resource. Besides the tuition fee, the domestic demand have been expanded and consumptions have been stimulated because of international students here, which can be converted to tax and benefit each US citizens. Passing the proposed rule indicate the friendly attitude of US on international students so that more international students are willing to come to US for study, leading to more tuition for university and tax for US government.
