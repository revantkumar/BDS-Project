I strongly oppose this extension of OPT. It creates an incentive for companies to hire a foreign worker over an American worker since they can avoid payroll taxes this way and puts downward pressure on wages in the tech industry. Many Americans can't get work. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
