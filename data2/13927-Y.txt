I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule. 

(1) The government should let the students who acquired knowledge from US universities serve the country with their expertise. 

(2) In addition to technical contribution, international students with STEM background also help to boost the dynamics, diversity and competence of US companies, which are increasingly important within the framework of globalization. 

(3) Open mind and equality are the most attractive features of US culture. Limiting career opportunities to people with specific background (i.e., citizen) goes against those spirits.
