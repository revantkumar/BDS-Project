Appreciate US Government's efforts to extend STEM OPT for 24 months. Please continue OPT STEM Extension.

Please make sure F-1 students don't work illegally in restaurants, motels, gas stations or similar services which is not allowed on F-1 visa.

Also, please scrutinize all consultancy firms in US which keep chasing F-1 students to use them as a cheap labor during their OPT / OPT STEM period, show fake experiences for job perspective and doom them when it comes to H1B visa petition. I have noticed few students becoming victims of such consultancies. I hope same as OPT STEM Extension , US government will take care of this issue too.

Thank you!
