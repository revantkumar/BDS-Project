As a retired CBP officer I have seen the mass influx of these students and now the government wants more. At what point does our leaders start supporting Americans and not seeing how many freebies they can give to big business in the form of less money paid to foreign workers. We lose on Social security taxes and the companies get richer. Our kids (i have three competing for jobs) and can't obtain them because their are not foreign workers. How long before our government decides to give back to the American people.
