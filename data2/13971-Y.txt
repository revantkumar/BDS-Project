The reason why international students come to US paying 20k-50k dollar per year is b/c the high quality education and lots of opportunities to do coop/internship/research projects. Increasing OPT will help them master the skills they learned from classroom. That will enhance their competency when they go back to home countries. Without OPT, I think the graduate programs will not be so attractive for international students to just sit in the classroom copying professor notes without even practicing what they learned. That is lose-lose situation for both US education/economy and international students.
