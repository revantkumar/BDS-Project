I strong suggest that OPT should have an extension of 24 month. Reason as follows:

1.The STEM major students have high standard science and math skills that the US job market need to maintain and develop the high intelligent industry, keeping its No.1 place in the world.

2.The majority of STEM students rank among the best elites in the world, US will think it is a much better choice to keep them here to develop US rather than send all of them back to their own country to bring the cutting edge skills to other countries.

3.As for STEM students, an extension of 24 month will give them more chances to get H1B lottery to be legal to live and work in US.
