I strongly support this proposed rule.

- Having a longer OPT enable international students to get working experiences. Some of these students may play important roles in uplifting the current economy of the country. They can fill in some much needed job vacancies left open by domestic applicants, and eventually create even more jobs through their highly valuable specialization in the STEM fields.

- Having a longer OPT allows international students to carry their positive influence in academic setting further into the professional setting. We all know how much american colleges benefit from having a diverse group of student. An integral part of this is due to the fact that many international student have particularly strong background in the STEM fields, benefiting their peers through learning and doing things together on a daily basis. 

- Having a longer OPT can reduce the stress and frustration that international students experience months before the actual deadline. This rule would have a huge impact on campus life in american colleges considering tragedies sprouted from international students getting too frustrated from issues concerning their immigration status.
