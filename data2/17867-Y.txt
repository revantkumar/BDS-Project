I support this rule because it is good for all Americans in long term. US would be a second rate country if she refused the best brains in the world. The people who don't have skills and enough aspirations to work should know the employers won't hire them just because they have American citizenship, the enterprises will transfer their business to Europe or Asia, the American workers will have to move to abroad or lose their jobs. Then US will lose both the best enterprises and the best employees in some years. Why America become America? Because she absorbs the best of world. The day she begin to close the door to the world, is the day she begin to decline.
