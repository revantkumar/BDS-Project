Kevin Wan, Microsoft Improving and expanding OPT for STEM students is obviously good for US people and US economy. 

1. I my city (Seattle), one foreign worker creates 9 local jobs in service sector including restaurant, medicare, transportation, education, sales, retail etc. Foreign students under OPT are usually single and young, so they often contribute more than average foreign workers. 

2. In STEM area, it is a well known fact that there is no enough US graduates to fill in the job positions. I have never seen or heard a US citizen who successfully earned a degree is not able to find a better position in job market than average foreigners. "Martin Spinella"s need to stop fabricating false fact to blame people who cannot vote for things they screw up themselves. 

3. Diversity and foreign talent of US offices have been the cutting edge for us businesses. All nations have talents, but only US has the advantage of importing a large number of foreign workers. Von Neumann, Cate Blanchett, Brin Sergey, Jerry Yang were all foreign born. Marquis de Lafayette was foreign born.
