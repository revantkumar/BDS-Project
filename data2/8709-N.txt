I think this proposal is another slap in the face to natural born citizens!! OPT has denied US workers more than 430,000 jobs just in the years 2009-2013 already! Removing $4 billiion from Social Security and Medicare trust funds for people who have NEVER paid in to those systems is robbery, plain and simple. The American worker has paid into those systems during a life time of working in good faith that those funds would be appropriated to AMERICANS who need help in their retirement. That is AFTER devoting their lives to jobs that keep this country going, not foreigners who have devoted NOTHING to this country but are only here to TAKE. I am a 57 year old displaced worker who is having a hard time finding a job that offers me insurance benefits. I have worked all my life yet when you reach a certain age it becomes difficult to get a good job. Relying on social security to be there when I turn 65 is no longer an option because of this sort of dipping into the funds for foreigners! 
My daughter has tons of government loans accumulated so she could achieve the degree she has teaching special education. It will be decades before her debt is paid YET if she were born in another country she could have gone for free?? That CANNOT be the American way!! We have the greatest threat of security breaches now then at any other time in my lifetime yet we are allowing foreign students to come into this country for extended periods, losing track of where they are and giving them a FREE education. Seriously?! There has to be SOMEONE in this world who still has some patriotism and common sense to see that this goes against EVERY thing America stands for! If we don't take care of our own.......who will?? Definitely NOT all those foreign countries who are seeing the riches of this atrocity!! This has GOT TO STOP!!!!
