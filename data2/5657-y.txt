Yilan Zhan Extend the F-1 OPT is definitely a win-win game for both United States and International students:

First of all, US government has been encouraging bringing in high-educationist intellectuals into US to improve economy. OPT extension allows international students in high technology fields to stay longer. So that they are more likely to stay and creating more wealth for this country. Although it also means social security will be taking care of more people, but remember, high technology employees are paying more tax.

Secondly, US has devoted a large amount of scholarship to international students to encourage and support their high-educations. The scholarship money will be totally wasted if we kick them back right after they finishing their programs. We should use the money to attract the world's genius to work for us, to make our country powerful, not to educate them and then send them back to support our rivals.
