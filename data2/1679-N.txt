Can we not make jobs FIRST for the citizens of this country that are out of work or in minimal (below cost of living) jobs? That should be a number one priority. Please use our country's money in the same way you use your own budget....or maybe you do? Well, one way or the other, you all need to cut back; don't spend every last cent because it is in the budge, let it roll over to next year.
