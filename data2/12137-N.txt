I strongly oppose expanding the length of time for the F-1 nonimmigrant students. The tech companies are allowed to pay
lower wages to these students. It undercuts job opportunities for American workers. No reason why they're exempt from
paying taxes on their earnings. We certainly shouldn't be supporting them for their entire time here studying. I feel this type
of program may be a ploy of the Obama Administration in thus allowing them to stay permanently and get green cards. Why
can't people understand the more immigrants that we allow in this country, the less number of jobs there are for Americans?
We want Americans to be helped first before immigrants. The Obama Administration spends most of their time trying to figure
out how to stick it to the American workers, make our country weak and skirt around the rules of law and Congress. It's 
corrupt and this proposal leads right into that narrative.
