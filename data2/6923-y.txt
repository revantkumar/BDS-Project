Gracie Downs, DAV STOP THE OVERREACH. WE NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR STUDENTS AND FUTURE WORKERS. IF WE ALLOW STUDENTS TO COME INTO OUR COUNTRY IN DROVES, STUDY THEN STAY HERE, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF WORKERS. WHERE ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH CAN WE AS AMERICANS GO AND DO THAT? WOULD ANY OTHER NATION ALLOW US TO INFRINGE ON THEIR CULTURE, FUTURE AND STANDARD OF LIVING IN THIS MANNER? I DO NOT THINK SO. SO LET US STOP THIS POLICY RIGHT HERE AND NOW. IT IS ABOUT SELF PRESERVATION.
