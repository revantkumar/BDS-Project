When I signed the contract with my contract, we both expect to have at least two years of employment together. The change of the law does not only sabotage my plan of life but also cause problems for my employer. I believe the same problems happen to a lot more employees on STEM OPT.
If the OPT extension is to be canceled, it shouldn't happen to the people who already started their OPT. Just to be fair, individual working contract is signed and further sponsor is agreed upon that the employment will be at least 24 months long, and it should not be violated by the change of regulation that happened "after" we started our OPT.
