Barbara Vonk I support the idea of OPT STEM expansion from 17 to 24 months.
Because,
(1)Well educated and highly trained foreign workers are expensive for hiring in US. But, OPT students are comparatively cheaper though they are well trained and they are more flexible (as they are already been in US from last 2 years), help US companies to quickly respond to changing Demands.
Hence longer the OPT period, more the benefits to US.
(2)Students got benefit in getting Higher Education and Technical skills from US Universities. Now, it is the US turn to utilize their learned skills for the benefit of US Economy.
(3)Instead of bringing people from other countries on H1 where the purpose is to replace the requirement US lacks, increasing OPT to 24 months and absorbing these students and make them in favor of our requirement in this period.
For this F1 Visa issuing process should get tightened. (Filtering should be done accurately at Embassy level)
(4)Students who finished their Masters here in US already learned our culture. Retaining those Students who interested in our culture is always good sign to our country. (After they knew our History)
(5)If these STEM students stay for more period, we can collect taxes which boosts our economy.
