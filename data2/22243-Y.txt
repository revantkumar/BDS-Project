I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Students who get education in US should have the same right to make their contribution to this country. The nationality should not be taken into consideration.

2. Diversity is very important for a great country. How can the government forbid foreign students do there contribution.

3. Foreign students do not make a vicious competition. They do not ask for low salary. What they get is according to recruiters' serious consideration.
