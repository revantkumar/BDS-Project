Stephanie Li I strongly agree the proposal of 24 month OPT rule. 

First of all, the US economy is heavily depends on many industries that hire STEM major graduates and there are not sufficient US citizen who studies STEM degree in the country. Many international students are very talented and study in the STEM field. These students in generally have great performance in their fields and they are also the top performers from their countries. They can create lots of economic benefits for the US.

Some US citizen is arguing against it since they think international students can compete with local citizens for jobs. This worry is very unnecessary because it was found that a STEM graduate can create more job openings. 

Therefore, I strongly support the OPT rule and hope the USCIS can pass it very soon.
