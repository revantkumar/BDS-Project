These are exactly the types of people we want to be in our county; highly educated, highly motivated to work, and eager to make companies and themselves better. These are not people who will be on assistance or a detriment to society now or further into the future. We should be encouraging these people to become citizens to stay here and become part of the work force. They are willing and wanting to work at a high level, that's more than some who are U.S. Citizens. If we don't encourage them to stay, then they will take their American education back to their home country and enter that work force to compete against the U.S. So basically we are producing better competition abroad, hurting ourselves. Encourage them to stay and work and pay taxes and contribute, that's what they want to do! American workers are hurt more if they go back to their home country and work there.
