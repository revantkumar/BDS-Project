Harkirat Singh I am in favor of 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule. I Love contributing to Innovation and American economy.
This rule attracts the competitive pool of STEM workers across the globe, which strengthens the educational system of United States. Because of the rule, highly talented international students will start applying for universities in United States. This will increase the university earning. The more is the university funding, better will be the investment in educational programs going forward (like scholarship, new R&D departments, latest labs, just to name a few). Hence the standard of education will increase.
Also, its a fallacy that "highly skilled international students reduce american employment". If we analyse the fact carefully, this actually increases the employment opportunity in US. More the talented pool of students, better off will be the companies' (hiring STEM students) profit. This increases the efficiency, quality of service and revenue in respective field. More revenue and profit creates more job opportunities.
