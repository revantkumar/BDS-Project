Luyao Huang I strongly agreed that the STEM-OPT extension proposal, and I'm here to refute some of the negative opinion.

1. Somebody said "Please stop supporting foreigners over their own citizens". Then, let me ask you a question, why those high tech company would like to hire foreigners instead of citizens since foreigners cost more? Because most of your US citizens don't like science, engineering or math jobs. If they don't hire foreigners, their business can't run well, no new techs could be created, economy could go down, that's much worse for the whole US society and country. That's why the extension is only for STEM students, not for everyone.

2. Someone said "this extension will help more people to do illegal immigration", I can't see why. If you don't give this extension, someone with strong willing to stay in the US will try to be illegal immigration after the only 12 months if they can't get the H1B. The OPT-extension will no doubt help preventing this phenomenon.

3. Several research show that the whole country is still lacking of STEM labors like engineer and scientist. And you can notice that the salary is still growing, positions are still opening, it is not only opened for international students but also to US citizens.
