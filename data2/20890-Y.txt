Strongly support 24 month extension. 

International students pay much more tuition than regular american students. These money go directly into schools, governments and those welfare programs that support people who refuse to find a job. 

This extension program might take a little money away from those welfare programs. However, international students fund those programs in the first place!!!!!

This program definitely attracts more international students (to pay for super expensive tuition).
