Uma Mahesh Raghavaraju I would strongly support for improving and expanding the training and also the opportunity for the international students and personally me, its my dream to study and work here in USA as it is a land with all kind of mindset people and here the communication is much more important and it thought me how to do manage the time, how to be independent and many more important things in my life. I would sincerely request to please help the international students and approve the OPT extension rule and it would be a reason and meaning in my life and many other skilled students. If we got a chance, we will prove and work hard for the people and also for the nation. And I want to say once again its my dream and I personally like myself than before because this place made me to be strong in skills and communicate fluently which is very important for each and every human being on the earth.

Thanks and Regards,
R. Mahesh.
