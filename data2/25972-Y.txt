Check out how many international students studying stem majors, that is a really big part of the people doing research and technology stuff. With the stem extension, they can serve well in US rather than bring that knowledge back to their country, that is why America is pretty strong. Also check out how many scientific research were conducted by international stem students, this policy is good for US economy and education, more and more international students come to US for better opportunities and environment. The technology competition makes its advances, the government should not just kick these guys out for more jobs, that is not sustainable, China and India will be happy because they got technological human resources trained by the US, they paid nothing but the US paid the education resources. The US should try to keep higher educated guys to maintain leading in the world, if these guys can not get even a chance here, no guys will come here for higher education, this will make the US a new North Korea in the future because they refuse everything.
