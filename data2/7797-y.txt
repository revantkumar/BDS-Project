Candice Yu I would highly support the extension of STEM OPT, for the reasons as follow:

1. Most international graduates in STEM majors will work for high-tech companies, which is the primary driving force of U.S. economic development. Skilled immigrants have made out-sized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helped grow create jobs for all Americans. At the same time, OPT employees will also contribute to a fairly large amount of taxes.

2. Many employers spend a lot of time and money on new employee training, especially for the positions that require technical skills. If the OPT period is short, employers and their productivity will suffer from the losses of time, money, and talents.

3. U.S. has the spirit and history of welcoming immigrants to enhance the nations diversity, culture, and economy. It is also one of the most important factors that U.S. attract talents all over the world. The extension of STEM OPT will also help universities to attract more talented international students studying in U.S.
