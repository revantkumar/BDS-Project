I support the rule about OPT extension. My reasons are listed below:

1. OPT extension doesn't mean permit for immigration. We foreign students travels thousands of miles from our countries to US to learn more advanced knowledge from universities, and most of us want to go back to motherlands after a couple of years' experience.

2. Most foreign students are of high qualification since we need to pass a lot of strict examinations and assessments to get the acceptance from US universities. To express our gratitude to these opportunities of advanced education, foreign students would like to service US with what they learn for a few years. At the same time, they can also learn more experience from the US industry, which will help them better contribute their motherlands after going back.

3. It is advocated in American spirit that everyone deserves equal chance. Foreign people don't mean to occupy American people's jobs. Instead, skilled and talented foreign people will help with the improvement of the economy in US, and as well increase the diversity in the work market. American people will still have their jobs if they are working hard and qualified for their work.

4. OPT extension will also attract more good foreign students to study in US, which will improve the US education system.
