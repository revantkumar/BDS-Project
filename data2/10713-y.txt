S Frost The Department of Homeland Security is proposing a new rule to expand the Optional Practical Trainng. This would incentivize companies to hire foreign workers over Americans for tech jobs. The main reason being is that these companies would not have to pay their portion of employer taxes for the foreign workers. I don't understand why the government would put foreign workers over a natural born citizen. Shouldn't our interests be protected? The passing of this would only serve to the detriment of American workers and new graduates. Not to mention that these employers would also not have to pay the prevailing wage. There are way too many Americans out of work as it is. Please stop this before it gets started.
