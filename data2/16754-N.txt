This legislation would be a travesty to all the hard working college students hoping to find a job upon graduation. It gives an unfair cost advantage to the foreign students, through the presumably lower wages and employer paid taxes, on their wages. Rather than give further incentives to corporate friends in the tech industry, instead lets focus our attentions on helping American citizen college graduates as they enter the workforce.
It is a farce that there are not enough qualified American citizens available to do the jobs. Just check out the REAL under and unemployment numbers, then be guided accordingly.
