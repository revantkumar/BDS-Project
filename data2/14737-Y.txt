I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:
1. It is the empolyers who make the final decision to choose the right person. If international students are competitive enough, they should be hired. 
2. Paid the higher tuition of universities than the domestic students, international students deserve the OPT proposal to increase the possibility to find a job in US, because 
finding a job is the aim for most of international students.
