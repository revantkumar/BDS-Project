I believe that Opt extension will HELP REVITALIZE THE ECONOMY OF AMERICA. Many great leaders in America like Elon Musk, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Madeleine Korbel Albright. They are not born in America, but they make this country a better place through their consistent contribution for this country in various fields.

Opportunities should be given those people who have great capability and future dreams. These young students will definitely contribute a lot for America.
