Expanding stem and F1 student visas is not only a Bad Idea, it is a Killer of Jobs for the American people and America Economy. 
Just look at what Disney World did in Replacing it's IT workers with Ones from India
under H1B. To make it worse they the America workers were made to trane there Replacements. 
So inturn if this continues our own government will destroy the entire stem industry for the American Citizens. It is the Governmens Job to Protect the American people. Not to Protect the American Corporations from the people of this Great Nation.
