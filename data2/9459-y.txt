Michael Bruning Our own government data and private statistics confirm that over 74% of STEM graduates are currently unemployed, under employed, or working in other professions.

This says a lot about how our elected officials are playing "favorites" with foreign nationals - over American citizens. By allowing special consideration for foreign national students who graduate with a degree with a STEM degree, our own government is denying its own citizens and equal opportunity to achieve the American Dream and to further their career in a field which provides more and more challenges and personal prosperity.

If anything, the government needs to set the example by insisting that company's hire qualified American worker's first. Instead, we sit and watch Disney, Apple, Microsoft, Face Book, Google and many other IT firms hire foreign nationals and in most every instance, require American IT employee's to Train the foreign Nationals before they get pushed out the door. this is adding insult to injury, because the Foreign Nationals are trained by the American IT's to do the same job they were doing at less pay. to say the very least, this isn't a skills or qualification based decision....this is purely chasing the money for higher profits and personal wealth of the company owners.
