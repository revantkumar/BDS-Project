I STRONGLY support the new regulation for the following reasons:

1) This is a very good proposal which attracts those brightest students from all over the world to study here and also do some contributions to U.S. without worrying about the immigration status as soon as their graduate. This will play an important role to the development in the fields of technology, industry and economy of U.S..

2) One year is also not enough for those people who have involved into the work. Like our company, the shortest item still have to cost three years from the beginning to the end. So this proposal is also very important for the companies who employ those international students.
