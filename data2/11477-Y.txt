I strongly support the rules of expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.

First of all, America put a lot of efforts in educating STEM students, who should service America after they get the degree. Secondly, STEM students work in areas that most industries have great shortage in, such as technology, engineering etc. Giving the STEM students more opportunities to work will not affect US workers at all but only benefit the American industries and contributes to the growth of US economy.
