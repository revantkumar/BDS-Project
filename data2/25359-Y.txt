I Strongly SUPPORT this proposal for these reasons as follows. First of all, students resource is an important part of United States's development. If we short-sightedly against this proposal, we will loss a large amount of intellect.
Secondly, as far as I concerned, the foreign students I have met are typically working and studying very hard, no matter in class or doing part-time job in campus. So just like I said before, if we do not support this proposal, we will lose these industrious and useful young students. They maybe go back or go to other countries and work for them.
Last, I wanna mention is, United States per se, is an immigrant country. It flourished from last century is because U.S assimilated lots of excellent intellect from foreign after WWII. And this century is highly depend on STEM related technology. This proposal is just support STEM students working for the U.S. So against or forbid this proposal can be count as a extremely shortsighted and baneful action.
