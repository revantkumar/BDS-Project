I strongly support the proposed rule by the DHS because 1. International talents have been the major driver for innovations in the Unites States in the past hundred years. Just to name a few Albert Einstein, the 2010 Chemistry Nobel Prize winner Ei-ichi Negishi, and the 2015 Nobel Prize Winner in Physiology and Medicine Youyou Tu. There are so many more influencers and contributors to this country who are international talents. 2. By extending the training period after graduation, it will attract more attention to the top-tier talents from the globe which will boost the U.S. innovation capability as well as the economy. 3. Having a longer training period will give the local companies, especially high-tech companies, a peace of mind because it provides them the flexibility of training and developing the international talents without worrying about them leaving only after 12 months. 4. Now, more and more American companies are expanding globally. Therefore, these companies need to have a diverse talent pool to stay competitive to penetrate the global market. The extension allows them to enlarge their talent pool without having too much hassle. In other words, it can actually help them expand globally. By doing so, more jobs will be created for both Americans and foreigners, the unemployment rate will drop, and the economy will be stimulated.
