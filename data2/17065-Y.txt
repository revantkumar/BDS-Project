It cannot be more obvious that Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities will be beneficial to U.S. economy. If we expect our economy to be as prosperous as it is in 90s, our companies has to go out of our country, and those well educated international students will give our companies different views. 

How is it possible for a U.S. company to succeed in new rising markets without any employees in those country? It is ridiculous to say those international students take job opportunities from our own people. The fact is that international students can help our companies succeed in new rising markets and create much more jobs in America.

The sooner we improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees, the more we will benefit from them.
