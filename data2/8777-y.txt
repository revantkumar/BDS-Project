james bews Don't approve this. American STEM graduates are having difficulty finding STEM jobs. This after completing challenging degree programs and incurring huge debt. Why would you give away jobs to foreigners that Americans need?
I find this program as well as the H1-B program to be completely unneeded and extremely damaging to the country and the economy.
