Ni Zhang I strongly recommend the two years extension for the OPT, here are the reasons why I support this. 
I saw some people state that the OPT extension "steal" lots of stem jobs from American born workers, but as I can see, I am a software engineer in the automotive industry. I can see that the company is much much more eager to hire the american native people, if they do not have the suitable choice, and then they will hire international fresh graduates. Clearly I can see that only the american native STEM workers cannot fulfill the needs for the automotive development. So we need the international stem talents to make contributions to the USA. 
Next, I saw some people see that the some companies offer much much lower wages to the STEM international workers,as far as I can see, most of my classmates are friends are work in the automotive industry after graduation, and the average salary of them is more than 60,000 dollars per year, and this is in Michigan. For me, my first offer give me 65,000 per year, and I pay more than 1,000 dollars tax per month. Clearly see that we do a great contributions to this country. We use our knowledge to make the USA a better place to live. 
I just want to emphasize that we are not "stealing" jobs from the native american people, if a native American person can work hard and study hard for the STEM subjects, it is much much more easier for them to find the suitable jobs. the companies are more eager to hire native people for sure, Forget about the rumor. Some people making tales that the the hardworking american STEM workers cannot find the jobs. THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!! 
The only reason that a STEM worker cannot find a job is because he/she is not hardworking at all!!!!
Again, I hope that the two year extension can be passed and it will definitely help the US to become a better country. 
The history told us that the America needs the international talents to do their contributions.
