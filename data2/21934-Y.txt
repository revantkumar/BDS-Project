I am a international student, who just got an offer in my major, electrical engineering. What I want is learning practical skills here for a while, then I will return to my country and found my own startup. My country is developing so rapidly, and has a huge potential market for smart hardware, compared with USA, I think I can become more successful in my own country. On the other side, electrical companies here, especially startups, they do need more talents to help them do basic engineering, with cheap salary. International students are the best talents from our own countries, that can offer excellent work without high payroll. While the companies need to pay much more to hire a citizen with the same skills. It is good for American's technology industry, as well as for international students ourselves. We really should support it.

Again, I love my country, my country is developing and I want to make my contribution. I don't need youro greencard or citizenship here, but please give chance to polish and prove my ability so I can have better career when I return home, as well as make contribution to your economy.
