Good Day, and thank you for your consideration on this proposed change. I would like to express my concern that despite the best of intentions, this extension/ expansion of the OPT program will be to the detriment of US STEM students and professionals. I am in Orlando and, while it pertains more to the H1-B program, I have heard of the shameful action by Disney to have some of their tech employees train their foreign replacements prior to their own termination. This abuse by Disney should exclude their eligibility from future H1-B participation and result in some sort of punitive action or fine. I feel that this is exactly the type of result that the OPT extension would foster in participating companies. We need to let US employers hire citizens first instead of a defacto "hiring" of foreign students. OPT was designed to help train foreign students and increase their chances of employment when they return home. Now they will be in more direct competition with US citizens. There are many here that are unemployed and should have priority for domestic jobs. Another aspect is the incentive to "train" these workers by eliminating billions in FICA and Medicare payments. This is not something that should be happening to our tax base at this time.

Sincerely, 
Wayne Slaymaker
