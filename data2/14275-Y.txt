I am completely and totally against this proposed rule: "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students."
First, I would like to know why we have ANY training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees?
Second, Why don't we spent the money this program is costing the American Taxpayer to providing scholarships to students who are U.S. Citizens?
Third, will allow the subsidizing of foreign students in obtaining advanced degrees who work here for a few years after graduation, then return to their home countries. This practice leaves us with a lower number of U.S. Citizens who have graduated with advanced STEM degrees. In other words, this practice makes our country more dependent on foreign students filling highly technical positions in some of the most sensitive and classified programs that are ongoing at the present and future times.
DO NOT APPROVE THIS RULE, AND CANCEL THE EXISTING RULE.

Thank you,
Bob Walters
