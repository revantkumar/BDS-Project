NO TO THIS "PROPOSAL"

AMERICANS FIRST AND LAST IN AMERICA.

WHY IS DHS PROPOSING TO GIVE FOREIGNERS JOBS IN AMERICA?

WE HAVE AMPLE COLLEGE STUDENTS TO FILL THESE JOB POSITIONS. WHY TURN OUR BACKS ON US?

"WE THE PEOPLE" want "WE THE PEOPLE" to have the jobs.

WHY IS THIS ADMINISTRATION ALWAYS TRYING TO BENEFIT FOREIGNERS RATHER THAN AMERICANS.... and lose all those payroll taxes?
