Expanding the HB1to have students from other countries come before the American kids is absurd! Our children need to
have the first right to be allowed to find jobs and have the upper hand over foreigners. Bringing in these foreigners allows
infiltration of terrorism. Besides once these kids come to America they never go home or renew their Visa's, no way to 
keep track of them. They kill Americans and hide back in their countries. All they need are knives. How can you subject 
our families to this Bureaucracy 
Our own American children should have the Privilege to have my hard earned taxes spent where I see fit not you! 

"...expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT)through which employers hire 
more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visasbut do not even guarantee that those 
foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer 
science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in 
other fields."
