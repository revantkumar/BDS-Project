yin niu I support the OPT extension policy, and the reason is that some people think the opt extension will take jobs from US students, however it is the opposite, it will create more jobs, for example the foreign students who are starting up a new company will create more job opportunities, also more foreign talented students will let the company be much powerful in the market, meanwhile more job opportunities will be added as the economy being better. In sum, if you look at it in the long-term benefit, the OPT extension policy will definitely be the best for United State.
