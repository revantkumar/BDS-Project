I strongly support the extension of OPT for STEM students. For my own case, I am a PhD student in US and I get stipend from university and my advisor, which is ~$90,000 per year including tuition for at least five years and ~$500,000 in total. Since the main purpose of PhD is training, I can not make practical contribution in this time period. I can definitely go back to my own country after graduation, which is mandatory if I get stipend from our government. I do appreciate the scholarship from US universities and government and I do want to pay back to US. I am only one of the thousands of STEM PhD students here. I am sure that with the extension of OPT, more PhD students will work in US after graduation for several years, which will definitely make a considerate amount of contribution to US.
