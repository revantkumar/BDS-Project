This program has already denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs (2009 - 2013) and removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds according to a Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies.
The original purpose of the OPT Program was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned. The program is now being used by foreign students as a means to stay in the US, and is another attempt to undermine job opportunities for American workers. This new proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the program and must be scrapped. There is no rational reason to continue this program.
