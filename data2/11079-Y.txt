I agree to this proposal. Improving and expanding OPT for F-1 students are good for the economy as well as the development of the job market of the nation. In fact the economy based on technology (including engineering company and technology service in financial institute & consulting etc) largely depends on the foreign labor. In another word, without those foreign talent US is impossible to run so many engineering company and other tech service. There is a counter example Japan. Economy of Japan flourishes in the 1990s but cooled down afterwards. One of the significant reasons for that is they are not able to absorb plenty of foreign talents. US was exactly taking this advantage of absorbing foreign talents to keep our economy in the leading position in these decades. Somebody may say the OPT threatened the job opportunities for residents. The extend of negative influence, however, is negligible. Due to their linguistic drawback, foreigners have more difficulties in finding a job comparing to residents in the approximately same level. Those who successfully find jobs are really talented and can definitely make large contribution to the development of the nation. And the reasonable competition they bring about is good for the job market.
