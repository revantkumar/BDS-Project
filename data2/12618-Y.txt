This is a very good and useful proposal. 

First of all, the highly educated people who graduate from any American university, especially those who get STEM degrees, are great treasures of the United States. We should keep them and let them serve our country, instead of helping our opponents. The current immigration regulation makes it very difficult to keep these people: the number of the H1B visa every year is much fewer than that of the applicants. So this OPT extension for STEM degrees is the right solution to help this situation.

In addition, the United States is built on the immigrants. Every generation of immigrants brings new culture and new wisdom to this country, which makes it the best and most attractive place in the world. This is the reason why the United States is the most powerful and advanced country in the world. Limiting the students who learn the knowledge from the American universities to find a job in this country not only kills the biggest motivation that keeps this country stronger, but also ruins the foundation of the American dream, which is freedom and hardworking. 

People may complain that immigrants steal their jobs, but what is the real reason that these people lost their jobs? Is it because that the immigrants are immigrants, or simply because they are better? No matter who work for the high-tech companies in Sillicon Valley or Boston, they all serve the people and the society of the United States. Do you want people who are not qualified to do these jobs simply because they are American, or you want someone who is actually capable?
