AS former small business owner who employed high tech workers, I request this regulation not be implemented. In addition to my personal experience I submitt the following justification for my request !

A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
