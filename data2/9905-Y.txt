My job as a computer programmer (and 0ver 80% of my co-workers) at 20th Century Insurance was eliminated in order to make room for a further increase of contractors from India (Kanbay and TaTa companies) in 1997. It was by no means the only company that took this route. 

Now you want to eliminate the chances for our teenagers and unskilled citizens to find jobs by expanding F-1 visas. Why (aside from investors greed and "perks" for co-operative politicians), do we have to import thousands of unskilled workers also? There is no way this can benefit OUR citizens, but perhaps 
you are not concerned in that regard? Perhaps immigrants are more important to you than US citizens?
