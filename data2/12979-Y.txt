The STEM students from international background contribute significantly to the working force and leadership in the tech, science, and education areas in US. They are very valuable for US to maintaining the leadership in these areas (which are fundamental for the economy and social life) in the world. At the same time, the job opportunities created for them will not affect the non-STEM majors and will not threaten the job opportunities in the native students in the STEM majors since there is often a shortage in the working force in these areas. 

At the meantime, it should be realized that the competition for getting these students are more severe from other countries such as China and India. So we should try our best to retain these students to contribute to US instead of losing them to other countries. These students will not only have no threat on existing job opportunities, they will be a substantial force to contribute to the creation of new job opportunities in the future.
