I strongly support this new OPT extension proposal.
Foreign students not only benefits the US education industry, but also benefit the local economies. From 2001 to 2012, foreign students contributed approximately $21.8 billion in tuition and $12.8 billion in other spending. The main reason we choose the USA to further our study is that we can apply OPT to grow our skills after graduation. Without OPT, the US college will lose thousands of foreign students, which will cause a disaster to the education industry and local economies.
