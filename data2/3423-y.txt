shaoqing gong I strongly agree with the STEM OPT extension, here are some reasons.

First of all, some people are worried that the STEM students would steal the jobs from American citizens. They are not stealing jobs, on the contrary, they are creating jobs. These foreigners are contributing to the economic growth by working and living here, they create products, inventions, and they consume goods, groceries and pay tax. These all fuel economic growth. Once the economy is good, jobs are created. OPT extension policy was made in 2008, when the US was suffering a great financial crisis, but look how good the economy is nowadays. I wouldnt say its all because of the STEM extension policy, but it must have something to do with it.

Second, if OPT extension is canceled, more than 10 thousand people will have to leave the country, leaving the positions empty, and the high-tech companies have to find the qualified people to fill the positions by February ( The majority of the positions need professional, experienced skills, they are not like jobs in McDonalds that everybody can do). If they cannot find the right candidates to fit these positions in time, it would be a big loss to those high-tech companies, and it would be a big loss to this country as well.

Last, if we take a look at the US history, the reason why it became the greatest country in such a short time and still keeps leading the world is because IT WELCOMES TALENTED, CREATIVE PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD. And the STEM students are one of them. They are making a great contribution to this country with their intelligence and perspiration, I cannot imagine what America would be if it deported those talented, intelligent elites.
