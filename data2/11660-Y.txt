Granting more OPT extension time to stem major students won't hurt US citizen's opportunities for jobs. First of all, tons of companies in US needs talents excelling at stem areas. Even these companies hire all of qualified US citizens. There are still millions of cap left, which will slow down US economy badly. Secondly, once these companies get enough excellent stem major workers, these companies could compete in a higher level globally, creating more jobs for US. Thirdly, most degrees are not eligible for this new rule. In another word, US citizens still have gigantic advantage when looking for jobs. 

This new rule benefits country as well in the long term. The term stem degree is important. The invention of computer, smartphone,TV and so on, are the contributions of stem major people. It is known that a limit number of H1b is granted to nonimmigrant workers. Without giving more OPT extension time to Stem degree students, more and more OPT degree students have to leave for other countries for jobs. Losing these smart workers is a sadly huge loss for US. 

Therefore this new rule is definitely helping the country to attract more talents and to keep its leading status in most areas in the world.
