Jiao Wang I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons.

1. The international students who will have the opportunities to work in U.S for a period is not for take place of the U.S students, in the contrary, as long as they are same excellent, they have equal opportunity to get the job.

2. The best international students work in U.S will contribute to the economy and technology development of U.S. They shouldn't be discriminated because the nationality. In the contrary, it's more difficult for international students to get a job because the employer will pay fee to hire international students, so that only the best international students will get the opportunity to work. The best international students will contribute much to the development of U.S.

3. Even international students may cause pressure to local students to get job, but this will lead to all students to work harder. Therefore, there will be more excellent students and this will lead to more development of U.S.
