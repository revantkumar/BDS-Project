I strongly support this new proposed rule based on the following reasons:
1. F-1 students with STEM degrees will not compete with citizens for jobs. STEM degrees contains math, computer science, physics and other science and engineering majors. Most international students with these degrees will work for companies in these fields after they graduate. Companies in these fields are constantly growing and always in the need for more people with corresponding skills. In fact, the demand for skilled employees is almost always higher than the supply. Therefore, allowing F-1 students with STEM degrees to stay will fit such needs without decreasing job opportunities for US citizens.

2. Allowing those students to stay to work for the US will contribute to the US economy. After these students graduate, they may become software engineers who make novel technologies, data scientists or engineers in pharmacy who help make new drugs, mechanical engineers who make new products.
These people are working hard, making new technologies which create more job opportunities and increase consumption.
