I am an engineering student at RPI, and I am concerned about employment when I graduate. I do not believe it is fair that foreign students continue to be labeled as students remaining in the country on their F-1 visa when they have graduated and are working. OPT should not be expanded, it should not exist at all. It is merely a way for the government to avoid the H-1B cap - at least be honest about what you are doing. The payroll bonus employers receive for employing a foreigner is a scam and shameful. Quit depressing wages for STEM students and start looking after American workers.
