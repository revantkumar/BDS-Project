June Smith Why not support this proposal? Foreign students work really hard. They cost a lot come to USA and work harder than many local students. Have you ever seen the library of Friday night? There are full of Asian and Indian students! They deserve a better treat when they finish their study! I believe they will contribute much because they are smart, talent and work hard! Everyone should have the same opportunity!
