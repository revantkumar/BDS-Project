Support." Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students."

As a international STEM student, I would say, if the extension rule is abolished by US, I will turn to Austrilia and Canada with no doubt. A lot of international student will apply to other countries as well. This will cause US lose tuitions and academic reputation.
