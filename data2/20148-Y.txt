I strongly support the new OPT extension rule.

At the first place, the OPT extension rule will benefit the companies, especially tech-companies, in United States. Tech-companies in US has been growing rapidly and has boosted US' economy in the past few years. International technical employee has played a critical role in the process. People who are eligible for OPT extension hold a degree in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, are the very people who are of great significance to technology innovation. Often the research project in companies last several years, which requires the consistence of the project team. Without the OPT extension, tech-companies will be short of employee who are experts in technology and thus have a slower innovation cycle. On the other hand, with the OPT extension, more international young professionals will be able to bring latest skills and fresh thoughts to tech-companies and help US lead the innovation trend in technology.

What's more, the OPT extension rule will attract more international students to United States, rather than other countries. International students came to US are the best of the best in their home country. Their coming to US not only brings different culture to US students and stimulate their ways of thinking, but also aspire local students to work hard and remain the top academic level in the world. One important reason international students choose to come to US for study is that the current OPT rule enable them to gain several years of working experience. Without the OPT rule, the number of international students will decrease greatly and the benefit to US local students will no longer exist.
