F1 students from other countries in STEM field have made and are making great contribution to United States. Most of them are among the smartest and exceptional students in their own countries and are supported by scholarship provided by US funding agencies, it would be a great lost if they go back their home countries with all the technologies learned from U.S. for free. They are usually very diligent and thus form a positive power to encourage American citizens to work harder. And they only constitute less than 1% of the entire working force, so I won't worry that they will make Americans unemployed.
