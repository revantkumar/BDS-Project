I work in the human resource department of an IT company, as for me, I strongly support the OPT extension.
We hire many international students who graduate from computer science program and are excel at coding. Most of these international students come from India and China.They are smart and hardworking. Our company spend a lot of time and money on developing them into skillful and experienced IT engineers. Unfortunately, many of them have to leave US when their OPT end.This is a large loss for us. Everyone can understand what talent loss means to an IT company, and how hard it is to train an employee from beginning.
Besides, I've heard many of them said to me that some of their classmates think that 17 months OPT extension is not long enough for them to build a strong foundation of their careers. They'd rather spend these two years and a half in their home country instead of working in US. So that by the time when their working-in-US classmates get back, they may already make a difference somewhere.This is really understandable. But with the 24 months OPT extension, these students may change their minds and apply jobs in US first, so that we can have much more choices when hiring.
