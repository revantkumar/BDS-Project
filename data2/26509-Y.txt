I strongly support the 24-month extension of OPT of F1 nonimmigrants students. I reviewed some of the previous comments. It seems like many people opposed for the opposition itself. In the same time, they neglected the most important things in this whole process. More people devoted themselves in STEM related jobs would certainly boost economy of the United States without hurting the benefits of U.S. citizen. I hope people who are against it think through this issue and not classify the whole issue as a way foreign people take benefit of the rule. Also, it really hurt the feelings of tens of thousands of international students who devote so much effort to building a better world.
