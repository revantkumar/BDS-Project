I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. They deserve the chance.

2. Many foreigners contribute a lot to American society. Making use of their wisdom will keep America strong. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. American companies choose them not because they are cheap labour force, but because they win the competition in their specialized knowledge and ability.
