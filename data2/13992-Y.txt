I strongly support this new OPT extension rule!

Firstly, this is a great chance to help the U.S. obtain many smart and hard-working international students who can contribute their knowledge and skills to the technology companies in the U.S. If the U.S. does not have this OPT extension, international students would choose other countries to pursue their degree. The tuition from international student is a huge amount that can help increase the economy of the U.S. Students buy books, rent house and travel during their vacation, all money they spend will help promote the economic growth of the U.S. So the new OPT extension rule is really a great way to attract international students come to the U.S. and leave their money in the U.S.

Secondly, if the OPT extension cancelled right now, lots of international students cannot keep their work and leave their positions. Then technology industries in the U.S. will suffer a huge damage. Hundred thousand of skillful workers leave their work, the U.S. need a lot of time, several months, even several years to recruit and train new employees, which would of course affect the development of the technology companies. 

Lastly, somebody may say they cannot find jobs because the international students. But do you really think that the American want to recruit international person who speak bad English language? They have no choice!!!If there are lots of American pursuing their STEM degree and want to work for companies, of course American would prefer hire Americans! Because lack of employees, technology companies must to hire international students to help them. So if the rule cancelled right now, companies lost lots of employees, which would also influence the economic growth. 

Above all, the new OPT extension rule is a great rule to help both international students and the U.S. itself. I strongly agree to this new rules!
