OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. We must take care of our own citizens first. It is amazing to me how President Obama tells students to stay in school when the economy is depressed, and at the same time offer incentives to companies to hire foreigners. These positions should be available for our people when they finish their educations.
