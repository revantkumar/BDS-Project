First of all I would like to thank DHS/OMB team for working so hard to bring this rule in so less time to meet the deadline of the court.
This is definitely a great step towards retaining talent in US. However, there are some additional conditions brought up in this rule for the sake of monitoring the students like training mentorship program, reporting to DSO every 6 months. This will add some burden to students and employers. 
In reality, there is no training mentorship program that is created by any employer for any new recruit. The new recruit learns the processes by doing day to-day activity under the guidance of senior team members. There is no spoon feeding done. And this not expected from a Master's or Phd graduate to have spoon feeding. So creating a mentorship program does not make much sense in real world scenario. Plus updating the status of training every 6 months is also not a very good idea. This can be reduced to once in a year.
Extension of 7 more months will be beneficial to all international students. This new rule will motivate prospective students to apply in best US universities. With increase in number of application, competition between students will increase which will improve the quality and standard of students applying here.
