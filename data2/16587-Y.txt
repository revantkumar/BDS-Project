I am commenting here to fully support the STEM OPT extension proposal, simply because of the following points:

1. It is a no doubt MUST do thing to improve the U.S. education system, to ensure the international students have their rights to practice their knowledge learned from US universities. As well as to keep the diversity of the US campus. The 24 months period is absolutely not a long time since many of the job positions require 2 to 3 years to be slightly experienced, especially for STEM majors.

2. The negative impact of cancelling or shortening the OPT STEM extension is definitely a disaster for the US's economy. Since thousands of large corps and companies are depending on tens or thousands of employees with the needs of this STEM OPT extension.

3. The objections to this proposal are mostly due to their personal interests of hard to find jobs in STEM majors, while they fail to realize that competition exist from the first day of human history. Instead of asking the government to break the reasonable system and blaming foreign students, improving themselves' professional abilities and increasing self-values should be what they should be focusing on.
