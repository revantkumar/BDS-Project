Olivia Shen I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule. When I graduated from university in China, I had a lot of choice to continue my master study in U.S, Canada, Hong Kong, British or Singapore. But I finally choose to study in U.S, because U.S can provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. Therefore, it's obvious taht OPT extension rule is a key factor to STEM talents when choosing their graduate school. I don't think U.S universities can still attract large amount of foreign STEM talents to come and study, and make contributions after their graduation every year. For me, if there is no OPT extensions rules, I will probably choose to study in other countries with better policy for foreign STEM talents. Besides, if this rule is terminated Feb next year, it's definitely a disaster to most silicon valley companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Apple, Google, since STEM talents is a very large and important part in these companies.

Moreover, 12 months regular + 24 month extension is a good length for OPT program. According to my current work experience in SK Hynix, most large projects would last for at least 3 years. If there is no OPT extension, and with the limited number of H1B visa every year, most foreign STEM workers who act as an important part in the project have to quit the job and go back to their hometown. Then, the company has to hire and train another engineer which is a timing wasting job during the project period. It's not only a loss to the company, but also a loss to the U.S industry.

Until now, I didn't see any negative point of this OPT extension rule. Hope more people support this wonderful rule!
