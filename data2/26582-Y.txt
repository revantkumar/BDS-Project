I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. What makes the US strong is its diversity, by allowing longer opt extension, US can attracts more international students with strong technology skills that will definitely secure the position of the US as the world leader.
2. The international students working in the US are making great contributions to the country, they are mainly working in high-tech industry, which will boost the economy and creates more job opportunities for the American people. 
The OPT extension will benefit both international students and American people, so I strongly support it.
