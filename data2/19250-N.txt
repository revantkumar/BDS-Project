The job market for college graduates is abysmal regardless of the color of your skin. This is a good example of equality under both political parties, that of preferential treatment of other country's citizens over our own American citizens. Peter Schiff made a video asking college students why they are working menial jobs and the answer was they could not find better jobs. The responsibility of the federal Government is to its citizens above other country's citizens. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXpwAOHJsxg 

The reason for the unparalleled anger in this country right now is because the government has set a group of people above and outside the law, above and to the detriment of the welfare of our citizens. Do what is right; protect our people's right to have a job and support their families.
