Chao Xu OPT extension is good for many areas: overseas students will pay house rent to the American owners; Even if they consider to find a job in the US, the available seats for international students are limited, if the employer can find a domestic candidate, they won't give the chance to international students, since the documents are complicated and they would pay much money on it. Hence the employers would recruit international students only if they cannot find any suitable domestic applicant. OPT will give, rather than higher competition rate for American, but allow more foreigns to work for the states in the fields that American not willing/able to.
