We , Americans do not have jobs .Our children are going to school hungry and our govenment wants to bring foring workes so they can take our jobs .Money, what we had left from previous jobs were stolen from us by our govenment in form of all kind of taxes.We ,the middle class ,are supporting all free loaders ,all illigals ,all bussinesses ..and enough is enough .Do you want to start another revolution? We can not stand any more sytuation ,when everything from us is taken by govenment and wasted .We want jobs ,we want to keep our hard earn money for our own children ,for their education ,for their well been.Instead everything is taken from us and given for waste or for illigals or for people,who never want to touch any job.
