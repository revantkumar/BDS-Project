The fact the DHS is protecting and allowing F-1 Non immigrant Students to become hired over American Students and workers says that there is something very wrong with the DHS and our Government. Many of the students and workers that I help to find jobs are filled by illegal or F-1 nonimmigrants.
We truly need to protect American jobs for Americans first. Please reconsider the impact that you are having on the country that you are serving.
