I strongly support expanding Training Opportunities for F1 Non-immigrant Students with STEM Degree and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. 
In terms of economics, international student will have a positive influence for the growth of consumerism. International students need to pay foods, bill for electricity and gas, clothes and cars, and they will use the money which is originally from another country to pay American tax. In economics, one way to increase the economic is to increase consumption. Supporting this rule will attract more and more students to America and allowing the international students staying a relatively longer time. So the tax they paid and the consumption growth will definitely have a positive influence for American. 
For hundreds of years, one of the reasons why America's culture influenced generations of people all over the world is that America support and spread the rights of freedom for all human beings. People in America have the free right to speech, free right to vote. Many intelligent students from all over the world deciding to come to America for the purpose of broadening their horizons and acquiring knowledge. All the international students could work just like a bridge for the countries all over the world, and increase the efficiency of spreading the right of freedom for human beings all over the world. Supporting this rule may attract more and more students all over the world and spread the spirit of America.
