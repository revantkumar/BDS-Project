Brian Avery You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions. There will be adequate time for students to devote for the country where they studied several years..
