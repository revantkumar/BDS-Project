It is beyond reason that foreign STEM students should be given additional months/years in the U.S. and work in jobs/industries that our American students need.

How in the world will ICE ever be able to locate all these thousands of foreign students once they are in the U.S.? And how many of these foreign students will not have
the best interest of the U.S. in their minds?

I definitely oppose any changes in the current program, and actually feel that the program should be whittled down to having much fewer foreign students.
