Sharon Han I support the rule of improving and expanding STEM OPT for F-1 students. 
Although that giving international students working permission sounds to reduce the opportunities of US citizens, actually, this rule will not worsen job market for US citizens, instead, it may create more job opportunities in future. There are not a lot of US citizen pursuing degrees in STEM area. US citizens are more interested in more practical or professional degrees. If we do not hire those international students, those companies will face lack of employees. Most those employees are tech companies which invent new technologies, develop very quickly, and create many job opportunities all over the country. If they could not hire enough tech people, those companies will not develop well and fast. It will slow the economy in US and maybe increase US citizens unemployed rate. 
Therefore, we should keeps those young, well-educated and smart international students in STEM area working here.
