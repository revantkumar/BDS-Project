I think this is a valid chance for these students to contribute to the economy here and also gain valuable experience. This will allow students to realize the value of the large amount of money they spend to come here. In a time when higher education institutions in other countries are racing ahead in terms of enrollment and attracting students, this would make the US an attractive target for students. International students contribute large sums of money to higher education institutions' revenue and also a significant amount of revenue to the local economies of the cities they come to.
