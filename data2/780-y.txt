Haoran Liu I strongly support the extension of OPT, which will benefit both US economy and international student.

US education is attractive to international students because it gives to international STEM students an opportunity to contribute their talented mind into the most state-of-the-art technologies. International students will be hesitated to pay huge amount of tuition to just get a degree. As a result, US education will lose its worldwide competency if OPT doesn't give students enough time to get good training.

Many high tech companies look for creative minds and fresh idea in their research and development. Many international STEM students are well qualified to join this effort to benefit the whole US society. The extension of OPT is a good way to retain the talented people from all the world.

This is a win win policy, which should be approved of course.
