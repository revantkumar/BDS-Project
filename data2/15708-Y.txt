I fully support the decision to expand the OPT STEM extension for F1 students from 17 months to 24 months. I believe that this is a great step towards improving the training opportunities for F1 students. Having completed their education at reputed schools, these students will be a great asset to the workplace and will help create healthy competitiveness, and will contribute in a positive way to the country. 
It is very important for these students to be able to have training opportunities without having to constantly keep thinking about their immigrant status, and I think this is a great step in that direction.
