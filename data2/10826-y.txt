Ajeet Kumar Sahu STEM OPT Extension is a great move. 

I appreciate expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. This will be a very positive step towards attracting more students from foreign countries to come and study in American universities. Students from foreign countries not only produce huge revenue through education but also fulfill ever increasing demand of Scientists and Engineers in America. 
If the training period is decreased it will only repel students from coming to America for higher studies. This will lead to loss of huge revenue to American economy. It will also increase gap of supply and demand of engineers and scientists in expanding industry. Companies will have to hire engineers and researchers from foreign countries. 
I want to use this opportunity to fully support new proposed extension of training period for STEM courses.
