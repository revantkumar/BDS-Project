International students have dedicated a lot to America economy. 
Firstly, the cancellation of stem extension definitely will dramatically reduce the number of international students coming to the U.S. to study. 
Secondly, many of international students had decent education background with solid technical skills. The value of these people is unmeasureble, they promote technology development and innovation. Isn't innovation the determinant element for American economic development? Many international students took the hardest job like computer coding that most of Americans are even reluctant or not qualified to do! America should always be the fair ground where talented and hard-working people get their goal achieved and contribute to the improvement of the country. This is the real American spirit!!!
