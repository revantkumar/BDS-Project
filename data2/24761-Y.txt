This proposal is good for US economics. Since the international students have already studied in US for couple years, we should keep them at least working for US for several years rather than sending them away immediately. By keeping them working for several years, they can contribute to the US economics, especially in high-tech industry. By sending them back to their home countries, we instead help other countries training their employees and boost their competitive power. It does not make sense to us.
