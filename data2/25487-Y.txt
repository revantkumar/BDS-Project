As an American citizen, with many talented international artist friends, I am in full support of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. I support the cause because having personal experience with many of these talented international students / post-students, I can sincerely say their work-ethic and vision for a progressive future through an artistic lens is something that should only be granted support. Moreover, I am in full support of breaking geographical boundaries for individuals whose passion is to improve the world through art.
