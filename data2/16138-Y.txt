I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

First, those students learned knowledge from U.S. universities, we should stay in the country and let them make contributions to the U.S. Many of them are top students in a lot of fields and they should have this opportunity.

Second, diversity is a pretty important factor for the U.S. to be so successful in the world. I believe that the U.S. should judge a person by his/her ability but not based on their citizenship.

At last, those American companies would like to hire more international students because they do contribute a lot and the companies can not find enough American employee in those specific fields. Competition is always a good thing.
