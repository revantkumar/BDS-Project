I have been a tax paying citizen of this country for 69 years. I have a 26 year old son who cannot afford to go to college. Little things like housing, transportation, food and health care (and he couldn't AFFORD the new health care being offered) are a little important along with being able to qualify for educational funding. 
He works an $8.50 an hour job and is fortunate to have it... jobs being what they are...
He is a type I diabetic and has struggled with that for several years with no help from insurance.
We don't NEED more immigration.
We NEED jobs for our own country!!
