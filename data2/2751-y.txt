Chen Pang I strongly support the proposal of DHS, and hope DHS could even extend OPT program further or directly grant permanent resident status to whoever holds an advanced degree in STEM fields from a US university.

The top reason that America has been successful in the past century is that is able to attract talents from around the globe. If it keeps making it difficult for foreign talents to come to this country and attempts to rely on its own tiny talent pool, it will almost certainly lose its advantages and becomes a second or third class country in the world. Top companies would have to move outside, and the next line of great companies would not even care about America. The end result would be very bad for all Americans.
