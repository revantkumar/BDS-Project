Overall I believe this is a very important measure to make sure that US still dominates technology industry in the world by bringing bright/capable talents from all over the world to work for US. USA is a country built from immigrants and benefits from immigrants the most compared to other western countries. Immigrants and the diversity along with it plays a vital role in US economy especially in the technology field. Without immigrants, especially those with skills in STEM, it's hard to imagine how the US economy can compete with other majors countries around the globe.

Think about some of the major IT companies in US, Google, Apple, Qualcomm, CISCO. Many of their employees are actually those F-1 Nonimmigrant Students majoring in STEM. If OPT time is shortened, they will be the first ones to be impacted. Many people in the comments think that would not make a difference, but I believe, without those employees, these US IT companies will become less competitive. In the future, you might use phones made by Chinese phone makers; do your search in Baidu, chat with your friends in Wechat (They are all Chinese products).

If US still wants to keep it potential, keep it as the dominance in the world, it should "improve and Expand Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students".
