I HIGHLY SUPPORT this rule. It can benefit various industries, especially IT industry, in the long run by attracting and retain those STEM talents. US companies depend heavily on international stem graduates to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue, which later contribute to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit all US citizens. 

Those opponents may have the arguments that US citizens are losing jobs because of those international students. I think such arguments untenable. Many US citizens are laid off in an industry irrelevant to science and technology industries. Moreover, US science and tech industries are always looking for well-educated talents. If those US citizens have the same skill sets required by those high-tech companies as those nonimmigrant students, those companies will prefer US citizens since they have more stable status and stronger communication skills. 

If those stem students are expelled from the US, those laid-off US citizens can hardly find a good position in such high-tech industries. Those high-tech companies will become the biggest victims and the economy of the US will suffer a lot. 

Those opponents may hold another claim that those nonimmigrant students are hired with much lower wage than the US citizens. This is definitely not true considering the average income in the IT industries. But I do suggest that DHS or relevant department can monitor and regulate some small companies so that a fair wage can be ensured for all the labors.
