Having personally been affected by the horrible H1-b visa system in this country, I can say that I am dead set against allowing these students to stay in this country any longer than necessary. 

As others have testified, I, too, had to train my replacements. It is a demoralizing, soul sucking task. 

We DO NOT need anymore STEM workers from outside of this country, especially from India. There are plenty of American citizens that can fulfill these requirements. Why don't we let these visas expire and not bring in any more immigrants and see what happens. I guarantee that wages would rise and the American people would have a chance of lifting themselves up. Also, more taxes being paid by Americans can't be all bad, as opposed to these visas that don't require any taxes or social security to be paid. Who wouldn't want to employ someone that you can pay a low salary and not have to pay taxes. Win for the employers, win for the immigrants, LOSS to American citizens.

Please do not extend the work duration of these students. This will only lead to a loss of more American jobs and the lowering of the middle class.

Sincerely,

Janet Hiller
