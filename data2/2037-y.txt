Raven Pan I support this proposal because I do not think international students in STEM will have a adverse effect on US workers. STEM industries are growing fast and the need for STEM people are increasing dramatically. So international students are not occupying positions for US workers. Also STEM students are specialized workers who get high salaries from big companies. So they would not compete with workers in other industries and get lower salaries than US workers.
