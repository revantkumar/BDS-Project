I strongly recommend this proposed rule.

This is a long awaited rule and should've been implemented much earlier. By allowing only 12 months of OPT it is not fair to the international students who have come from far countries in order to obtain most advanced information on technology and to get hands on experience.

This is a nation built by immigrants. 

The land of the Free and home of the Brave should always be free to who ever wants to stay legally.
