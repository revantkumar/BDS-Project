I really support the proposal of expanding the OPT extension period to 24 months for F-1 nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees. The reason are as following.

First, as we can see that a lot of high-tech companies like Twitter and Seagate are laying off employees due to cost reduction or merging/acquisition. It is more challenging for the new-grads with STEM degrees to find their first job. There are a lot of talented new-grads and one of the most critical factor that limits them is the visa status. If the OPT extension period could be expanded to 24 months, it is obviously of great help to the new-grads and the companies.

Second, since each year all the students with F-1 that hired by their employers need to be in the H-1 visa "lottery". This is another critical factor that limits the F-1 students. Some of them tried very hard to find a job and their employer likes them a lot. But due to they could not win the "lottery", they have to quit their job and go back home. That is a big lost for both the students and the companies. So if the OPT extension could be expanded, they could get at one more chance to win the "lottery".

To be concluded, I greatly support the proposal of expanding the OPT extension period to 24 months. This will definitely benefit both the students and companies.
