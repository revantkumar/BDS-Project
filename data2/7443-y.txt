Siwen Ju I strongly support the 24 mouth OPT-extension. 
I'm a student working on Motion media field. This is a new major in media field. Our project related to a lot of new technology included Visual Reality, 3D animation. Those emerging technics are so new that every one in this field is exploring and developing even our professors and experts. So for a graduate student, 2 year study at school is not enough for us to know this rapid developing field thoroughly. So the extension provides us an opportunity to strengthen our skills under this situation. As the same time, since it is so new that all the exploration we done here in US also a contribution to the US motion industry. Over all, the extension has benefit for both our international students and US entertainment industry. For students, during the extension, we can enhance their skills and better accomplish our study goal. For US society, our contribution to those emerging industry can also boost the development of the new born technology. Please see this extension in a different perspective. Thanks.
