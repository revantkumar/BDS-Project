I support for this proposal of expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.
For students, they have longer time to stay at U.S. and are legally to work in their field. Students in STEM field could apply their academic knowledge in a work setting and better positioned to begin careers in their study filed. Those on-the-job educational experiences would help students gain smooth transition from fresh graduation student to fresh professional work force in the community.
Meanwhile, the proposed changes would also help nation's colleges and universities remain their strong attractions to international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States. More international students in STEM could become part of nation's workforce in a longer period. Those international students would apply their knowledge, innovation, and ideas to companies, industries and communities in the United States and make huge contributions to the technology development in the nation. 
This proposal would be a win-win for both STEM international students and the United States.
