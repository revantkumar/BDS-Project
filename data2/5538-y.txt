zehong Ma Another reason that I SUPPORT this proposal is that:

This proposal will be benefit those companies who want to explore Chinese market. According to the research, 65% of Chinese student will go back to China after working in US for 1-2 years. And for most of them, the priority choice is to working in US company.

There are a lot of US company have branch company in China. Those people who have both US working experience and deep understanding of Chinese culture would provide a lot of help for those companies who want to expand Chinese market.

Opt with 24 months extension would give these Chinese students enough time to accumulate working experience and thus would provide more help when they go back to China and working in US company.
