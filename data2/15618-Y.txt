Personally, I support the 24 months OPT extension plan. 
According to NAFSA (http://www.nafsa.org/Explore_International_Education/Impact/Data_And_Statistics/NAFSA_International_Student_Economic_Value_Tool/)

"The 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to 2014 NAFSA findings. This is a 8.5% increase in job support and creation, and a nearly 12% increase in dollars contributed to the economy from the previous academic year"

Among the jobs created, there are 123465 direct jobs ( Higher Education) plus 216543 indirect jobs (Transportation, dining, insurance. etc).
The OPT is a great attraction for the international students to come to US for their education. Without the OPT extension, US may lose a lot of international students which will affect the economy. 

In addition, there is a report on US news (http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real) indicating "there are currently three job vacancies advertised online for every unemployed computer worker; by contrast, there are more than six unemployed construction workers per vacancy." This was reported in the September of 2014 but I think it may still valid until now since the STEM students I know all got their jobs quickly after their graduation. 

To me it seems the plan is beneficial for both US society and international students, I would vote yes for the OPT extension plan
