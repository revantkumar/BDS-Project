OPT is one of the major reasons international students chose to study and get a degree in U.S.. To be honest, currently 17 months OPT is not a long time for them to achieve a promising academic project or industrial goal and it is not very fruitful for most people, which is conflictive with the legislation of OPT at the first place. Many of them need longer practice time for their first internship/job. So expanding OPT time can help attracting more international students to come to U.S. 
International students contributed over 27 billion dollars to the U.S. economy in 2013/14, which can be regarded as a super large investment to the local U.S., especially during economic weakness. Since we cannot attract more international students by improving our current education quality, expanding OPT is quite a good choice. I support the OPT expanding.
