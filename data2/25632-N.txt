OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

This is just wrong. Hire american workers nobody else. Support your own country not people from other countries. People in the USA need jobs to support their own families. Lets make America great again.
