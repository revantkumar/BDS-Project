G zen I support extending the OPT for STEM degree holders because that strenghthens the global competitiveness of US companies and the US economy. And ultimately benefitting every american. Thr unitrd states have the best high education system and attracted the brightest students globally. These students were trained and now we want to send them back to compete with US because of the Visa cap? What we should do is to revisit the H1b visa program and limit the visa abuse from indian consulting companies, not sending these American universities trained students out of the country.
