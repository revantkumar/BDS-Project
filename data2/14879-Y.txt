I totally support 24-month OPT. I do not think this puts any priority for foreign students over citizens. This only gives more equality for those smart talented foreign students in the job markets who already have a lot more restrictions than citizens. Employers do not need to choose foreigners, and they only choose the best candidates. It is always favorable for US economy to attract more capable people around the world. Keep in mind that those OPT students are typically the best source of immigrants to US. They not only make great contributions to US companies, and also generate new job opportunities. There are so many famous employers founded by immigrants, e.g., Yahoo, WhatsApp, Ebay, etc. Attracting best talents is what makes USA unique and what makes USA the best country in the world.

The spirit of equality is one of the core values of America. All Americans are originally immigrants who came to this land to embrace equality and freedom. Opinions against this proposal is against the American core values.
