jingrui zhang United states was an original immigrant country. It outperforms the old school west nations due to its openness and revolution spirit. I think this proposal is definitely the way to attract more talented and innovative students to contribute to this country. I have met many of the F1 students and I have to say most of them, carrying an careful and serious spirit to their abroad study life, are really hardworking students. They not only enrich our diversity but also contributes huge amount of energy and impact in many industries such as computer science, accounting and financial banking. I really support this proposal and I think they deserve this opportunity.
