Norah L I strongly support OPT extension for three reasons. 

First of all, extension will attract more foreign students to studying in the U.S. which brings in a lot of investment in education. 

Second, people who come to U.S. are the elites in their own countries. They often gain a Master or a PhD degree in Unite States. Given more opportunity to work, they will be willing to stay in U.S. We can expect a large number of labor force of highest quality.

At last, OPT extension cost little budget from U.S. government. 

In sum, OPT extension is a beneficial program to U.S. society.
