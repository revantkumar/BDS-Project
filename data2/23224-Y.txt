I support this proposal because that is all about American Dream. If a student is capable to pursue his or her degree in certain fields, which affirm his or her ability of learning and working at these fields. 
The reason why the US is so advanced compared to other countries was Americans were so open-minded, which attracted a number of professors and academies through out the years. In order to keep American going to a further position, international students are essential.
Thomas Jefferson once said: "America is for everybody." But people are emotional, usually in a wrong way. Nowadays some people blame international students for high unemployment rate, that is absurd, because some jobs, which are taken by international students, are not even desirable for Americans. When more people have a hope, to work for his or her own future, they will work hard and in general, prosper the society.
