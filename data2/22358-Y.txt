Thanks for your opinion. But I disagree for the following reasons:
Spending money is not always bad first of all. 
By spending little money, we could get great benefit which may not appear in a short run and that is exactly why we shouldn't be shortsighted. 
Spending money unwisely is what we do not want. And OPT extension is definitely not like that. Education is where we want to invest the most.
