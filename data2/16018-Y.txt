I'm strongly support this new proposal. I've roughly looked through others comments, especially the negative ones. 

Most of them are talking about the F-1 students would take the job opportunities of US citizens with longer OPT periods. Well, I'd like to say international students are here in the US to achieve their American Dreams, just like anyone else in this place. I Believe the American Dreams declares that life should be better and richer and fuller for EVERYONE, with opportunity for EACH according to ability or achievements.

After several years education here in the US universities, the STEM students desire to make lives better and also make the world better based on the knowledge and skills they learned. 

Sincerely, Xiyu Li
