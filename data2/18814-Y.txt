This rule would be extremely helpful for me as an international PHD student in the major of Computer Engineering. 

Firstly, as a PHD student, during the long period of program, I'm required to conduct multiple internships in industry companies in order to finish the program. Either CPT or OPT is required to be used for the internship. The available CPT time is limited (less than 12 months), hence, having a longer OPT period will enable me to have no problems in these internships and thus better finish my PHD program. 

Secondly, an extension of the OPT would provide me a higher chance to get the working visa (H1b). If the OPT is 12 months, then I only have one time chance to get the H1b visa. With a 12 months OPT and only one chance to participate the H1b "lottery", I no longer believe that I would be so lucky to work here. However, if the OPT is extended, I would have more than on chance to participate the H1b selection process, which highly increase my chance to work here. 

I believe that companies would also warmly welcome to see this rule to be activated, so that they would not be annoyed with H1b things when hiring people, and thus have higher chances to hire better employers in general. 

Finally, a longer OPT would enable me to have better preparation for participating work after graduation.
