The DHS's plan to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. This program artificially expands the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields -- resulting in put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
