Please accept my comment on the proposed rule by DHS to extend the Optional Practical Training period. This rule is very helpful to the American economy and is also helpful for most of the hard working international students who will benefit from the professional job experience that they can gain only in the US before going to their respective countries.

I would like to point out that this rule has No Effect on Americans who are as qualified as the international students who are in the job market. In my 3 years of experience I've seen companies always selecting American students over international, reasons being : better communication skills, no added paper work, no extra fees associated with hiring an international candidates, and so on. Apart from that, international students can NOT APPLY into companies that are DOD contractors and in STEM courses it would account for nearly 70% of jobs in the market. The international students do not get any level of security clearance and thus don't fit into many jobs. Basically, international students only get to apply for 30% of the job market and even there a similarly qualified American candidate gets the job.

Regarding the wages, the labour laws in the US guarantee same basic pay to everyone irrespective of whether they are American citizens or International, rather the international students need to be sponsored and have added fees associated with paperwork and legal work.

In this world of globalization American companies have set up their base of operations in many different countries and so require training students with US education that can represent those companies globally. The boundaries between countries and nationalities are shrinking in this globalized world and rules such as the STEM otp extension help carry America's name in a very positive manner.

I would suggest that this rule be extended to 36 months.
