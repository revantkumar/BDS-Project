As we know a great country need a large group of great people to dedication and contribution. Since this extension is for STEM degree student, which the majority had high level education background and hi-tech practical ability in their field, this incredible power of knowledge and large amount of human resources is really essential for me, for us, for everyone who lived in America. Look at the blow-up at computer science, it is impossible to make such achievement and you will never have chance to use your iPhone, android, Mac, Windows now without the joint efforts of STEM foreign f-1 students, let along many other field that contains the achievement relate to us everyone's daily life such as Boeing jet, ocean oil platform, advanced natural disaster prevention, hi-tech material for aerospace engineering or even for your new Ford. It's true that you will say we American in this pride homeland will also make that achievement by ourself, but we might use it ten or twenty or fifty years later, not today due to the huge amount of mass need to deal with but with limit human resources. I believe inclosive mind and share make us gain more.
