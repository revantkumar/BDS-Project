I'm always proud of my degree earned during my years in United States. It's one of the hardest working period of time in my life. I'm an international student who is now working at a high tech IT company in the silicon valley after graduation. it's been huge that I spent my last two year study in a top university in US and contributes everything back to the country. Whatever I've learned is so fascinating and cutting-edge that only groups of experts really understand what it means. As most of nonimmigrant students would care that the status of working legally within US is not permanent before you even get a H1B visa. People would seize opportunity every day in US working and try to do the best of themselves, today US attracts world's top experts and most talented people to blend in and work together, as well as training the best class of students out of finest education resources and strongest support, with a high budget of government. People receive degree and most up-to-date training and that's what the industies or institutions want exactly, if they can't make themselves useful in the real world, it's definitly a great waste of time and efforts, it's as if people try to get training programs done and make money out of tickets that required to join the program, the real deal here is not about making money anymore, it's accelerating the development of the knowledge systems. If denials of nonimmigration students training opportunities, it's just too simple and naive to make the problem more transparent, anything would change for sure, but definitly not in the correct direction.
