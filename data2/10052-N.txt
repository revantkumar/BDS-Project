I am a retiree from Western Michigan University and the way Companies don't want to hire Americans sucks, and they abuse {H-1B} and OPT to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas. Our government needs to support Americans first, then foreign nationals. Americans pay taxes to support government agencies and we taxpayers should reap the rewards for our contributions.
