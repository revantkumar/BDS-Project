Why on earth would I be in favor of giving foreign students rights on positions over our own student citizens...or is that politically incorrect to ask such a question? From this I'm sure you have determined that I am NOT in favor of financially enhancing foreign student access to available positions over our own people....PERIOD. I am disgusted with Ocrapa's (obama) immigration folly. Why is it, the illegals and foreigners get more rights than tax paying citizens? They seem to have a permanent "get out of jail free" card. What's the deal on that? And this "Sanctuary City" crap is exactly that...CRAP! Everything Ocrapa does turns into a giant FOLLY. When it comes to wisdom...what some call a "President" could be compared with a dead grasshopper.
