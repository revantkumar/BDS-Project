Adam Gabbert I SUPPORT the rule. Many tech companies are short of talented technical workers and many of them are international students who major in CS&EE. If the rule canceled, we will lose these skilled workers ,which does harm to the economy and impedes the development of the company I work in. 
And my colleagues from other countries are diligent and hardworking. They bring benefit to us. CANNOT imagine what will happen if they have to leave our country because of canceling the rule!!!!!
