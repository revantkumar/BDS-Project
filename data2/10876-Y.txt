I support this new rule. US need international students for tuition."Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students." OPT extension make US more attractive among those countries. Lot of students come to US and they want to get real practice after graduation. If the extension is abolish, why don't they choose schools in Canada for lower tuition and longer working period?
