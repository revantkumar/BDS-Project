David Flora I wish to comment on the U.S. government's policy of allowing up to a million immigrants into our country annually. 

It is common knowledge, that there are millions of Americans who are either unemployed or underemployed. The very idea of allowing more and more foreign workers to come here and take jobs that Americans could be doing is absolutely absurd. This policy should be terminated immediately. We are not obligated to foreigners. Put Americans first.
