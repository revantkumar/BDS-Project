I am supporting this document!

I wrote an article yesterday regarding I think this OPT extension is pretty important, I would like to re-emphasize today the importance as to any international students. For those who are dedicating to their study and choose to stay in America, but not serving their countries in the high tech (aka STEM program) industry, they deserve the chances to have more time apply their knowledge at where they studied. It is mutual beneficial without any doubt.

We have learned from the past that a country can become strong when they open their doors to welcome new and advanced technologies, and today people are the most treasurous things you can ever have. 

Besides foreigners like me who work at America already as a H1B, probably green card or citizen in the future, who love to stay if we see more and more people coming from the same countries. If we start to see America is trying to refuse them step by step, like disapproving this proposition, I cannot image what others think, but I would certainly feel very negatively.
