I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training

program.People tell me all the time how hard it is to find work. People coming across the border are taking a lot of jobs around 

here in the Chicago area. Many can't even speak English. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent 

U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition . If you 

could hire a us citizen and have to pay social security taxes or hire a foreign student and NOT pay the taxes what would you

do?

It puts our own people at a disadvantage they don't need right now. Count me as a NO on this issue.
