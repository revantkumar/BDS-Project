I strongly support this proposed rule in the interest of our nation. We could not have come this far without contributions of highly skilled temporary workers, who graduated from US universities. 
The U.S. is still the top destination for migrations, but that this is something that should not be taken for granted. The other countries are attracting not only a higher share of migrants, but also migrants from the top universities in the world. The U.S. attracted 24 percent of graduates from the top 500 universities worldwide in 2000, but just 12 percent in 2012. 

We should make full use of the students educated in the US and give enough time for them to contribute towards our economic growth.
