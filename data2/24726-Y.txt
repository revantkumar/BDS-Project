Great proposal, fully support it. 
Extending the OPT program is a crucial step towards allowing the best and brightest students who come here to receive a world-class education with the opportunity to stay and work, start businesses, and contribute to our economy.

While we continue fighting every day to find a permanent solution to fix our broken immigration system, it's important that today we take action to support immigrant students studying in our country.
