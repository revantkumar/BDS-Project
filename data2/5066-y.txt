Dung Phan I strongly agree with the proposal to lengthen STEM extension period for OPT. I strongly believe that the proposal will benefit not only international students in STEM fields but also the U.S. educational system, U.S. employers, and the United States. The U.S. educational system will remain globally competitive. U.S. employers have access to the skills acquired by STEM OPT students. Retention of STEM OPT students will enhance the nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness. I also think the outlined provisions in the proposal will protect U.S. workers.
