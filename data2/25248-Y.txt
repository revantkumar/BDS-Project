I think the extension of OPT for the STEM is very important.

1. Nowadays lots of people cannot get the chance to obtain a H1B visa, if the extension is cancelled so they cannot work here any more. This will be a huge destroy to the technology development to the US.

2. The international student will not occupy too much positions which make native student hard to find a job. Every one has the same process to be employed. If you do not have the ability to be employed, no matter where are you from, you will not be considered. 

So I think OPT extension for STEM is necessary.
