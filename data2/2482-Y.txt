With the world in termoil and the US broke, it is time to stop immigration from the Middle East and Asia. We also need to close our borders . I think it is very important to know who we have in this country and be able to track them, that when their visa's run out they can be sent home or have the visa renewed.
I think it is also very important that the Citizens of the United States get first chances at jobs. If they aren't qualified that is one thing. But to bring someone in from another country to take their jobs is just wrong. I don't care what degree they have.
