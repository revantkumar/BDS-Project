I think this regulation is helping the US to keep educated foreigners in the states. Many smart young people come to the US to learn the most advanced technology and knowledge. After graduation, they wish to stay in the US to gain experience in the top companies. They can make huge contribution to those companies and thus the country as a whole. Considering the US as a immigration country with lots of opportunities, this rule is helping the young people from US universities to extend their stay and contribute their knowledge for the US.

Furthermore, many PhD students from foreign countries that are supported by US universities will be kicked back to their country of origin after graduation. Their funding can be traced back to the government, such as NSF. It doesn't make sense to spend so much money to educate those people and then kick them to their hometown. The US should try to keep them in the US so that they can contribute further to the academic community or the industry.
