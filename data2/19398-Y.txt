As a nonimmigrant worker in the US. I support this proposal.

This policy can definitely make the US more attractive to top-level foreign students than other countries. And the history has shown that these students are very precious resources for the US to propagate its culture and belief to the world. This can benefit not only American economy but also its global strategy. As today's global geopolitical situation is so complicated. It's a wise choice to get young generation's support to maintain the authority of the US for international affairs and keep the peace between different countries.

This won't be a perfect policy. Someone will try to abuse it. The federal government can set a higher bar for the applicants. For example only give approvals for extension to the students with high GPA (Grade Point Average). Or require the applicants to provide references from professors or employers. By setting up some barriers for cheaters, this policy will work well in practice.
