Lisheng Hua I strongly support this expanding of training opportunities for the following reasons:

1. Good for US education. This extension of opt for STEM degrees, which is part of the studying experience of international students, would make studying STEM majors in US more attractive to talents around the world. Those talents would further contribute to the improvement of education quality as well as general technology.

2. Good for US economy. This extension gives small tech companies more choice while hiring among candidates from both US and abroad. 

3. Creating new job opportunities. The extension of opt would allow STEM students to stay longer in the US, which means more consumers and higher retail consumption.
