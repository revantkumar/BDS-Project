I highly support this rule. 

There are a large number of graduate students studying in USA every year. 
The best of them are great resources for USA to compete in the global market. 

STEM students are not competing with American citizens with low level jobs. 
Instead, STEM students generally work in a very highly skilled area, such as biologist or computer scientist. 
In these areas, USA needs these smart international young people to contribute to the future of this country. 

Furthermore, more and more international STEM students create jobs in USA. Some of them found startups. Some of them build connections between USA and their home countries. These elite young scholars play a critical role in USA's business and industry. They are trained in USA's graduate school, and USA should allow them to pay back by working and contributing in this country. 

In summary, STEM graduate students are utmost importance of USA's future. Please let them work at USA with OPT program extension.
