I definitely support and agree this rule.

The US attracts all kinds of talent people in the world. That is the most important reason why the US is the best and most competitive county in the world. If the talent student cannot stay in the US. They will come back to some other places, such as the UK. Then, the market and impact of the US will lose. Big tech company will stop their growing speed. Finally, the globe never rely on the American technology, finally more and more US citizen will lose their jobs.
