sailesh sai I strongly support the 24 months STEM extension because coming to US getting MS degree and find a job in a suitable field and gain enough experience in that field is my dream. To gain that experience I feel that 24 months extension will really help me.
International students like me show more interest towards pursuing these degrees in Science and Engineering. This shows that we are more interested in getting jobs in the STEM Areas. Most students come here for education and also for job opportunities. There are many talented people coming to US, as we can see that present CEOs of big organizations in US are from the other countries, were they helped those organization to do well and bring more income to the US economy and also at the same they created many opportunities for people is US. I really respect US for encouraging new talents from different countries and taking them forward, but if the extension is removed, the chances of getting a job is very difficult. This extension gives a fair chance to students to compete and find a job. International students work hard and retain the jobs because they have too much at stake. Even if the extension is to be removed, it cannot be done in such a hurry. There are about thousands of students who are already in the US and hoping to get a job. We are not ready for such a ruling, and this is really unfair to all of us since we made a life choice by coming to the US.
