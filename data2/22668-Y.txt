As a US citizen, I think OPT program abuse is unjust for the US public. However, I do believe that US should welcome talented foreign students from all over the world to make contributions to our nation while taking measures to prevent it being abused.

Therefore I suggest the following to improve the OPT program

1)Wage requirements for each major should be clearly set for employers who would like hire OPT students.

2)STEM OPT program should only be available for students who do study hard from good universities such as the top 100. The term "accredited Universities" is so vague that it may be abused easily.
