Jian Ren I agree with this plan, for several reasons:
1~ the extended 24 months is really important for students not only from foreign countries, but also precious for American students because students' professional skills can be honed perfectly during that extended time, and in this case we can make more contributions to industries. 

2~ It is especially precious for international students because there will be at least two or three times H1b draws for them, and this will increase the opportunity to be legally got a job in United States. Because the selection is a random event that many qualified students lost this opportunity every year, which is not a good news for improving the whole IT industry either. 

3~ there will be more chances for the undergraduate students to be prepared for applying the graduate schools, even though they are not selected by h1b draw, they still have chances to prepare for the next year.

4~ for the extended opt time, there will also be more opportunities for the non-STEM students because the competition about finding job will decrease, this to some extent is a win-win solution.
