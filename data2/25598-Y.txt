I believe that improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non immigrant students with STEM degrees enriches us all. and is one of the best ways to insure that America is seen as an inclusive democracy with the best professional training institutions in the world and thats why people come here for professional studies. This also enables their U S counterparts to be enriched by the international interactions that occur in professional settings..
