I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international student. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my degree in US, Australia, and German. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to many US companies since foreign STEM talents is a critical component of them.
