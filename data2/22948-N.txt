The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students and recent college graduates over Americans. This program has never been authorized by Congress and will reduce the jobs available for our young people. The foreign students who are hired are not paid the prevailing wage, so it amounts to corporate welfare for participating companies and their contribution to Social Security is much less than it would otherwise have been had they been employing American citizens. This Social Security shortfall is estimated at $1Billion per year. This hurts the young people and also those of us who are retired and living on Social Security.

WE ARE AGAINST THIS EXPANSION TO THE OPT PROGRAM.
