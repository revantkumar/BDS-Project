Timothy Roden I am so sad to see that many voices are saying no for this policy on the internet.

For those who suggest that we should close doors to new comers of this country, I hope they could get back to college and take their economics 101 course again. Freedom is not something like cheap slogans but the right, reasonable and smart way of life. 

We need the smartest internationals to come to this country for studying, working and staying. I know some of these people. They are your helpful colleagues and subordinates rather than just job competitors. If the native young graduates do not like these people, do not know how to cooperate with these people because you are trying hard to drive them out of this country, how could you expect them to be future leaders of global companies?

I strongly support this rule, not only for my colleagues and friends, but also for the future of this country.
