I strongly agree with this proposed rule. International students are making substantial contributions to U.S. economy. They are never a threat to U.S. employees! In the meantime, please stop the racist H1b and H4 contracting companies like Infosys, Tata CS, Cognizant from overtaking over American STEM, especially the sensitive IT industry. It is those illegal contracting companies who truly hurt U.S. labor market as well as the citizenship.
