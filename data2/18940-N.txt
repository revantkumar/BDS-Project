Why are Americans being denied equal rights? This makes no sense. Many students can't afford to go to college and foreigners are coming here and getting all kinds of assistance, getting things for free, and we citizens have to pay for it.

So many people are also without jobs because they are not finding jobs because foreigners who can't even understand or speak English are taking their jobs. 

Even if there is one in a million who speaks English, they are often hard to understand anyway and their behavior is often inappropriate to put it mildly.

Take care of our own citizens, the United States citizens, first and foremost.
