I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. International students provide diversity to not only everyday life but also academic prospective. American universities providing opportunities to International students to develop their own academic standard. The advance of science and technology always need fresh point. Without these international students, America would suffer from big scientific loss. Besides, driving away these students back to their hometown after graduation is just unreasonable and wasting of resources.

2.What's the purpose of education? To make a better society. To help students performing better in their job. To built a better functioning and more proficient country. An vital reason why America could be such strong and influential nowadays is that people from all over the world contributing their own strength to make this nation better. So some people, please don't be such myopic and take few seconds to think about how you could live in such prosperity. 

3. America always sets rigorous standard for international students. I think that's good. This could guarantee that people stay in America could bring benefit to the society - which is what Americans are looking for, and they won't "rob" native American's job opportunity. I assume that most people who are worried about people from outside are hardly competitive. They can't even win over a position against their countrymen. So work harder on yourself and make yourself better instead of complaining about international elite.
