Xiang Xu SUPPORT this rule with the following reasons.( 2nd comments from Xiang Xu )

1. US is always the best country for talented young people. This is because it has the best policy to encourage students to be creative and give them the same resources as its own citizens. Improving OPT ext rule is the strong support for this rule.

2. The potential startup company is founded when those students are still in college. If lots of them succeeds, then tens of thousand of job positions can be created and the government will also benefit from those companies.

3. The federal government and America citizens should realize that the real reason that thousands of job positions being stolen is the outsourcing companies. They take 1/3 of the H1b quota, which is originally designed for highly educated and high-skill people like STEM students. STEM OPT rule is not obeying the basic policy that attracting best people all over the world.
