Yuna Smith I support the proposal to Improve and Expand Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. This proposal will benefit US dramatically. Those STEM degrees international students are needed by a lot of high-tech companies in US. If you pay attention to students in STEM programs, a big part of them are international students. Domestic students can't satisfy the demand of those companies.

The claim that OPT extension will make the unemployment problem more severe is unreasonable. STEM degree students can only find jobs related to their areas. It's impossible that they are going to make people unemployed in all other areas.
