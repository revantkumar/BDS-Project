In a global economy setting, it's only wise for governments around the world to retain top notch talents from all over the world in order to keep leading the world in innovation, technology, infrastructure, manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. I whole-heartedlly support the new OPT expansion plan as this will only stimulate the US economy and help to keep its edge in almost all engineering and technological fields compared to the rest of the world. It's only foreseeable that the US is going to face even more competition for talents from rapidly-developing economies such as China, India and Europe. Thus attracting and retaining talents should have been the government's priority long ago and is way over due. Let's hope this new rule get passed as it should be and maintain the leading role that the US is playing in today's global economy. Let's draw lessons from the old Chinese government, Qing Dynasty, and refrain from locking up the 'borders' and shooing away talents from the rest of world who come to this country for what it represents that are freedom, justice and pursuit of personal success. Embrace foreign talents as they have always been making forward-driving impacts on all aspects of the American Civilization. Just think Albert Einstein, Tsung-Dao Lee, I.M. Pei, Steve Jobs, even Ellon Musk, these people were all immigrants and they had contributed greatly to making and shaping the USA that is today's undoubted global leader.
