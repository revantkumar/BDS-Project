Zhengdong Yu I strongly support this rule as this would attract more talented student with advanced degree stay in the U.S. As a Ph.D. candidate of computer science myself, I have seen many of friends with a Ph.D. degree who want to work here had to go back to their home countries because they cannot win the lottery to get the H1-B visa. And the chance is getting lower and lower each year.

A longer STEM OPT extension would allow those with Ph.D. degree to apply for H1-B multiple times so that they are more likely to stay here. Since the U.S government had already spend money training those people, why not let them stay?
