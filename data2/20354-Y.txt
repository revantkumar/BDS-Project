I strongly support extending the OPT up to 24 months with extra extension! First of all, this will continuously bring in more talents to boost the development of all fields in the states, especially for the science and technology field in the US. Secondly, more competition both in long term and short term will benefit the whole nation and even the world. Competition greatly push people to cultivate their potentials! Of course, there are more benefits of this new policy! I, again, strongly support this new policy!
