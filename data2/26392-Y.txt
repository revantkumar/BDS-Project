It seems a lot of comments are worrying about foreigner are taking citizens work. Thats a big mistake. On the contrary, they are creating more positions for US citizens. If foreigner are taking citizens STEM work, those American graduate students in STEM majors should be suffering to find a job. However, if you go to any graduate school, you will know thats not true. Almost every native STEM student gets a job, but there are still remaining positions. So what will those hi-tech companies do? They can either pay more money to recruit someone in the US, who is likely to be not adequate for the specific position. Or, they can open new oversea branches, and hire local people for less cost. If you are the CEO, you give me an answer which one you will choose? Moreover, if those foreigners are working in US, they will spend in this country too, that will be a big business and will actually creating more position for the citizens.
