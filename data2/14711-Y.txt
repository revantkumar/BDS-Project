Dear Sir or Madam,
It's very important to expand the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students With STEM Degrees for both the development of American industries and the career planning of the students themselves. With the expansion, students will have more chance to gain the engineering experiences and to learn how to apply the knowledge into industries. And in this way, the industries will benefit from the students as well. 
Therefore, please improve the training opportunities for all eligible F-1 students. Thanks

Yours,
Feng
