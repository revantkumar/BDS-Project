I strongly support the opt extension proposal for the following reasons:

1. Until now, the U.S. is still playing the leading role in science and technology field. One of the key reasons is that it attracts many international students coming to learn and also contribute their wisdom. Especially for STEM major graduates, they are mostly smart people and have a big contribution on innovation which will bring both profit and job opportunities to the U.S.

2. International STEM students who are able to find the jobs normally get much higher salary than minimum wage. Since the jobs that receive minimum wage are mostly not in STEM field.
