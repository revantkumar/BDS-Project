The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.

I oppose this. Let's get Americans jobs first less than 1 in 4 under 18 who wants jobs have one. Let's give these jobs to our highschoolers and those attending college. Most kids are helping out at home with expenses. Do not this to pass. Corporations need to stop oing to foreigners for cheaper labor. We need to do what is right for Americans for once.
