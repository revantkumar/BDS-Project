This is a really good decision because the students will have some breathing room to get themselves practical exposure on the courses they are graduated in. With the existing circumstances around H1b Visa, students will have more choices and better chances for firms accepting them, as the firms don't need to consider sponsoring visas for good amount of time. I really appreciate government doing this.
