Shihao L.V., University of Texas at Dallas I believe lengthening STEM Extension Period for OPT is very important for U.S.A's future. Every year, American employers spend lots of time training international students into valuable talents and those students keep contributing to this country greatly. If we can lengthen the extension period, the possibility of losing such talents for U.S.A would be decreased heavily. Since as an international student, I can feel the strong desire and passion to work in such a great country from most of my international alumni.
