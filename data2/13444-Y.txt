I strongly support STEM OPT extension. Firstly, this law will attract talented students all over the world to apply to study in US because they will have more time to practice what they've learned in the university. Considering most projects need at least two years to complete, the OPT extension will ensure students to finish their intern projects rather than leave in the middle way. This absolutely attracts students to apply to US to study. Secondly, US STEM will make faster progress with the contribution of the talents all over the world. It is a great loss for US that the university spend so much time and energy to train a STEM talented student, but US policy doesn't give him enough time to contribute what he learned to the US.
