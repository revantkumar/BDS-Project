I completely support the new 24-month OPT extension rule! 

This proposal truly shows that America is a country where everyone can have a chance to fight for their dreams, which is also the key reason why America is the strongest country in the world. I believe this proposal will further attract the best students all over the world to come to study in U.S., giving those talented students more time to gain practical experience and eventually contribute to American technology companies is undoubtedly a smart decision.
