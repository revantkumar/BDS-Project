This country is the United States of America. Our government is supposed to protect our citizens from all threats, both foreign and domestic. To me, that means economic threats as well. There are at least 15 million Americans out of work or working in low paying part time jobs making much less than they used to earn. The main responsibility of our government should be to these American citizens in promoting programs to help them regain jobs which have a future to them. Instead, it seems to me that the federal government is more interested in providing immigrants, both legal and illegal, with programs that cause even more American citizens to lose even more jobs, This is a disgrace as far as I am concerned and all those responsible for starting and implimenting such programs should lose their jobs!!! It is long past time to stop all illegals from entering this country and to reduce legal immigration in order to make sure that American citizens can regain what used to be the American Dream!!!
