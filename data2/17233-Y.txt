As a STEM major graduate student, I think the OPT extension is a win-win program. On the one side, the corporations, especially those high-tech company have highly demand for those highly self-motivated new grads with high technical skills. On the other hand. there are more than 40% of the Fortune 500 founded by immigrants, and there is an increasing number of immigrant entrepreneurs and innovators in the United States which can help to create more opportunity of employment for the United citizens. 24 months OPT extension is a good for the US corporations and decreasing the unemployment rate in the future.
