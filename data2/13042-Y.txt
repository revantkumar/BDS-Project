In the company I work in, one of most famous high tech company, we take months to hire a machine learning expert because a lot of people we interviewed are not qualified enough for the work. It seriously delays our working progress and waste a lot of time and money. Data scientists nowadays are too popular in the market, we need more STEM students, work hard and charge for a reasonable salary. I love their head down working styles and our business needs those technical backup.
