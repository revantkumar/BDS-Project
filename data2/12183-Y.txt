The extension will do good to the American economy.

Take Pittsburgh as an example.

First of all, the extension will make good to the grocery store. As more and more people will live in here and everyone needs to wear clothes, needs to buy foods, the grocery store will sell more products than before. In turn, it will make more profits from it. In that case, it will improve the salary of the employees and may hire more employees. Because of that, more job opportunities will be provided. According to the data given by the United States department of agriculture, Sales by the 20 largest food retailers totaled $449.3 billion in 2013, accounting for 63.8 percent of U.S. grocery store sales, an increase from 39.9 percent in 1993. That is undoubtedly because of more and more people lives in here.

Secondly, the extension will make good to the local real estate. As more and more people will live in here, the real estates will be scarce, in that case, the local American can increase the rent and make a lot of money from it. Besides, in order to favor the needs, more estates will be built and more and more people will be hired to build them. In that case, it can also help increase the job opportunities.

In all, i am in great favor of the extension.
