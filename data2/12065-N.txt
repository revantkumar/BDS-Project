On behalf of the millions of American citizens and legal immigrants who have been jobless caused by the ECONOMIC FAILURES of Obama, due to his socialistic and communistic system of government, where he has given the foreigners, including illegal aliens A GREAT favor of allowing them in coming to our country like "COMING INSIDE A GREAT ROOM", without any hesitation and prohibition, instead with a promise to grant them citizenship, jobs and employment, free housing and many more freeloading programs like the WELFARE. In short, we are OPPOSED to that proposal (Optional Practical Training), for so many obvious reasons that the American people knows them by heart.. Thank you very much.
