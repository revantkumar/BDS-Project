I welcome this new Rule for OPT Stem Extension for 2 years.This rule will benefit all the students and tech sector as well.US economy will boost because of this new rule, because of the skill training.US Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months. F-1 International students make a good part of US economy. So considering just a 12 month opt will definitely impact the number of students coming to US and ultimately impact US economy as a whole. H1B applications nare now above 200000 and the quota for MS Students is 21K and most of the Masters student did not get H1b this year. All the current students will go back to their country with the knowledge they gained by their education and US will be losing their talent and skills. More than 50000 students will have to leave US and we can just imagine the negative impact of this on the tech sector. If the rule is not implemented then US will be 20 years back in 5 years, with obsolete technologies/industry practices etc. and economy wild be badly affected. The thought of reducing the number of H1b and other visas should not allowed as it will affect US economy very badly.
