I think it's a good idea to have longer opt extension because smart foreigners can actually improve economy in USA. Foreign students work hard and get less pay. People may think foreigners take away lots of jobs and increase the unemployment rate of citizens, but it's a fair competition. More people compete for one job, higher the quality of workers. If USA decides to shut down the door, almost no students will want to study abroad, and many schools may close because they highly depend on tuition fees from foreigners. More people will lose their jobs. It's ok if American want to stay in comfort zone. I just personally think extending opt can profit both parties.
