Penny Granick This country is built upon a group of immigrants. It will be shameful if the government shut the door to those well-educated international graduates. These people come to America because they believe there is a growing market and expanding economy on this land, and even if it's not true, they will strive to make it happen. You can imagine what will happen to America in 20 years if you send these talents back into their own countries. We need these hard-working people to remind some of our "citizens" what kind of spirit has shaped the thriving of this country in the past 200 years.
