William Foster I am appalled at this idea. Why are we extending incentives to students whose parents do not pay taxes to the US? Once again this is a federal "Money is no object" program during a major depression within the US. Lets look at basic economics. This program as proposed generates low wage workers for US companies in this country. That is lower taxes for the government. And the end result is that low wages generates low consumption of goods. The same goods these companies are trying to sell. This benefits corporations for a short period of time but over time it generates the economy we are seeing today. 47 million people on food stamps. 194 million people out of work. I hear a lot about sustainable culture from the government...How about a sustainable economy?
