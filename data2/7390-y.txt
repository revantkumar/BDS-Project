Terence Bedinton I strongly support this new proposal.
STEM are extremely important for this country, we do not want these international students learn from our top faculty and server their countries or even build some super weapon against us. A SIGNIFICANT number of great mind in STEM majors are not born in US, Imagine we kicked them out at that time.
It is also ridiculous that most objectors are not even STEM major. They need to figure out who on earth rob their jobs.
