I fully support the proposed rule.
The world has never been working this way. People from different continents, speaking the same language, contribute to the one world, bearing the same goal. This is in America, and sometimes, it can only be in America. Top universities scattered around this nation and knowledge and wisdom is passed by from generation to generation. Technology companies spread across this nation and our life has been made better and easier day by day using their product and service. F-1 nonimmigrant students in STEM are part of them. Not only US citizens, not only STEM student, the world as a whole will also benefit from this. America is a place where all things are possible, right?
