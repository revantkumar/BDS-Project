Jianing Li I think the immigration policy is still in favor of American citizens. 
If a position can be filled by an American, it is not qualified to hire a foreigner. But if no Americans can handle the job or willing to do the job, we need to hire someone from outside to have the job done. Also the foreigners pay taxes, follow the laws. I don't understand why there are so many natives against them.
Remember, they are doing the jobs that Americans don't like to do or not able to do. They are not the reason of the high unemployment rate.
