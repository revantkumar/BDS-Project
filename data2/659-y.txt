Karol Brown I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. We need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S. Furthermore, as an immigration attorney, I know that many students seek to obtain an H-1B visa from their employers. This year, only 34% of all H-1B visa petitions filed in the short window were selected in the lottery. Foreign students should not be forced to return home because of our broken immigration system, and the failure of Congress to pass meaningful and much-needed immigration reform. 24 month OPT extension would at least allow foreign students to seek H-1B visas two times before being forced to return home.
