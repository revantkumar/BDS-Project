Shawn Gong I highly support this new rule and understand the concern of some US citizens. Here are some thoughts I want to share with those with open mind.

1. Hi-tech and other jobs as a whole are prioritized to US citizens. International students are considered only when there's short in US citizens.

2. OPT works as a buffer for international students to work in high tech job market, which accounts for only a small part in the whole job market.

3. International students introduce more competition and diversity. And both are good for innovation.

4. The bar is much higher for international students in job market. US keeps the best.

5. International students contribute to the economy no less than US citizens. As most of them come to US with a fresh new start, they create a new market for US citizens.

6. International students also pay taxes. There are many educational programs exclusively to US citizens, ranging from entry level to high level education. The funding comes from the taxes that international students contribute to. In a sense, international students pay the education/social security/health insurance that are only available to US citizens.
