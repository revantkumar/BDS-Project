I firmly support the new rule on OPT extension. The skilled immigrants have made huge contributions to the innovation and ground breaking research.They are not competing with US citizens for job opportunities, but contributing to the development of tech-innovation which will provide huge jobs in the long run. Forcing all the talented graduates to go back to their home countries after receiving the world best education is short-sighted. This kind of skilled workforce would be trustable taxpayers. Take a look at the STEM education in US, you can understand how US currently relying on the foreign workforces. 

Also this new rule will attract more international students seeking higher education in US. Please take a look the funding shortage in US universities, the universities here really need expensive tuitions paid by the international students.
