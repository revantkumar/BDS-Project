Rahul Pardeshi I appreciate the move by DHS to save the current OPT program. It will benefit the US economy and the IT sector and students too, as the students are hard working and contribute overall, while gaining precious experience. Students see US as a place where they make a 'Career' elsewhere in the world they make a 'living' by what they do. United States has always provided the opportunity to the best and that's why has always attracted the best talents. Hoping that this regulation get's passed in time to save the students and the IT sector from a catch 22 situation.
