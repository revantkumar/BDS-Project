Strongly SUPPORT the proposal. 

STEM students have made huge contributions to the USA. Lots of work in science/math areas are things Americans do not favor to do, but STEM students do. During these years, STEM students have made the most of their time in USA. Also, they did not rob or occupy Americans' job market. Competition is a natural thing and people who are the best fit for the positions will be in that place, thus it helps USA, as a diversified country, to keep the best people remain in its country and raise its production & innovation capability in the whole world. Moreover, almost all companies treat their stuff equal, no matter what visa they hold or what race they are in, so companies do not pay more to F-1 students than citizens if they are in the same position. Besides, this proposal is only for STEM students, not all F-1 students, so it's even more fair to all people in the job market. With all the good things, why not EXTEND training opportunities for STEM students?
