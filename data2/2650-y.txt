Siyi Ding This reform is positive both for US economy and international F1 students.

Firstly, it is good for US companies.
With the development of technology, IT companies need more and more employees trained in STEM majors. These students can satisfy the needs of IT companies.They can create a large amount of value to company. The communication between international employee and US employee can contribute more to company and the economy. With a longer OPT time, the firm have enough time to test the F1 employee's working ability, then they can decide whether to hire him for a long time. Company can assign a long project to a F1 employee without worrying about the work authorization issue.

Secondly, it is good for US economy.
When F1 students live and work in US, they need to rent house, buy groceries, travel, and consume. They increase the consumption of US which is good to US economy. If F1 students have long time to live in US, their parents and friends are more likely to come to US for traveling. They hope to ask F1 students to buy good in US as gifts. This reform will not only create consumption of the F1 student himself, but also the whole family behind the F1 students.

Thirdly, it is good for F1 students.
With a longer OPT time, they are more likely to be employed and more time to strength their work experience. It is good for F1 students career development.
