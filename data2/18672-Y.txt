I would like to oppose the OPT rule because due this rule it invites lot of fraud process in the system. It helps lot of Indian INC companies i.e. companies with CEO'S mainly Indians to find an illegal way to cheat the system and i would like to tell you how and what is happening currently with lot of OPT students at least to 60% of students that are being currently recruited and placed. Please read it and understand the cheating that's happening right now: 1. The consultancy recruits OPT students by a simple process without an interview either by cold calling or by referrals and almost every company has a guest house where students are being accommodated providing food and shelter for a short period of time until they gets placed(yes i am referring to placed because even though you are recruited by the company you will be never paid until you get a contract job with client - as OPT have a rule that they can be given unpaid training every consultancy says that it is legal);. Upto this there is no big fraud or cheating that happening with the system from next step everything is illegal, unethical and unlawful.2. In the meanwhile he will be asked what kind of technology he is interested in and the consultancy will give guidance as in which technology has good job market billing rate and how he can easily get a job, will the job be easy or hard with fake experience etc. so then according to the nature the consultant/student selects the technology and consultancy will give training to consultant form then. Note: Please understand that the term training that i referred is not exact training way they will give to consultants/students. The trainer teaches basic concepts in technology and will mainly train he/she to how to survive in the job with 8-10 years of fake experience and will assure consultants that he will be taking the phone interview call for the consultant/student and will also makes a deal that he will be providing job support during consultant job which is un
