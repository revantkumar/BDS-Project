It's becoming very apparent to me that President Obama is doing anything and everything possible to undermine the U.S. Economy. Misappropriated monies have been taken from the Social Security till and all of this diminishes the funding that was to be dedicated to payments (retirement insurance, not entitlement) to millions of elderly that have worked hard for and payed in on along with the matching payments by their employers. These sort of actions without approval of Congress must be stopped, and previous Executive Actions should be undone, as they were Unconstitutional.
