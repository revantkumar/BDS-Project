Siva sai karthik Kesanakurthi I like the newrule for OPT STEM Extension for 24 months. It helps several students inmany ways. If the DSO rule can be loosened or kind of exempted, then i will definitely support this rule. I support the proposed 24 month extension rule also by keeping the other good things in mind.
