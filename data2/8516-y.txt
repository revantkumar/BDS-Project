Anonymous Hi,
STEM extension is beneficial for both - foreign nationals as well as USA. It is important to retain foreign nationals who are highly trained in STEM to maximize gains for tech employers and in consequence, the US government. 

I also feel that the argument which says foreign nationals are depleting local jobs is specific to overseas nationals who are directly being flown in from across the world without having a first hand study-experience from a US university.

However as a student (irrespective of my nationality) who has invested heavily in educating and training myself from one of the best Electrical Engineering universities in USA, I must have a fair shot at gaining world class industry experience and giving back to USA and the industry which has made this education possible.
***Note : If I pay as much as the local sitting next to me to procure my meal in a restaurant, I should not be denied my meal just because I am not a local. ...........Same analogy applies to US STEM. :)
Thanks
