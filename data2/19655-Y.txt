First, I will say I support this rule and this country needs smart people.
if you look at all the negative comments here you will be amazed how xenophobic these people are.
Majority of people's concern is that international students will put Americans out of jobs, which I totally understand that, but I argue that in fact, the reality for foreign stem students is hard and finding a job from a tech company that is e-verify and can also provide sponsorship is even HARDER. There are simply not that many of companies out there willing to take international stem students. For example, most of the mechanical or aerospace or satellite related jobs will require candidate to have citizenship or at least green cards. Company that provide sponsorship will have to hire additional lawyer for foreigners . Thus hiring a foreigner actually cost more. Another thing is that, unless a foreign students can secure a job offer within 30 days after the graduation, they have to leave the country or change their visa status, and they are only allowed to find a job that is related to what they study. A lot of foreign students are on loans and thousands of miles away from home and no family no connections here in the States. All those facts I described above make those students way harder than an American born students.
Life is not easy at all and finding a job IS NOT A EASY THING LIKE MOST OF THE AMERICANS THINK IT WOULD BE. And now is time for American stem students to compete on a higher level.
