I own an IT support company. You can't swing a dead cat on Craigslist without finding two things:

1) Americans with impeccable IT resumes willing to work for $15 an hour.

2) Countless Indian and Pakistani H1-B Visa workers competing with them for a job.

Even though I stand to profit from this outrage, it disgusts me that the US government is throwing American citizens out of work for the benefit of the rich and the benefit of foreigners.

I would never allow one of my kids to study technology in college. The government proves every day that it will punish them for doing so.
