I support this policy.

Talented international students have been one of the sources of U.S. fastest growth and countries who refuse to embrace talents, skills, and beneficial competition have been experiencing much slower growth.

STEM international students are NOT as described as cheap labor or using U.S. funds. Remember this is the "STEM" area were talking about and as long as theyre hired the SALARY is way ABOVE average salary level in the U.S.

The extension is ONLY for STEM students, NOT ALL INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS.
