Ragibul Huq I really appreciate this approach. I have finished school almost two years back and been working for a engine manufacturer for the whole time. I personally did not have to go through the OPT extension process as my company processed my H1-B even before i graduate from my school. But after spending couple of year in regular workforce i realized that all these freshly hired STEM graduate are one of the strongest force in these engineering based organization. More than 30% of these recruits are non american hence they are staying here in h1, f1 visa. But now a days due to large number of applicant the chances of getting H1B visa in the first chance are less than 50%. So extending the length of OPT period will increase the chance of keeping all these freshly recruited in the company and will give them appropriate time to apply for proper job visa. Thanks a lot for highlighted this issue and bring to everyone's attention.
