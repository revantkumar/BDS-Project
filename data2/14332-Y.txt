I support the OPT extension proposal for the following three reasons:

1) OPT extension is hugely beneficial to US companies
One can imagine so many reasons not to hire foreign students: they are not native speakers so they often cannot communicate as effectively; they did not grow up in the US and therefore might not be the best cultural fit; many of them would leave the country after a couple of years either voluntarily or due to visa issues and therefore companies run the risk of wasting resources to train them; there is substantial cost to sponsor H1B to keep students on OPT as long term employees. The list goes on. Yet the very best companies do still hire them. If we trust companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon to make hiring decisions in their own best interests, we have to believe that either STEM foreign students are a significant assets to those companies or there is significant shortage of local talents that all the additional costs to hire foreign students are well worth it. In either case, it seems to be in the best interests of US companies that the government to act to guarantee continued access to foreign talents to maintain their global competitiveness.

2) OPT extension is critical to STEM education and financially beneficial to US universities
Complementing theory with practice is a central piece of US STEM education. Expanding the practical training experience through OPT extension confers a superior advantage to US universities in attracting the very best foreign students. One would only have to survey international contests in STEM fields such as computer science to notice that foreign STEM students are a significant force to maintaining the global competitiveness of US universities. Moreover, private and public universities throughout the country are already enjoying enormous financial gains in recruiting foreign students to fill up their STEM classrooms. Annulling OPT extension would significantly weaken the appeal of a US STEM educati
