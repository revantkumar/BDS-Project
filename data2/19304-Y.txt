I strongly agree that the new rule proposed regarding expanding time period for Stem Extension to 24 months is fair and is in favor of technological advancements and better economy of US. It will not only benefit international student to get fair amount of time to showcase his talent for the betterment and progress but will also lead to a better economy of the country. I would strongly favor to increase the timeline to 24 months.

GOD BLESS AMERICA
