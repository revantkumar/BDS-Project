While I support increasing the OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months, I think the requirements of "Mentoring and Training Plan" will make it very difficult for OPT students to be employed especially at small or start-up companies. With the exception of big corporations who have lawyers specialized in immigration, most companies will not employ a foreign student if they have to make many legal commitments that can cause them trouble later. It's should be easier with OPT than H1B, not harder.
