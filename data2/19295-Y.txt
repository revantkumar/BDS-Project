Support this change. Thumbs up! As a former F-1 student, I know the importance of increasing the cap to 24 months. There were many talented students who was forced to leave US not because they don't have the ability to make contribution to US but only because of the limit quantity of H1B per year. Generally speaking, those students who possess STEM degree are highly educated and capable of doing great work by applying their knowledge to daily work. It is a great loss if those students cannot stay in US just because they cannot get the H1B.
