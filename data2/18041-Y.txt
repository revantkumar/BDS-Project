I support this rule as a US citizen. For those who think STEM students will take away our jobs I want to say you are wrong. In short term probably yes, but if this rule doesn't pass through, who else will come to US to study? One of my relatives from England told me the h1 visa lottery is only 33%. This rule can keep the most competitive students here in the US and benefit in US economy in the long run.
