We learned a lot from American colleges. After graduation, we do our jobs even better than many Anericans. I understand many jobs will be taken by international students, but in the same time, we create better companies by working hard. Better companies will greatly enrich the employment situation in the US. As an international student, I want to learn more through OPT and then go back to my country. The time in between will create so much profit for American economy. Hope we can get the extended OPT so that we can make this even better.
