I support.

US invites so many STEM students to US to get higher-education degree, and many of them for free with financial support . US actually is doing an investment because most of benefits can only be harvested in the next few years after graduation. Then after graduation, US said you immediately get out of here and contribute whatever you learn to other countries.

Many Americans think this reduces their job opportunities so they don't like OPT. Well, they think in a wrong way, why? Because even if this is true and US do not like this effect, they should abandon their current policy in enrolling international students instead of the policy after their graduation. Because after graduation, the investment cost is already put there, the game is already started and now in the middle, without a good working policy, most of cost cannot be converted to benefit in the end.
