I think that STEM extension rule is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. There are not enough STEM graduates in United States hence it's 
a brilliant idea to introduce STEM extension for foreign students. This will ensure continuous supply of young talented STEM graduates and promote growth of science and technology. I wholeheartedly support this new rule.
