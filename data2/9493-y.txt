Ruocun Wang I'm a PhD student in the US originally from China. I want to support the idea of expanding training opportunities for STEM degrees so that my friends can have more opportunities to stay as well as myself. It's beneficial to the US because it brings a stream of stable and fundamental workforce to the industries in the US which is essential for the transformation towards Industry 4.0.
