Sam Jefferies I definitely SUPPORT OPT EXTENSION. This rule gives students more chances to apply their knowledge in real-world setting and will eventually promote the advancement of scientific research and technology. 

So who would say they want to stop the development of science and technology? It's irrational and ridiculous to stop an obviously beneficial rule due to the myopia and greed of individuals. Most of the negative comments could not correctly related the causal relationship between the unemployment of some Americans and the fact that they are not capable enough to handle those positions. There is no reason for a U.S. citizen graduating from a top university with top grades end up finding no jobs. Likewise, it is unfair to exclude the opportunities for hard-working international students from top university with remarkable academic achievements to make contribution to our society through their knowledge.

In fact, most of the negative comments are illogical and do not make sense. They just blame their failure or misery on others or on the government. This can to some extent explain why some of these workers are not able to get hired. And those high-tech jobs are definitely not belong to these people. So even there is no OPT extension, chances are that these people still could not get satisfying jobs.
