Kai Ni I strongly agree for the rule to be passed. As far as I know, most of OPT jobs are high- tech jobs and they need smart foreign students in every area. Based on the spirit of American, every one should have equal job seeking opportunity in USA. However, the students with OPT already have many obstacles in job seeking given their requirement for sponsorship, we should give them more pressure if they are qualified with a high tech degree. USA is a open market country and we should let the market decides the people who can stay here or going back to their own country rather than the government's rule.
