Anonymous Anonymous I strongly support the extension. Here are my reasons for the support:

Most students come here for education mostly because of job opportunities. If the extension is removed, the chances of getting a job reduce significantly. This will simply lead to students not coming to the US for study.

Various universities that rely on large tuition collection from foreign nationals will lose a major source of revenue. Not to mention billions-dollars economy that relies on international students renting houses, cars, travel, shopping, phones, buying cars, tourism economy when parents and relatives visit America.

Unites Stated is currently facing STEM workforce shortage. This is just a fact. Companies like Facebook, Google hire international students not because they are cheaper labor force, but because US workers do not prefer to obtain a Graduate degree (MS/Ph.D.) in these areas.

In the end, I just want to say that, US economy is built on fair competition. This extension gives a fair chance to students to compete and find a job. International students work hard and retain the jobs because they have too much at stake. They have proven to be great workers and an asset to many companies all across the US.
