I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal, as a current international student, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S, ortherwise U.S government would loss more. We are not the threat for the U.S citizens, the work position we seek are the position that native citizen who don't want to work, if the international student cannot get the legal right to work here, who could fill these blanks?
