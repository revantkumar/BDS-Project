I absolutely SUPPORT this proposal, other than my personal benefits from it, here are several reasons I consider it to be beneficial to the whole U.S.:

1. My major is in computer science, as we all know, the top companies of almost all areas in CS are from US, and they are currently employing a lot of internationals. If this proposal is declined, many top-tier students will be less likely to consider U.S. as a place in their next step, which would definitely weaken the overall strength of companies in U.S. and strengthen their original countries (assume they come back home to find a job).

2. My impression of U.S. has always been a great immigration country trying to absorb people with top skills from all over the world. I think this is one of the reasons why U.S. is the most wealthy country in the world. This proposal, if passed, is continuing on this track.

3. From what I observe, most STEM major students are highly educated and with top-skills, they are going to bring wealth, rather than trouble to the whole country. Which will benefit all the people in the long term.

Therefore, I don't see any reason to object this proposal. I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposal!
