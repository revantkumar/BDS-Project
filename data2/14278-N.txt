The President going to do as damage as he possibly can before he has to leave office. The H1-B Visa shows how much he hates America. The Customs Enforce Bureau is a joke. 
The Moslems have said they hate Americans and wants to kill them, and yet, we're bringing them over here. The Christians have been ask to back off our believes so not to offend them. This is suppose to be our country, make them back off there believes, hating and killing Americans. I believe Christians should be louder than ever before. Our President said he is a Christian and yet, he wants us to be silent while he allows the Mexicans cross the boarder illegally and now given them the right to stay. 
Immigration has a legal way of getting in America. Homeland Security needs to be reminded where home really is. I'll give them a hint. USA.
