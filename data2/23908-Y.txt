I strongly support this rules that it deliver respect and equal.
American's spirit is everyone has equal right to work. It's sad that hard working international student can't have enough time to continue looking for job or working as a employee in US commpany because of failing on H1B petition lottery and running out of OPT. Forcing talented student to leave US will heavily disturb the US economy, eventually jeopardize US people's benefit. 
Let's do this in wise way.
