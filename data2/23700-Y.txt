It is more and more difficult for international students to find jobs in the US market. It's certain that US citizens and green card holders do have priorities when companies consider candidates. But eventually what determines whether you can get the offer or not is your qualifications not your immigration status. Being a citizen is beneficial but it does not guarantee you can get the job. I think a better thing to do is thinking about how to improve yourself instead of just blaming the society. A well qualified person will be welcome everywhere.
