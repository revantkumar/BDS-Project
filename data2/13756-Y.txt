Discontinuing F1/OPT will be a disaster not only to America's talent pool but also to the education system, where billions of income have been contributed by international students. Countries in Europe and Australia could have replaced our advantage in attracting foreign students and offering them opportunities to work in the STEM fields, for which we could lose billions of revenues in schools, business, real estate, etc. Once the cycle of foreign talents, funds and money leaving America has formed, more permanent jobs could have lost as compared to temporary OPT roles.
