I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. US government has invested a lot in supporting and developing STEM education. If we don't have the proposed rule, many talented students majoring in STEM have to leave US after graduation. It would be a great loss and pity that all the efforts made in education cannot be transformed to research progress and economic growth.
2. As a PhD student majoring in Computer Science, I know a lot of experts/professors who are not native Americans. A lot of breakthroughs in science and research would not come true without the help from the OPT program.
3. Native Americans have nothing to worry about. Foreign workers usually have the same salary levels as the Americans since most companies are equal opportunity employers. Companies are not charities, they are always looking for the most talented people for the right position. Having a US citizenship is not the only reason that a company should hire you, especially in high-tech industry. In fact, Americans have much more opportunities than international student in job-hunting. International students and the OPT program should NOT be blamed for taking away job opportunities from American workers.
