I am against the rule that employers should report to the DSO any STEM OPT student who terminated or departed within forty-eight (48) hours after the F-1 student has left employment.

This requires the employers babysit the international students since only 48 hours are allowed for the report. Employers are required to provide training but should not be required to monitor the activity of international students so frequently. Instead, this time should be lengthened to at least a week.
