This proposal definitely has a positive effect both for immigrants and American's economy. I strongly SUPPORT it because I believe STEM students is one of the most important reasons which makes USA the most powerful country in the world. 

To stand in the frontline of scientific research and global market, a country should embrace the best scientists and engineers from all around the world. This is not a move which might harm the benefits of local Americans. In fact, the stimulation of economy which leads by the growth of high-tech area will help the country create more jobs and become more prosperous. STEM students are not taking jobs from local Americans. They are helping this country create more jobs for everyone.
