I strongly support this extension. As far as I can see, there are many a companies relying on the STEM students as the potential technician. However, not all of the companies have the abilities to support a H1B for the students. Since those STEM students are mostly considered as the brightest guys across the world, it is really a pity to let them go. Especially for startups, they need those clever elites however they many not sponsor many of them. While our USA has a reputation for entrepreneur spirits, it is a shame to miss those students. I hope more of them could help the industry grow better and all the country can benefit from the boom.
