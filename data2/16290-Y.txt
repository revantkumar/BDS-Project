I strongly agree to the OPT extension time for the following reasons:

First, the STEM field is in need of new eligible workers, which has already been reported in many occasions.

Second, even with the extension, the time that F-1 students train themselves is still limited (up to few years). The time is not long enough for them to develop into a full career, however, after proper training(s), they will be more competitive to ensure them to land good jobs in their home country. 

Last point, it is for the national interest to attract more talented people to study here, rather than pushing them away.
