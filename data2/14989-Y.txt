I strongly support this proposal since I believe qualified and talented international students who completed their study in a U.S. university deserve a fair opportunity to practice their skills anywhere including a U.S. company. Every single one of them are working extremely hard in school and workplace with great determination and motivation to earn this opportunity, usually harder than their US counterpart. Having such vibrant workforce is healthy for this nation's economy, as being proved by so many examples especially the IT industry. If we turn them away simply based on their nationality, it will definitely have disastrous effect on the competitiveness of US company and economy. 

Someone opposes this proposal citing competition. Since when Americans are so afraid of competition that they have to be nursed by their government? If a US citizen is more or equally qualified than a foreign student, there is no reason for the employer to choose foreign student over a citizen, as hiring a foreigner may have to overcome many extra difficulties than a citizen. If someone is simply less qualified and want a safety net to get hired anyway, maybe one should go to a foreign country since this is not what America is about.
