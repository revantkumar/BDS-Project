Your immigration policies have allowed lower level jobs to have more competition (lower wages). Remember Supply and Demand, the more Supply you have the lower the value. And now you want to create more competition at the higher levels. Someone needs to teach basic math and basic economics to the Democrats. Oh, and I forgot about our debt. Has it hit $20 Trillion yet? Thanks,
