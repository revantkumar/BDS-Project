Wes Nuttall I have an uncle unemployed and two that are grossly underpaid because the job market is flooded with immigrants willing to work for very little! Their families are suffering from the consequences of the policies from the past years! It just doesn't make sense to allow more workers in when we have so many qualified workers unemployed or underemployed! I think we need to stop all visas until every American is working and making a decent wage! It just makes me sad that it seems like our own government is trying to keep America struggling! :-(
