Rebecca Wu Stem students are the ones with degrees that will contribute to the U.S. economy most directly. Developing economy is about providing the best to the seciety, so giving the F-1 student an equal opportunity to compete for a job will increase the chance that the talent who get hired is the most competitive person. So I strongly agree with this proposal and hope that this could be passed soon.
