I disagree with the proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program. It would negatively impact American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. Allowing U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens is artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. This results in lower wages for all tech workers. Another issue is that the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
