Xincheng Tang I strongly support this decision. Based on my personal experience, many students came to us for study, pursue their dreams and opportunities because USA has the best school system which could attract most talented people in the world. Some of the students started their own companies and creating jobs for US people. All this will depend on whether we international students are given the enough time and chances to stay. America has the traditional to attract best people because the open-minded, friendly immigration policy. All hard-working people should be given equal chances to work.My support document will be one research conducted in 2011. The research finds that 48 percent, or 24 out of 50, of the top venture-funded companies had at least one immigrant founder. And on average, they can create 150 jobs!
