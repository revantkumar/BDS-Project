I strongly support the OPT extension. This opportunity gives international students more time to have better experience in the most industrialized country. It is also good to US economy to have talented foreign people work in high-tech area. In addition, longer OPT is beneficial to universities to attract talented students from the world to contribute to scientific research. Thus, I think OPT extension should be supported.
