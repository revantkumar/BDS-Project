I fully support this proposed rule regarding improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Student with STEM degree. I, myself, is a F1 student working under OPT. I'm working legally, paying tax and contributing to the US as much as a U.S citizen does. 
In order to improve the quality of foreign-born employee, I recommend the application for extension should be supported by a salary report provided by employers. Based on this report, exploitation of foreign workers and employment of under-qualified employees could be controlled more efficiently. 

Best regards,
