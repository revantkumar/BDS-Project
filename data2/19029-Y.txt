I fully support to this great rule. As an international student majored in computer science, we do need a longer period of time to complete an entire project. Also, many excellent international students in computer science are attracted by expanding their training opportunities. As everyone knows, those international students already play very important roles in many U.S. Internet companies, e.g. Google, Facebook, Linkedin, Microsoft, etc. More excellent F-1 students can actually provide more powerful input for these companies, which is definitely beneficial for United States.
