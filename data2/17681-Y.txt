it would be a stupid decision to shut those well educated foreign students who spend their best time in the U.S. out of the door. We spend our best time in life on the U.S. university campus and look forward to use our skill on the land where we are educated. If the door is shut American firms can't hire as many more skillful workers and have to compromise their productivity to American Conservatism.
