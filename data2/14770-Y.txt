As a matter of fact, many PhD students studying in U.S. are international students. They need to spend countless hours and efforts to finish their degrees, which are at least 5 years for the most cases. If they only have one year OPT without extension, the possibility of getting adequate practical training would plunge. Then many international students may choose not to come to US for studying any more. This would cause very serious loss to universities both financially and academically. No body would want to see that.
