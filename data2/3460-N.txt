Hello,
I read about this recently in the paper and I do not think this is proper or that it has anything at all to do with Homeland Security. From what I understand this program was originally used to give these students some help for when they returned to their own country. Now it is being used as a way to allow these students to stay even longer. We have plenty of American citizens and permanent residents that there is no reason to allow much less benefit companies for hiring F-1 students.

I thoroughly agree with John Miano, the attorney representing tech workers who wrote "the proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination." "The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit."

I am sick and tired of the United States Government having so many programs to benefit everyone but American citizens. This proposal does not help this country and should not take effect.

Shame on Homeland Security for 
1. Hurting American college students
2. Helping companies to hurt college graduates
3. Giving preference to foreign students over Americans

How do you people sleep at night?

Stop lifting up other countries stepping on of our own citizens.
