Hi I'm Sharen Rayburn. I extremely urge you to vote against this bill. Why can't you and corporate America see who is going to be left to actually spend money and boost our economy. This is just good Ole cut your nose off to spite your face! Short term you may be boosting stock holdings but the long term effect is the money circulation will dry up. Please use common sense. 

Respectfully, Sharen Rayburn
