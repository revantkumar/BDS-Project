This is a great proposal. As we know, many technical workers in U.S. are foreigners. They studied in U.S. and then worked here. In Silicon Valley, in New York, in Seattle, many engineers are not Americans. With this proposal, the F-1 students can work here to help technical companies make more profit and boost the economy. All in all, this proposal will be a further boost to the economy.
