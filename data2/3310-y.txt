Yaokai Jiang Having worked at a medium-sized tech company for the past 4 years has revealed one thing to me: Hiring a qualified tech worker is extreme difficult. Many of our new engineers come from college directly and given the proportion of foreign students in STEM programs, if we were to suddenly exclude a large number of them because of elimination of STEM extension, the talent pool will drastically shrink. There simply aren't enough qualified candidates if we exclude foreign students. It's not about a company's willingness to pay top dollars either, because the pool is only so big, everyone hired by us will be one less that can be hired by another tech company. Which is why I think hinderance to the OPT extension program will directly impact competitiveness of the entire American tech industry.
