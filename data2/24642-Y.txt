I strongly support this new rule as the following reasons.

First of all, foreign students with OPT will not take up the work opportunities for American because STEM work opportunities give priority to American

Secondly, high tech companies creates opportunities for other industries. For example, Uber creates opportunities for drivers. OPT students are essential for High tech companies since High tech companies usually can't employ enough engineers from native citizens.
