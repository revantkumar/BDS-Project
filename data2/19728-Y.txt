I strongly support this OPT-EXENTION program since it benefits for both international students who are currently working in US and the development of economy of US.
As we all known, in recent decades, international students especially STEM international students contributes a lot to US, they are active in different kinds of companies.
US is one of the most powerful country in the world for some reasons, one is that this country would like to embrace the different culture and different opinions which bring creativity, energy and inspiration. Thus, a lot of well-educated and talented people come to United Sates to look for their America dream. 
Considering that thousands and hundreds companies have international employees, it will cause loss to this company if a lot of their international employees have to leave and go back to their country just because of their OPT has run out.
Nowadays, some domestic people think that international students take the job opportunity away from them. In my point of view, we all live in a world which full of competition, sometimes it is the competition makes people work harder and stimulates people improve themselves. International students shouldnt be blamed just because they are more competitive.
