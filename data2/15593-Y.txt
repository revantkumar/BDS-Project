Absolutely this rule could benefits the America.
In fact, there are so many work chances in America as this is the most developed and wealthy country in the world. Any American who try to study hard must have a satisfied job. Compared with so many work chances, the amount of American younger are less. International students can fill this apart of vacant positions. Only the brilliant F-1 students could get the job, and they can do more for the industry and society of USA with their knowledge if they have longer time to work here. One country wants to develop with a high speed couldn't let those people who has ability go. Now many corporations have a lot employees who are international students and in the OPT period. Many of them couldn't have the chance in the first year to get the H1B. Then if the OPT time is only one year, what they could do is just leave America. It will really destroy the turnover of those organizations.
Extending the period could make more international students have more time to contribute to American corporations and American development. It will set a stable turnover and a virtuous circle. And it can even promote American students to stud harder and work harder.
