I cannot believe that my Representatives who are supposed to represent the people of the State Of Oklahoma and the people of the United States as a whole would see fit to give jobs to foreign students instead of the Citizens of this country first. I think WE are the only country in this world to look out for foreigners first,then their own citizens,maybe.
IF WHOSE EVER BRIGHT IDEA THIS WAS REALLY NEEDS TO RE-THINK IT,BECAUSE THAT IS WRONG ON SO MANY LEVELS!!
