I strongly support the new OPT extension rule.

International students are making huge contributions to our country, and they are bringing a huge amount of money to many companies in the U.S. According to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf), immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010. International students are especially important for many scientific and technology companies, as those companies hire the most international students. STEM are fields critical for the US in order to continue its leadership in the world. Getting an h1b visa becomes more and more competitive each year, and the OPT extension provides opportunities for h1b candidates to continue to work in the U.S. before they can obtain an h1b visa. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people.
