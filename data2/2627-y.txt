Nishigandha Sonavane I am supporting this law regarding STEM extension. I think STEM extension is a good way to allow international students to get more work experience in USA and improve themselves. This will attract more international students in USA, which will benefit the US economy hugely. This extension is for limited period of time and thus this law won't increase immigrants in USA.
