The United States is a multi-ethnic, diversified country, that's why it could be the leading country in the world. I can't believe that so many Americans are so rude and annoyed to prevent this rule. 
The US government and colleges offered the fellowship or scholarship to attract the best students from other countries to learn the latest high technology, and most of the students perform well. Then they just go back to their own countries to help develop and improve their countries. The governments of their countries will be so glad to thanks the US trained the talents without any cost.
