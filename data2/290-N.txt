My husband and I are currently paying over $60,000 a year for our STEM-focused daughter to get an engineering degree from the University of Notre Dame. Given the reality that the Optional Practical Training Program has denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013, that sizable investment of our family's resources could be wasted if she cannot find a job in the STEM industry because the U.S. Government is encouraging companies to take foreign students over American citizens.

Despite the original purpose of OPT to help foreign students when they return to their HOME countries, this program is directly and NEGATIVELY effecting the job prospects of American workers because employers have financial incentives to hire foreign students, undermining job opportunities for American STEM workers.

The OPT program also removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds at a time when our government cannot pay its own bills and has run up over $18 trillion in national debt. The Obama administration attempted to bypass the public process because it does not want Americans to know that DHS is seeking to expand a program that would not only take STEM jobs away from Americans, but also endanger our national security since the Government Accountability Office said that "ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under OPT are maintaining their legal status in the United States."

This program -- which was intended to be temporary -- needs to be stopped. Put Americans first.

Sincerely,

Molly A. Kraker
