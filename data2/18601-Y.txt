This is a really great policy. I strongly agree with it. Many international students are excellent in their major. If they are given opportunities to work in US, they can definitely contribute to the US economy and industry. And also, this absolutely can not take away native Americans' jobs, instead, it will encourage native people to study hard to compete for jobs and improve all people's ability in their majors. Competition makes people stronger. In conclusion, this policy is not only beneficial to US economy, but also native Americans.
