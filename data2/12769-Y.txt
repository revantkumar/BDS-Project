As a citizen of the USA since birth, I 100% support immigrant students and trust we will make it easier for them to extend their visas after they graduate to stay and work in the U.S.
I also support improving and expanding opportunities for non-immagrant students with STEM degrees and CapGap Relief and for all eligible F-1 students.
Let's give youth a chance and our country, a better future!
