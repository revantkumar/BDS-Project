Hongyi Wang I have read lots of comments here, both agreed and opposed. 
Opponents point out that this will hurt American workers in related fields. What I want to say is firstly it is very difficult for an international students find a job in a company that is E-Verified who are qualified to hire people on STEM OPT. I believe America has many individuals facing the difficulties to find a job but I also know that some companies are really in lack of workers they need. E-Verify is a very good program to protect local workers while solve such companies's shortage of workers.

Secondly, even though international students are so lucky to find a job at an E-Verified company, it doesn't mean this company are willing to support H1B for the student. Only 65000 students can be granted H1B to work at US after the OPT period and they must be very talented. America doesn't need cheap labors but she does need talented individuals. I think STEM OPT + H1B lottery is the best way to pick those talents from tens of thousands of international students. 

65000 is a really really small number that hardly harms the local workers. But it does give many companies the opportunity to grow faster and be more competitive and help US economy. Most importantly, it gives US a chance to build academic or business miracles from this number of innovative seeds. Please give some forgiveness to these 65000 students.
