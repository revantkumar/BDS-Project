When labor unions protest a Democrat Presidents program over Federal law then it seems logical to me that American Workers and American Students are not going to benefit.

Someone show me another country with existing laws and regulations on immigration which are more liberal than the United States Law already is. It is quite obvious that Mr Obama's priorities are coordinated to break the United States completely.
