Time to stop this and start hiring American college students .Big company's should be ashamed to hire these people over our own at 1/3 the labor cost . Great for profits, bad for US student loans . Who gets to pay those off ? The tax payer sorry we're kind of strapped. Use a little common sense and remember your own people.
