Lei Zhao, Duquesne University The F 1 students with STEM degrees play a significant role of making the U.S. A better place!
1. The F 1 students with STEM degrees are well-educated, they will use their knowledge, technics, thoughts and behaviors to make the U.S. stronger.
2. The F 1 students with STEM degrees will make the U.S. more competitive. 
3. The F 1 students with STEM degrees are all young. The young generations are the hope of the world. 
4. The F 1 students with STEM degrees will expand domestic demand and competitiveness.
5. The F 1 students with STEM degrees will the make relationships of their countries and the U.S. better.
6. Those who oppose the expanding the training opportunities for F 1 students with STEM degrees are just afraid of competitions. However, the reasons why the U.S. is the most powerful country in the world is because the U.S. is the most competitive country in the world!
7. Organizations which hire F 1 students with STEM degrees will lost a lot if their employees leave their job. Those companies spend time and money traning those students as their employees, but most of those students will go back to their countries. The sooner the worse!

We are F 1 nonimmigrant student. We are loving the U.S. but we also love our own countries. We just want to get more tranings in the U.S., and one day we'll go back to our countries. Make our countries and the world a better place!
