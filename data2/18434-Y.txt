OPT extension is a really important opportunity for foreign students who are currently pursuing their degrees at United STates. I strongly support this proposal as follows:
1. Students who graduated from universities should have the chance to display their talents, which can both benefit the companies and industry as well. They can keep contributing and they will learn the practical experience which can be helpful for the future careers.
2. Although this will affect the opportunities of local students, it is still a good way because competition can improve the skills and abilities for not only the foreign students, but also for local students. They will be aware of the potential pressure and keep improving themselves.
