I strongly support the new Opt extension rules. The past decade has witnessed an exploded developing of the technology industry. I believe the Opt Extension rules can bring more foreign talents to the US.
International students help the US colleges work through the economic crisis. They rent houses and spending in the US which are also good for the economy. 
Someone may argue me like this, International students brings competitions. They could take the positions that belong to native. There is no such problem because the situation in STEM industry is not the same as the traditional industry. The US doesn't have that many graduate students to do the entry level works. Furthermore, the developing of high-tech industry can bring more opportunities for other fields, for example, health care and banking.
Last but not least, the developing can bring more opportunities for the US and the talent students from all over the world bring developing to the US.
