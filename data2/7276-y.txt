Ibrahim Urooj Saeed I support this proposed Rule by DHS. In any technical job, such as software development, it is really hard to gain meaningful experience in just a years time. This is because, especially in large corporation, a true software development lifecycle takes a long time and the development of an employee similarly takes a long time. STEM field jobs are not easy, and they take a long time for an employee to be good at them. This rule would successfully give a STEM worker appropriate experience before they return to their home countries or continue with further education. 

Many employers have training programs for right out of college workers, but this rule would push those employers who do not to have training programs to have them as well.
