Wenchen Tu I highly support STEM OPT Extension for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students for the following reasons.

First of all, one of the reasons I choose to go to America for my graduate study is the STEM OPT Extension. OPT Extension gives me more time to apply what I learned in graduate school into work and polish my practical skills. This will dramatically improve my competitiveness when I come back to China to find a job. That is why I choose to study in America over European countries. Canceling STEM OPT Extension is not only unfair to those students who has taken OPT Extension as a benefits when considering American universities for further education but also harmful to the competitiveness of American universities.

Secondly, a lot of people are in their OPT Extension now. Canceling STEM OPT Extension will force them to leave America and leave their current jobs. This will bring a huge loss to companies since they will invest more time and money to train new hires to make up the lost of experienced works. Also lots of projects will be delayed for lack of workers.

Last but not least, STEM graduates staying in American for work actually creates a lot of job opportunities and increases income for American people. The most obvious evidence is the apartment rental or house rental. Additionally, more restaurants and more shopping malls are opened.

So I sincerely suggest that STEM OPT Extension should not be cancelled.
