It is actually a good way to go to motivate talent foreign students to come to US. As more students come, US economy will get healthier and there will be more elite work power joining to build this country. Imagine that if foreign students are only permitted to stay in US for 1 year after graduation, there will be no reason for them to afford the high tuition to study in US, and thus it could cause huge negative impact on both economy and technology development of this country.
