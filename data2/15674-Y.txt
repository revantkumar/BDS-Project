I strongly support the OPT extension. As an international student, the OPT extension for STEM students is the most significant reason that I decided to study in the US, not other countries. Without this policy, I think the American universities are much less attractive to me, and I believe this is also true to many other international students, which will definitely harm the US education industry.
