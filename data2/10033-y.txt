Anonymous Anonymous I feel that It should be strongly supported, US economy is highly affected by this. Universities here in US runs due to international students and removing OPT will definitely decrease the number of incoming students for higher studies. Also H1B in another factor, I think its clear Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc will have to move out of US if students do not get there H1B.
