I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.

(1) It is essential to have 3 years OPT to train a qualified STEM worker.

It provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get training after graduation. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist (compared with the 3-5 years residency period of medical school graduates).

2) STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident and OPT students DO PAY TAX at the same rate of residents.
