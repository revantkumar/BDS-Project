Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate student at Virginia International university. 62% of VIU graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas, who all will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule. 

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

Many of seniors are able to thrive in software industry with great abilities only because of OPT period, which is golden period for all the international graduates. I am graduating in December 2015, after which I wish to give out all my knowledge during OPT that I acquired through my Masters Degree. 

I am very much worried with the possibility of cancellation of STEM EXTENSION, as we graduates were looking forward 
to make use of the golden period to demonstrate our skills after graduation. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I thank america for all educational and future work force to transform me to a professional.
