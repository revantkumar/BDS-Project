Judy Geankoplis I support this proposal and this would benefit for both citizens and international students.

International students have longer legal working period to practice their knowledge after graduation from US college. They will also be important part of the technology development in the nation. The 24-month extension would give them plenty time to improve their working experiences and would allow them to find better working opportunities back to their countries. Meanwhile, they would have more opportunities to make contribution to the nation.

For citizens who are in STEM field, they would have more chances to work with people from international culture background. This would also improve their interpersonal skills and communication skills with people from international in the future. American students would also benefit from this multi-culture environment and would be better prepared for the international business and technology development. They would also benefit from the opportunities of working with international people who might have diverse ideation and creation based on their own culture and education background.

The extension of 24-month would ensure the nation's universities competitive in the world wide and attract more talented international students.
