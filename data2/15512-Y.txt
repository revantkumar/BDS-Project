It is unjust, and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. The world is changing rapidly, and it's becoming more and more convenient for people to study and live from one country to another. It will be a trend that people look for places they prefer to study and work, instead of being restricted by where they are born and which country they belong to. Meanwhile,international students are best ones of their peers, which indicate high-quality contributions to the society they live in, i.e. the American society, and American people will greatly benefit from it. The shortsighted decision of depriving international students' legal right to work in US will in the long run slow down the fast development of this country.
