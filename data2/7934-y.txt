Patrick Tsao I strongly support the extension of OPT for the following reasons:

1. International students make great contributions to America. Those international students didn't decrease the level of wages, but increase it. Talented international students did stimulate the development of start up companies, especially in IT field. Small business is not only a part of American sprit, but also actually contributes a large amount tax.

2. As an employee in IT industry, I think the stagnation of wages in IT industry is caused by the slow development of the IT industry itself, as well as the intensive competition from foreign companies. Obviously, the best students in this industry are mostly educated by American institutions. If we don't give more opportunities to those talented international students graduated from our colleges to serve for our companies, the environment for American companies would be even worse, because we waive our significant assets.

3. America is great because we have courage to embrace diversity. This nation is built by great immigrants from all over the world. If we fear competition, how can we claim that this is the most strongest country in the world? By the way, I think the competitions from international students are an important factor to enhance the development of our economic, and they make us to optimize our education system to suit the competition, which can make American students receive the best education, and keep our competitiveness.
