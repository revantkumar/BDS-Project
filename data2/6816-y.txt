Aileen Joseph If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. International students contributed almost US$27 billion to the US economy in 2014, which corresponds to a 12% increase versus 2013 when the total was US$24 billion. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. This rule will strengthen the relationships between America and other countries. That is, they can share more information, more resources and more opportunities.
