I do support Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students. This extension gives a chance to students, who successfully completed their higher education in the US, to return what they learned and they owe to the growth and progress of the United States. It also gives a chance to the US industry and research community to interact with the people who have received education at the highest quality and evaluate them in order to pick the best ones according to the country's long-term goals, under immigration regulations of the the United States. This is the process that keeps the United States in its current sport which is the ultimate land of opportunities and the pioneer nation in the world.
