I strongly support this rule, because Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees can really help US economy. They are creating new opportunities and are helping US leading the world in high tech industry. 

There is an survey by inc.com shows the following statistics: 

1. Among the Inc. 500 CEOs, there are 21% of them were born outside of US. 
2. Immigrant founders started 52% of all new silicon valley companies between 1995 and 2005.
3. Immigrant business are 60 % more like to export, which is a key factor US economy growth in recent years. 

Like Google founder Sergey Brin who was born in Russia, nonimmigrant students can bring great value to US.
