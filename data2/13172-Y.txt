I support this proposed Rule.

This 24-month OPT extension is a great support for our companies who employ lots of STEM students. These STEM students who have been educated and trained for years with our high standard education are helping with the growth of our economics. Without the OPT extension, Most of them who cannot get a H1B visa in one year will be deported back to their home countries.
