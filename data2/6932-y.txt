Re:Comments on Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students
80 Fed. Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)
Docket ID: ICEB-2015-0002



Dear Chief Westerlund:

I strongly SUPPORT the new regulation because 
1. The international STEM students contribute a lot to the economic growth of US.
2. The world class education that the students obtain from US universities is rightfully used to feed US workforce.
3. The education of the STEM students is not paid by the US tax payers money.
4. STEM students pay taxes like any other US citizen.
5. Being conservative on the STEM policies will make US higher education less attractive to international students and they will start seeking other destinations. 
6. International students are the cream of the best students in the world and hence it is in the best interest of the country to make use of them post education.
7. No education is complete without hands on experience. The students get this through working on OPT in their student visa.

Sincerely,
Mohan
