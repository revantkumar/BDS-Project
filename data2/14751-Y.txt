This change will definitely bring great benefits to U.S (Tech) companies, hence the U.S economy. 

A majority of the workforce, including company founders is comprised of people who were originally F-1 students.
By turning down the opportunities for F-1 students to stay and contribute to the workforce, you'd be turning away those opportunities to have the next Google or Apple here in the U.S.

That would mean great loss to the economy.

Secondly, on average, an international student spend between $100,000 to $200,000 in pursuing education in the U.S.
Eliminating the OPT-STEM program would definitely discourage them from enrolling in U.S schools because that would mean they would not have a lot of opportunities to gain practical experience after graduation. Other countries, such as Australia, the U.K which offer more practical training opportunities, would then be more attractive to international students.
As a result, the U.S universities would lose a substantial amount of prospective students, which would affect not only the financial aspect, but also diversity.
