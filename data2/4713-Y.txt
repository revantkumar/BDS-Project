Why are there so many innovative companies in America?Because America attracts gifted and clever foreigners over the the world to come and build up companies to make profits in this country. And these innovative companies, such as Intel, employ many employees. 

Besides, I want to ask questions to any who deny OPT: what are population of American consisted of? Several hundred years before, the ancestors of current Americans came here from Europe, Asia, Africa etc. to create this great country. Now the same thing is happening!! Every year, the clever students from different countries take advantage of their own gift to make profits here. They are repeating the things as the ancestors of current Americans: creating this great country. 

So I totally agree to extend the OPT.
