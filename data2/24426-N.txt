I'm writing to OPPOSE the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years. It would enable them to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay, thus creating an incentive for them to hire foreign students over qualified Americans. Initially, the OPT program was intended to give foreign students skills they could take home with them to benefit their own countries, not to provide a pool of low-cost labor in competition with American workers. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
