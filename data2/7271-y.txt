Sheila Synder I SUPPORT the extension of OPT.

I support to extend OPT to ensure every qualified STEM student who has 
graduated from US universities to contribute to our country. Why should we 
send those good people out?

My coworker, Kevin, graduated from UCB and joined our company. 
He did a great job. He helped us to start a new project 
with his great knowledge in data analysis area. So we got several full time 
head counts this year and hired several college graduates.

However, he had to stop working because he did not win H1-b lottery 
and ran out of OPT. It is a great loss for our department.

Please help OPT students like him to get a chance to contribute to our 
great country.
