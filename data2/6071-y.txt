Likun Qin I definitely support the opt proposal.
First of all, it is unfair for international student to learn the same thing without get fair job opportunities as the citizens. International students can work harder than than locals which is strongly support the American economy. Declining the proposal will draw back the current of economy, which will let USA end up with lacking enough working force. Look at uk, they forbid international students looking for jobs there and we see what poor economy is happening now. May USA will not be like that.
Secondly, every international student has American dreams! Counting on the immigration is how USA developed from a deserted place to the strong country like now. If the proposal is declined, more students will turn to other countries and contribute to other country, like China. Then USA will be surely left behind!
We should support the opt proposal!
