The new rule to support STEM program is a GREAT decision!!! I strongly support this decision because 1 It shows that government is really giving equal opportunities to the people
2 International students are not taking away jobs but rather promoting economic growth
3 If this decision does not pass, fewer and fewer international students will come, colleges will lose diversity and can even cause financial problems (since international students pay much higher tuition fees than US citizens)
