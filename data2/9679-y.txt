Gregory Bybee I am strongly opposed to expanding or increasing the OPT program. I've been a software developer for over 30 years,
I have seen so many H1-B workers that were hired instead of American workers. The foreign H1-B workers were brought 
into the U.S. and hired by companies that simply want to have a pool of cheap labor that they could use instead of higher 
paid American workers. In every case, their work ethics and work product were inferior to that of the Americans colleagues, 
but the companies apparently didn't mind because they saved money. The foreign workers are also beholden to the 
employer while their visa is being processed. And it appears as though the process was designed to take years so the 
foreign worker is forced to stay at that company during the entire process.

Please do everything you can to stop this OPT expansion and instead help and protect American workers.

Thank you
