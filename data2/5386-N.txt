I am a senior citizen who paid into Social Security and Medicare. This was NOT an entitlement until the government started taking our money away to spend on many unnecessary things. There would be no problem if that hadn't been allowed to happen. I am very unhappy that you may now take more from social security to help pay for OPT. This is unfair not only to seniors, but also to our citizens who have gone to college(at the direction of Obama who says everyone should go to college-what a crock!!!)and now can't find a job.
I have nieces and nephews and greats who have degrees in STEM (like Obama wanted) with huge college debts. Now you want to help foreign students with your OPT and give them our jobs??? Where is the help for OUR students? Do you want our college graduates to not be able to pay for their college and then go into your entitlement programs? It is time the government used some common sense and made foreigners go back home instead of taking our jobs!!
