I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. As we all know, there were a lot of people who have contributed a lot in U.S or World were once to be a international student. U.S. is the country who has most interational student. Those students studied in U.S., gained knowledge in the U.S. and should make effort to the U.S. society and the world. Its their responsbility and their right.

2. There are quite a few international students who had been living in the U.S. in many years. Some of them had got married and got babies. It is hard and unconscionable to force them leave the U.S. after their school. Those international students have well educated and will do good to the safe and stable to the whole U.S. society.

3. The market economy needs competition. Most international students who had received high degree did not gain a job with low payment. They compete with international students and with local students which will increase the competitiveness of the U.S. and do good to the U.S. in the long term.
