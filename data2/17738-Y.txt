I am a Master student of University of Colorado at Boulder, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and I support that US government could expand OPT of F-1 Non-immigrant students. 

Talents in STEM major are important for every nations in the world. The students from other countries, like Chinese and Indian, they are the most outstanding talents of their own nations so that they can obtain admissions to American University,and they work very hard than mainland students in order to remain in America. If US government could give more work opportunities to them, it means America do well in adsorb talents form the whole world, who are almost all outstanding engineers, which will promote prosperity in America industrial community. If not, these students, grasping top technology and ideas which are obtain from America University, come back to their own nations, they will be the technology competitors to America and will influence America leading role in the area of technology and engineering.

Moreover, more foreign talents stay in America doesn't means it will worsen the employment situations. Human would not consume wealth, but will create wealth. These students will create more jobs cause more talents means much more production value, so that means much more manpower demand.
