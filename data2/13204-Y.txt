In past few decades, high tech industry growth has become a dominant factor to our country's strength. This new ruling is a good idea to make our country more competitive in that area. It will attract more talented young man from different land of globe to not only come and study in the university but work to apply their knowledge and talent to the tech companies and so as to bring benefit to the entire U.S. economy. 
In contrast, if without this STEM extension program, it brings up two obvious issues. First, for international students from not so wealthy families, it discourage them from even coming to united states for academic study, as the tuition and living expense is already high, then it reduces the academic communications, hurting the benefit of universities. Second, for the international students that can easily afford the expense, they will be more tending to go home and build their own countries using the knowledge learnt from the best education resource in U.S. instead of bringing benefit to our industries. It is just like we are kindly sharing the education resource to make other countries better but our country will lose so many talents in high-tech industry. 
If we do have this STEM program, new ruling will definitely help attract gifted students from other countries while American students will be more motivated in learning because of competition exists in both school and industry. International students and American students will be learning a lot from each other because of variety of educational background, which is a win-win situation. United States is a country of immigrants, that hundreds and thousands brilliant people come from different continents, speaking different languages, come to help build up the greatest nation in the world. Shutting down this path for international students because of fear of healthy competition, is obvious against the foundation of how this country is built up. So I am supporting this new ruling.
