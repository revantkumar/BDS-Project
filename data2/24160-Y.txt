I strongly support this rule. When the initial 17-month version passed, our country is deep in a recession, and there is no time to pull out a formal procedure. Apparently the 17-month version helped drag us out of the recession. Now it is time for a formal, new rule, that will continue to help us maintain the leadership position in science. 

To many negative comments: don't be afraid to be the leader, don't worry about things that aren't true. Be proud that the best students are willing to work for us, benefit from it!
