Please protect jobs for Americans and our children coming out of college. With an Engineering degree I have found the job market to be very weak and have to compete with foreign workers in science jobs on work Visas. We need to put Americans to work first. Please end or lower all Visa programs until Americans have first pick of all jobs.
