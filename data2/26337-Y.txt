I strongly support this proposal. Most F1 students are well educated and skillful researchers. Importing these people into US industries can only boost the GDP and improve the industry level. USA is number one because she always open to those hardworking and smart people. These people are not grasping job opportunities from local people because there are actually a demand for more employees in America, especially in IT industry.
