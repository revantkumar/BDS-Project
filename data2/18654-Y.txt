What I am worrying is once we stop the STEM OPT extension, there would be less and less students choose STEM as their major in the future. For most american, it looks like we are not prefer to be an engineer or scientist. For internationals, they found they only have 1 year to looking for opportunities and have to attend the work visa draw in the future, probably they would be worrying the high risk once they could not work in US because of the visa status other than their work abilities. It will be shame if this becomes true. That means, we would lose thousands of talent, we would lose the best education in STEM, In one word, 2 years extension is not too long, not too short, just a reasonable period for internationals, I suggest we should keep this extension.
