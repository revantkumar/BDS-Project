I OPPOSE the proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program, as it would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates, and it was never authorized by Congress. 
Allowing U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S. will artificially expand the pool of available workers for jobs, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math. This would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. 
Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. 
Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
