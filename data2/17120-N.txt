I was a computer programmer at one time. Then with all of the additional legal immigrants coming into the U.S. it became harder and harder to find work. So, I guessed that I needed to retrain. I retrained to become a Java Developer, could not find work (because I didn't have enough experience in what I retrained in)! I retrained to become a DBA, could not find work (because I didn't have enough experience in what I retrained in)! I retrained to learn the web technologies, could not find work (because I didn't have enough experience in what I in)! A lot of the expense I paid for and it was definitely my time and effort to learn those technologies. My employer didn't care, nor did they think enough of my efforts to put me in a place where I could utilize those skills either! Why then should the employer of a legal immigrant care whether or not they retrain to learn new technologies? Why should the employers have a financial gain when American workers retrained, paid for the a large portion of it themselves, and the employer wouldn't utilize the new knowledge? There is not that much difference in what legal immigrants are being paid and what Americans are being paid. The difference is that the employer doesn't have to pay into Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes. That's where they save the money. It costs quite abot of money to live in the U.S. compared to other countries, and Americans keep the money in the U.S. in the form of savings, IRAs, mortgages, cars, new electronic gizmos, etc.. When we help our families, they also live in the U.S. Legal Immigrants save money and then send a portion back home to help their families. No need to buy a house, car, IRA, etc.. Why are the legal immigrants getting a better deal then American workers?
