swaminathan mathiyalagan I strongly support the proposed 24 month opt stem extension. We are highly skilled and competent individuals surpassed all eligible criteria required to obtain job in US. Most of us have strong outstanding academic background and motivated to work, therefore the notion of replacing American workers with cheap foreign labor is false. The STEM students benefit the US economy significantly, we pay hefty tuition to fee to American universities, apart from that we spend locally on day to day expenses such as Housing, car, shopping etc. It also encourages the tourist revenue as we invite family and friends to visit us during graduation ceremony or as tourists simply. By not encouraging the STEM opt extension, chances of acquiring job becomes more difficult and thereby discourages foreign students. We fill only the gaps of highly skill workers, which is a minuscule amount as compared to total jobs available. 
Not to mention the US economy would lose millions of dollars, skilled engineers and technicians who contributes to frontier of science and technology
