I definitely support this rule by DHS, 
and I never thought that there would be so many opponents.......

Well, it's normal there are some opponents, but I really feel bad when there are many. If the majority think in that way, it's really a problem, it's not the the problem of any individual, it's the problem of US, when did u become so blind and narrow? even parochialism, ultranationalism and racialism? where are the intellectuals? all silent?

I could imagine what the opponents gonna say, "they" take over "our" jobs, such kind of cliche. But living in such a time of globalization, u really think there's a clear division between them and us? Do u know how many Asians(esp Chinese and Indian) and Europeans support the bay area's tech giants such as Apple, Google, Amazon? in which case you could get your goods delivered, using your iPhone, to search on Google for this page to criticize on who made all these available. So ridiculous. Most of these workers were in STEM, in other words, you actually benefit from what you oppose to. 

I'm a graduate student from Columbia University, one thing I love Columbia the most is its diversity and generosity, sometimes I think it's a global university because of it's broad research scope across the world, but you know what, after graduation, most of them stay in New York serve for local. U could do the opposite, use the best resources of the country to train them and then send them out after graduation... 

Please wake up! US!
