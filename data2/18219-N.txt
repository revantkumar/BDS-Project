This bill should be eliminated. We have so many young people who are actual citizens of our country who need training for good paying jobs. Please, Mr. President, think about all those young folks in inner cities who have no hope of living a normal life. If that money went to them instead, perhaps they would not feel the need to join gangs and would gain in self-confidence. We really need your leadership on this and I know you must see daily the deaths of those young folks every day. A strong leader would put more emphasis on training and placing those kids in jobs with a substantial wage. Sincerely, Helen House
