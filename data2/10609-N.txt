Please stop giving away good paying tech jobs to foreign students and foreign workers. There are thousands if not millions of capable AMERICAN programmers, IT technicians, etc. who need good paying jobs. This H1B and F-1 program is not fair to AMERICAN college graduates and workers. When AMERICAN applicants apply online for a tech job there are hundreds of other resumes in for the same job, it is already too competitive and very discouraging for American unemployed STEM workers.
