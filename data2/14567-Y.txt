I am a Graduate student from Illinois Institute of Technology. Currently I am in my OPT. I took an educational loan for my graduate studies for 30,000$ thinking that I can repay my loan within a year and half after my graduation. Since the court has cancelled the OPT stem extension, I was pushed into a situation that I have to repay the loan within a year, so I can get back to my country without any debts. Moreover, the probability of getting H1b visa is very low considering the number of applications per year and repaying the 30,000$ within a year for a fresher like me is a really hard. If this rule is approved, it will be really great for students like me who have completed their graduate studies using their education loan and who have not obtained their H1b visa in their first attempt. Hoping for a positive response.

Thanks,
