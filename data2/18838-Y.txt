I support the proposal because it will benefit international students as well as the US competitiveness.
First, these talented international students will contribute to the American companies with their expertise, which will lead to continuous economic prosperity and produce more job openings for American citizens.
Second, the OPT extension can attract more and more international students to apply for US universities instead of european universities. These American universities will get better international talents to help maintain the leading position in academia, especially in the area of STEM.
