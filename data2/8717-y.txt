Brenda Hayward I think it is outrageous to consider giving employers an incentive to hire foreign citizens over american citizens.The social security program has enough problems without costing it millions in lost revenue. I've paid to give my son a college education. He graduated with a B.A. and still is working the same part time job he had while attending college. I use to think this government of ours was working to improve our future but, it seems I am wrong.
