As a HR people in a US based tech company, I always access candidates' abilities related to the job before anything else, usually on STEM field. For the US citizens who said international students take their job, the only reason is that they are not qualified for the job. However, I found that the qualified US citizen never fulfill our needs in recent years. The worst thing is that more and more US students quit their STEM degrees for other easier degree. As reported by USA today in recent years(link: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/09/19/stem-majors-opting-for-other-degrees/2828219/). 

Thus, we need more international STEM student to support our company. As proposed, our great nation also need more international STEM to support not only our leading industry, but also our leading education system. It is true that these international students will compete with some US citizens. But, competition is always a good thing to encourage people to improve themselves. Furthermore, these international students will also bring diversities, which is the foundation of this great nation.

Thus, I fully support this proposed rule. Just because it benefits a lot to our people and our nation.
