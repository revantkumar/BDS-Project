It is unconscionable to make it advantageous for US companies to hire foreigners over US workers.
OPT is meant to be a temporary training program and not a bridge to long-term work visa or a way for US companies to hire cheaper foreign labor over Americans.
OPT workers cost Social Security about $1B a year. This is not wise for the US.
It is wrong for OPT to remove billions of dollars from Social Security and Medicare.
There are millions of unemployed/under-employed Americans. 
US companies need to hire Americans first.
OPT is un-American.
