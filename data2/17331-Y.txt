I have to say t is NOT a wise choice to deprive international students' right to work in the US. 

One critical reason is about benefits. As for United States, the contribution of international students is obviously an important part. Actually, given opportunities to work in the US is a process of mutual promotion. Students improve their skills and companies keep professionals, which is "win-win".

Additionally, the policy is about the opportunities. Those who do not have enough abilities are not likely stay in the US and lead to the burden of the government.
