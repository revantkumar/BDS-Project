I strongly support this rule.

Those who are against this rule are shortsighted.

This would allow US to hire more *eligible* STEM workers. Many comments made a point that this would make the citizens harder to get a job. While this might be true, the fact is that there are simply insufficient *eligible* US citizen job candidates in STEM fields. Hiring ineligible candidates will do greater harm to US industries. If we do not allow them to work in the US, they will go back to their home country and make contributions there, using the expertise learned in the US education system. That is to say, US is educating foreigners in high tech industry for other countries.

Also note that STEM students also need to pay federal and state (if applicable) income taxes.
