As a grandmother and concerned citizen, I am opposed to "Optional Practical Training", OPT. Some of my reasons for opposing are thus enclosed.

OPT has already given 433,000 jobs to foreign student/workers, while leaving American workers looking for jobs. Under the
proposed rules, more than 270,000 students will qualify = 700,000.

THE OPT PROPOSAL DOES NOT GIVE PRIORITY TO AMERICAN STUDENTS. We are promoting STEM studies in our
schools and colleges, only for our students to be pushed out of tech fields by employers who favor foreign student/workers.

The OPT Regulations DO NOT specify unusually bright foreign students/workers . Just any foreign student/worker is eligible
for any of our schools, K - graduate school.

The OPT program is actually an EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM !!!!!!!!!! The program allows a foreign student to change to an
H-1B visa, whether he/she has a degree or experience. Therefore, the student is eligible to replace an American worker.
US STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS PRIVILEGED PROGRAM.

The OPT program is an economic advantage to employers and foreign students only. Bonuses of $10,000 to $12,000 will be paid to the employers for hiring foreign STEM students. The employer is, thus, encouraged to hire a F-1 student before a green card holder, or a citizen.

The Social Security Trust Fund has already been shorted $1B per year, because the recent foreign grads are still considered students and do not pay into the fund. ANOTHER REASON FOR THE EMPLOYERS TO WANT TO HIRE
OPT STUDENTS.

There are many regulations that are vague and ambiguous, and are slanted in favor of the foreign student/workers.
For example, the regulations allow the employer to hire uneducated and inexperienced foreign students, even though
the regulations describe the employer as hiring highly skilled student workers. THE EMPLOYER, THEREFORE, CAN
HIRE FOREIGN STUDENT/WORKERS WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In light of unrestricted hiring and vague regulation of the OPT program, there
