I strongly support this rule for various reasons. USA needs talented engineers to work in various field and when you have talented students ready to support your dream they should get fair chance to stay in USA. We help to support the economy when we are students as well as employees. With extension, we might greater chances to legalize our stay and work here thus helping us to achieve our dream as well as yours.
