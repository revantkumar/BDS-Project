STEM OPT is necessary, positive, and that not having it would cause negative impact to many individuals and families that call the United States home. My best friend is among those individuals. He has been living in the United States with his family for almost his entire life. This is an individual who is smart, very talented and graduated from one of the top universities in this country. 
As an American, I want my country to be more advanced in science and research and contribute globally in the advancement of STEM.

The world is changing and we need these incredible smart individuals to stay in this country(which is where they belong). We spent millions of dollars and resources to educate them and we need them now more than ever.
