Junda Qiu I strongly support OPT Extension. Here are my points.
1. The reason I came to the U.S. to study, instead of other coutries, is the U.S. provides better training opportunities to foreign STEM talents. In fact, there has been and will always be huge demends of foreign STEM students to support most US STEM companies. Without OPT, It could be a disaster for US hi-tech industry.
2. The U.S. has a convention of absorbing talents all over the world. It is the same as she was doing from 18th century to build this empire with advanced immigration plan. Typically, most foreign STEM students can go through over 24-month projects with 12+24 OPT which means great. If OPT is too short, most projects would be severely hurt and even aborted.
3. Better training opportunities will bring more foreign STEM student studying in the U.S. and increae local house renting income for native americans. Take example from my landlord, he seriously hopes more foreign students, especially Chinese students rent his house. He is actually working in Barclays Bank in Manhattan, so he has to move to the City leaving his New Jersey house rent. This house turns out to be a good thing for him that not a tax 'black hole', but a working 'dollar printing machine'.
