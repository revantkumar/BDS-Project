William Pessel I strenuously and categorically oppose this proposed rule because it places the interests of foreign students and the american universities and employers that profit from cheap labor before the interests of american graduates and american employees, who are competing for jobs and may be out of work. The unemployment rate is too high, salaries/wages are too low, and this proposed rule is designed to make both worse for american students and employees, while benefiting only foreigners, employers that want cheap labor, and universities whose first goal is profit at the expense of americans.

The proposed rule is objectionable because it is also designed to raise tuition by creating greater demand from foreigners, thus injuring american students and their families, who must pay exorbitant and ever increasing tuition, while foreigners benefit from the chance to win US citizenship and universities enrich themselves. 

How dare the department state: "The proposed changes would also help ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States." Since when is our nation and our government here to help colleges and universities "remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and remain in the US"? Admission of so many foreign students is damaging to american students and employees and a betrayal of the american people. Do not insult the american people with these lies that this rule is designed to benefit the USA.
