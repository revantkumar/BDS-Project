Meredith Alleruzzo Increasing diversity in the workplace is great, as is exposing foreign students to our educational and business environments. I was a foreign student in France and worked in British Columbia for a few months. And I taught English to adult immigrants for years before retiring in June. However, offering those opportunities should never push American workers aside. Never. They should only be offered jobs for which there's an inadequate pool of qualified or willing U.S. citizen or green card-holding applicants. They should come last.

Several years ago a teacher friend encountered this. The district hired teacher trainees from Spain at a lower pay grade. My friend was asked to give her parking space to a trainee. The district and trainees won at the expense of long-term teachers. The current trend expands on this perk for businesses.

In my view a rational approach is to require that employers submit with annual taxes documentation of new hires, outreach for citizen/naturalized citizen applicants, and a rationale for seeking foreign applicants. Employers who fail to prioritize citizen/green card holder applicants would result in a significant fine. Creating a bureaucracy to monitor this might be cost-prohibitive so taking care of it in conjunction with taxes might be the best way to go.
