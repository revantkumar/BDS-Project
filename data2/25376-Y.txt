I strongly support the STEM extension for the following reasons: 
1. Foreign students have contributed a lot to the development of Tech field in US. It is one of the reasons why US can obtain such a large talent pool and become a leader in the technology field around the world
2. It takes time for talented students to internalize leanings and apply what they have learnt after graduation, and at the same time, contribute to US tech and science development.
3. Longer OPT will attract more talented students to come to US and shorter term OPT will greatly de-motivate them. As a result, the brain drain will be very severe. 
4. Big tech firms will find a large gap to fill in qualified people to highly technical roles, and possibly result in discontinuity to maintain normal business processes.
