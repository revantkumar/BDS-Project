I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. International students get the same level of education with domestic people, and we even take more money and time to achieve our study. We have right to get more time and chance to try working in here.
2. We use different language and come to a total strange environment to further education. If we can insist, that can prove us, which we have the ability of working with domestic people and even have more advantages than domestic people, such as we can use two language familiarly. 
3. We work here is contributed to USA, not other country. That is good for USA's economic development.
