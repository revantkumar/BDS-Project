I STRONGLY SUPPORT the OPT proposal for the following reasons:

1. Foreign Students contributes a large proportion of university education incomes, and it is for sure that there will be a great decline in the number of foreign students if this proposal is not passed, and that will very likely result in an increase in the university tuition.

2. If the proposal is not passed, then there will be a huge negative impact on the large firms as many of there current employees are in OPT status. 

3. This law will encourage competitions, which is indeed very beneficial to the overall U.S. economy.
