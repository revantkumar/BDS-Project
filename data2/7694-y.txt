jenny zhang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Extension will attract more competitive students come to U.S instead of other countries. Thus, U.S has the opportunity to choose more competitive students in the world.
2. Extension benefit for the development of companies. Many companies are expanding their markets in other countries, like google and Uber, which needs international students. Many of many friends are talent, creative and hard-working. They are willing to contribute themselves to American and extension is the way to let them have more opportunity and time to contribute.
