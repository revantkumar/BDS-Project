I am against expanding the STEM OPT rule proposed by DHS. This program in 2009-2013 authorized over 430,000 jobs in the USA for foreign nationals ONLY and USA citizens were NOT eligible. In addition neither the employer nor the employee paid any taxes into Social Security or Medicare which caused lost revenue of FOUR BILLION Dollars. This program is just a way to circumvent caps on H-1B visas and definitely penalizes USA citizens. This DHS program wants to expand at a time when many STEM US citizens are either unemployed, underemployed or had to leave STEM.
