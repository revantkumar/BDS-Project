I SUPPORT to expanding training opportunities for F-1 Students.

I am not an attorney or an accountant. I only have some comman sense.

1. F1 students pay the international tuitions. That means US gov did not pay for their education. If an F1 student want to stay in US and find a job in a tech company, does this mean US gov saved a lot of education budget.

2. For the 7% employer's payroll tax, let's make an analogy. If you want to hire a nanny to take care of your baby or find a preschool for your toddler, what's the most important factor you want to see? The 7% cheaper cost? Absolutely not.

3. The most important one I think is DO NOT let the talented students go back to their home countries, otherwise they will be hired by some famous companies in the emerging market which, nowadays, is a huge challenge and competitor of American companies. Think about Cisco Vs Huawei, Apple Vs Samsung, MTK. 

If you guys still want America to be the DOMINATOR of the world, KEEP these talented students.
