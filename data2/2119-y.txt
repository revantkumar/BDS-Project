Joshua Robles I totally agree with this extension. I know that lots of American students oppose this extremely because they are worried about losing job opportunities. Actually what determines a man can get a job or nor is not lie in how much candidates are competing to get the job, it is the qualification. Many international students are more qualified than the American students. And I think the strong ability of the international students can motivate American students study harder, so with both strong strength of the American students and international students, America could be more powerful! This is not harming you, it's benefiting you!
