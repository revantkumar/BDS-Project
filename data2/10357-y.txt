Subrahmanyam Wuppalapati As somebody who has taken advantage of a similar program, I am at a point in my career where I am looking to grow the company that I work for and provide employment opportunities locally in the US. I find it hard to find the right skills for helping our company grow because of lack of skilled workforce. As a result, we are looking to expand our presence into Mexico. However, a program like this will help us keep the jobs local to the US and keep the talent in the US. Similar to me, I hope they will also create jobs and help the local US economy.
