Balachandar Vedarathinam I have read the proposed rule. I think its really great for all F-1 students to have more time in OPT to apply H1B. previously they had only 2 chances (approx) to apply H1B. Now they all have 3 clear chances. This is really great news for all STEM F-1 students. I support this proposed rule for OPT extension
