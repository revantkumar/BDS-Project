I strong support the new OPT policy.

America's economy significantly relies on high-tech industry, in which International students make great contributions. The main reason that America has world's first class high tech companies is that it has access to world's brightest elites. Some people are against the regulation because they think having too many immigrants will lower the wages of employees. However, it is not the case. Nearly all international students obtain their OPT for getting H1B visas, which requires them to have the working ability which meet a minimum salary standard that is much higher than the minimum wage level. STEM students may go back to the countries welcoming them, which is a huge loss to America.

Refusing international students would gain us a temporary illusive relief but do harm to the U.S. economy in the long term. But consider the scenario that STEM students may go back to their motherland or other countries welcoming them. What a huge loss to America!

Therefore I will strongly support this rule.
