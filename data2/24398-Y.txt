For the long run of the relationship between China and United States, the education collaboration is very important. First of all, the students who can work in US will be a strong power for helping US to establish a stable working force and on the other side, it's helpful for these students to find a good job when they go back China. Secondly, the longer the students can work in US, the more benefit will US and China get out of this. Because the longer students can work for US, the better outcome will US get and also the more working experience that students will have.
