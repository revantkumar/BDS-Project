I strongly support the proposal! It is true that foreign students may increase comppetetion, but it is not a bad thing! The competetion between US and foreign students may encourage US students to improve themselves continuously which will lead to improvement od the whole US! Moreover, foreign students do not compete with US students with a lower salary, they just compete equally! If a foreign student and a US citizen is as good as each other, the employer will tend to hire the US citizen because they share more in common! So foreigners do not threathen US citizens job oppotunies!
