I strongly support this proposed rule. For those who suggested that international students in STEM would jeopardize citizens' job opportunities, I would say that their opinions are not reflecting the truth. 

Actually, talented international students directly or indirectly created more job opportunities for US. For example, one of the founders of snapchat Mike Krieger was an international student in Stanford and he definitely created thousands of new job opportunities for US. Also, one reason that successful companies in STEM fields stands at the top of the same industry is the contribution of talented international students. The more competitive these companies are, the more job opportunities they will provide. Of course, canceling OPT extension will temporarily remove some competitors for citizens, but that's short sighted. If these companies shrinked, it would be less opportunities for citizens of STEM field and those talented students will help the companies of other countries or even rivals of US which is definitely not a desired result. 

From the statistics of 2012 we can see that the unemployment rate of STEM is much lower than other fields. Also STEM industry grew much faster than other ones. The shortage of talented employees in STEM is real, and the statistics speaks loud. The statistics can be found at US government official websites.

Also the argument that foreign students take the same job with lower salary is also not reflecting the truth. Most companies hiring employees with OPT visa status will apply H1B for them, which requires a minimum salary level by law. So the saying that the foreigners took jobs from citizens by lower salary doesn't hold in legal employees in American which includes students with OPT extension.

So in conclusion, those arguments about OPT extension will jeopardize US citizens' work opportunity are not able to hold themselves.This proposal about OPT extension should pass for the best interest of US
