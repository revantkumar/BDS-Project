I strongly support the OPT extension. You can not admit that most of the tech firms need these STEM students. Without the OPT extension, hundreds of firms will be affected. Tech firms represent the innovation of America and we should create a stable and friendly environment for the development of these tech firms rather than abruptly send their employees back to their own countries.
