TZ Y I am a student major in statistics. I find that United States is in short of statisticians. One example is in health research area. Lots of designs of clinical trials or observational studies need statistician. However, lots of studies have been done without enough consideration which is a waste of money in some sense and could probably lead to inconsistent or misleading conclusion. I do think the extension of OPT is helpful for United States to get more talent people helping making it a better place.
