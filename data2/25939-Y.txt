OPT provide a good method for companies to screen out professionals worldwide. Without creativity views from different cultures to keep the technology advance of companies, enterprises will lose their competitiveness, which could eventually impair their ability to provide work opportunities. Therefore, I support OPT, it could provide not only opportunities for international students, but also benefits for U.S.A. companies.
