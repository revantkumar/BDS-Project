I disagree with the concepts of this proposed rule. We have plenty of native born candidates in this country for these opportunities and we do not need to bring foreigners here to take their places. We already have plenty of people in this country and we are constantly battling the problems of pollution and congestion and more people don't help with these issues. Many of these people will make their money in this country and send much of it back to their home country damaging our economy. Many companies want these sorts of people to come to our country as they will accept less pay for the work done and this is not good competition for our workers and just a way to make the wealthy more wealthy. We need to focus on promoting our own people, not outsiders.
