I strongly SUPPORT Improving and Expanding Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

1. US education more attractive be more attractive to international student. Think about the huge amount of tuition that our universities earned from them.

2. It will benefit the US society as well. I am an software developer and working with several fresh STEM international student. They are all smart, creative and efficient. Honestly, they are more hardworking than local US students. 

3. Some people argue this will take jobs from US people-that's not true at all. For those STEM international students I met in my work, most of them want to come back to their own country to start their own business or find a better job-they just want to gain some experience here. 

4. After all, OPT is just an TEMPERORAY working permit with time limit.
