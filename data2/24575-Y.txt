I strongly support this extension.
This STEM extension is for high education work force that can greatly enhance the technical leading force of united states, meanwhile, many job can be created as byproduct. This is not to take job from Americans, many of my employees are foreigners, and they helped me expand my business by innovation, by hardworking spirit.
Also, foreigner students pay tuition fees, this is an important income for local universities, universities your son / daughter attend. These tuition fees are normally higher than what US students pay and if US is not good for them to come for higher education they will go elsewhere.
