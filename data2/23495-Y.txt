As a Ph.D. Student with a F1 visa, OPT extension is incredibly important. We are not focusing on immigration, what we want to have is some working experience which would make us more competitive when we go back to our country. If we graduated from an American university and did not find jobs, how could we expect that we would find jobs easily even without studying in our country. 

Immigration issue is always a problem for this society. However, F1 visa and OPT are definitely not the primary factors. Those who don't support this probably think that F1 students steal their jobs. However, the fact is those students are more competitive in the job market. They study hard , work hard and try hard. Why don't they deserve to have a job here ? Currently tech companies especially high tech companies have tons of foreign students. If we pay money to receive education, we need to have some kind of practical application here. 

Hope OPT extension could be passed.
