With the labor participation rate at it's lowest in history we can't believe our socialist in chief is once again putting foreigners welfare ahead of our own U.S. Citizens!
This is absolutely unacceptable and obvious pandering to his buddies and contributors. I have been an engineer in the high tech field for about 30 years now and can tell you first hand 
that I know of many talented and capable people who are unable to get a job because corporations are hiring employees from Ireland, India and the Philippines instead.
While that is great for them, we have many qualified individuals in this country who have to stay on unemployment because of this action.
This not only hurts them and their families but also hurts us all as we all have our taxes go to qualified individuals who are unable to get a job due to practices such as this.

When will you start standing up for the U.S. Tax paying citizens who pay your salary and for all your social agendas?
