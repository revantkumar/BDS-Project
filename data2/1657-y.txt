Erin Liu Preventing STEM students from entering the U.S. is not the solution to unemployment! U.S. unemployment is not caused by STEM. Preventing the OPT extension for STEM will not make things better but even make things worse. Please focusing on gaining real expertise and skill sets that will make you competitive in a job market than whining about loosing protection.
