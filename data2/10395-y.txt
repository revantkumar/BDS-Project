Xiao Xiao, Purdue University I believe both Americans and international students will benefit from this rule for the following reasons.

1. Most of the large companies in the U.S. offer job opportunities specifically for international employees, which means those spots are reserved for international students. It also indicates the employment of international students will not affect the employment of domestic candidates.

2. The number of H1b visas is limited. Each year only the candidates luckily enough to get this visa can continue work in the U.S. legally. So the extension of OPT will not increase the number of employments for foreigners. It only provides more time for a dedicated international student with STEM degree to explore his career in the U.S. 

3. U.S. government has already approved a 5 year student visa for Chinese students. It means the government is encouraging international students to study abroad in the U.S.. There will be quite a large group of international students study in the U.S. for the next 5 years. I believe only the extension of OPT will give more international students to have the chance to work in the U.S.. Otherwise it will be too hard for them to find the job opportunists.
