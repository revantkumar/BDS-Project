Tom Cui I am a STEM student from China. As many of my friends who have decent education and come to U.S. for a dream, I hope the rule of OPT extension for STEM student can be APPROVED. 

Facts prove that many of us foreign STEM student contributed to the high-tech economy as excellent engineers and industry leaders. We are not taking jobs from U.S. citizens but actually contributed to the pool of most talent tech-guy which is key to keep the innovative spirit of United States. 

Lots of universities in U.S. is world famous and have excellent STEM education and stunning long history of reputation. But if there is no STEM OPT extension policy from Homeland Security Department, they will become less attractive.
