XING LAN As the aging infrastructure in America, America does need more engineers to renovate infrastructure. OPT is a good option that provide talented international students to work and make contributions to America society, which in turn, help America grow economy and create more job opportunities. And somehow, because of their ties with their home counties, which in turn again, promote bilateral trading. So, I strongly support OPT extension policy!
