Oliver Fan I support this proposal because this proposal will benefit US, the country. First, international students bring both short-term and long-term benefits for both culture and economy. Short-term benefits include tuitions, living costs and so on. For long-term, US is a country that benefits from diverse culture and international students is an significant input for diversity in culture. So it is important to attract international students. OPT STEM extension is an big attraction for foreign students because it allows them to practice what they learned in school in the relevant industries. Second, other countries are competing with US for these international students, if US cancels this policy, it will fail in this competition. So I support this proposal!
