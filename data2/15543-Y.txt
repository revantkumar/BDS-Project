Many blames on this proposal will affect the Americans from getting hired are sort of misleading. Every year, there are about 60 thousands of H1B workers imported from India and most of those people only had a bachelor's degree or lower. If you want to find a reason for not finding the jobs, that could be the reason. 

I myself have several well-educated friends who are international students and they are well-deserved to find a job with their advanced degree. If they are forced to leave the country and work for other competing countries because of the failure of this proposal, that would be a shame for the U.S.
