The OPT should be eliminated and should not have existed to begin with. All these foreign students "vowed" or "claimed" they had no plan to seek for employment or stay in the States after graduation, which would otherwise get their F1 visa denied. It is so obvious that they all lied to the USCIS during their F1 application, as they all now want to work and stay in this country with clear intention for immigration.
