As a born U.S citizen, I fully support the new rule of the OPT extension. The United States is in dire need of intelligent workers in STEM related fields. As a woman in the engineering field it saddens me to see so many other fellow citizens fail to become something other than a burden to this country, while other foreigners who want to be here and work hard to be here are not given the chance to do so. These are good hard working people that give it their all just to have a chance at becoming part of this great nation. The US is a nation of immigrants and to not give these brilliant minds a chance to be part of it is unfair.
