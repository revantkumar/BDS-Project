I firmly support the STEM OPT extension program.

By reading some of the comments, I found many of the opposition comments are based on misunderstanding.

Many people complain American people are jobless because of OPT program. For example, http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=ICEB-2015-0002-6343 blames OPT because his son cannot find job in fast food chain. I feel sorry for his son's jobless, but he totally misunderstood the OPT program. By the requirement of OPT, the training job must be related to the undergraduate or graduate degree, so there is no competition on entry level jobs in fast food chain. Maybe, he observed some abuse of OPT program, which took fast food chain job from his son. Then, he should have support the new proposal, which improves regulation on the OPT program.

Does American people lost jobs because of OPT program? Or more specifically, does American STEM students lose jobs because of the STEM OPT extension program? The answer is clearly NO, based on the job hunting experience of my classmates. As listed on http://www.stat.wisc.edu/doctoral-graduates, almost all the doctoral graduate students, including American students and international students, get a good job in high tech company or research institute. The demanding of STEM graduated employers is high. Nobody loses job because of the STEM OPT extension program.

If we forced the well trained international students to leave America by shutting the OPT STEM extension program, we are actually force companies to move job opportunities to other countries, because of the shortage of well trained employers. Once the job opportunities moves to other countries, they will never come back to America. America has already lost manufacturing industry, does America afford to lose high tech job opportunities?
