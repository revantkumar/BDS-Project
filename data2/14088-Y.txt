OPT STEM extension is good for US as well as Chinese students.

1. In my graduate university (CMU Computer Science), 95% of students are Chinese and Indian students. American students do not like to learn STEM, such as EE and CS. So, I do not think we, foreign students, snatch jobs with american workers.

2.There are only about 50 thousand foreign students come to US each year. It is not a big number.

3. We are not cheap labor. The average salary of my classmates in the same program is $114,146/year (only base salary, https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/learn-us-alumni). 

4. Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. If we cancel OPT STEM, I think US universities cannot attract so many excellent students any more.

5. I came to CMU to get a master degree for the reason that I knew I can use OPT STEM to work for three years. Now, you canceled it. What can I do? This is the behavior of bad faith

6. If I can work at Google for three years, I will be very valuable after I come back to China. If I can only work for one year, I am not that valuable. So, I think OPT STEM is very helpful for me!

To sum up, I really think US need OPT STEM and Chinese students need OPT STEM. Please approve this good policy. Thanks!

Best,
