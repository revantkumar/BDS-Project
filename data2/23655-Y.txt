Students who come in USA, all of them are highly qualified as they have to compete with all brains in the world. So after finishing the degree, they should have given the chance to settle down. They should be given the chance to find a same field job so that they can contribute, their education become fruitful. 

The proposed system is a good one and will give students time to achieve some expertise. USA is going to be the most beneficial one. 

I support this proposed rule and hope soon this rule will be a real , declared one.
