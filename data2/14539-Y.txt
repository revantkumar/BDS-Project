As a potential students whose major is electrical engineering, I strongly SUPPORT the extent OPT for the following reasons:
1.International students can have many stimulating effects to the local economy. Considering that the every day expense are relatively large when compared to the situation when in home country, many fields of industry, for example, housing, can have benefits. 
2.Extent opt appeals more students. These days I have chatted with many friends about the proposal, and their career plan. Most of us planned to go back home after accumulating years of working experience because they can be more competitive in their homeland. Thus the more international students actually do not reduce the job opportunities for local citizens. If the opt is only one year, many students may not choose to go out because less job time deteriorate their advantage when coming back home. If there are less international students, there could be economic decline in the long run.
