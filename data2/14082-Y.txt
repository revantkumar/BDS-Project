I strongly support this proposal. As an international student who studied in America for my undergrad and graduate school, OPT is a very important reason that attracted me to America rather than other countries. I am studying computer science and a lot of world top companies in this area are in the US, such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. Being able to work at these companies in summers or after graduation is a huge attraction to me when applying for schools. This is a more direct way to learn about the industry and gain experience before a formal job. I believe the extension of OPT would attract more top students around the world to the US. 

Some opponents of the proposal worries that too many international students will enter the job market and cause the Americans to lose their jobs. There is definitely no need to worry about this. Most international students come to America to get high-level eduction, i.e. masters or PHDs. And the employees need to sponsor their visa application if they want to hire an international student. Therefore, an international student is much more expensive than a local American. Unless really needed, an employer would definitely prefer a citizen rather than hiring a foreign student. Moreover, we international students come to America to seek better life. We paid the high tuition in the hope that we can get a good job after graduation. So we would not accept a lower payment for a job. The people who actually stole the jobs are those illegal immigrants. They are the ones that are willing to accept less pay and the ones that employers are willing to hire to save money.
