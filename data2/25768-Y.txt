I support this new rule. I will not argue how this would benefit students with a F-1 visa, as it is obvious. I will explain how this actually would be beneficial for workers with U.S. citizenship.

Hear is the reasoning: Without this rule, lot of capable workers under OPT would not be able to get an extension, and would be deported from the U.S. Most of them did apply for H1B under their employers' sponsorship, but couldn't get it due to the CapGap. To get a replacement of those workers, the company needs to spend time, effort, and money on hiring, and might in the end get some non-capable workers just to fill in the space. A short-sighted person might argue this helps US citizens to get jobs, but in the long-run, companies would not be able to compete with their competitors all over the world who can hire anyone without any restrictions, and given that these deported workers are STEM majors, the U.S. would fail in her leading position in technology. This would cause disastrous impact to the U.S. economy, and in the end, more U.S. workers would lose their jobs.

In short, this rule is win-win to both the students and the U.S. economy, which is to say beneficial to the U.S. workers. I sincerely think this rule should get approved. Thank you for reading my comment.
