Jason Wilson With the amount of unemployed Americans we have. Along with those that have given up on looking for work. Along with legal immigrants already here tired of being undercut by their foreign counterparts who are willing to work for less pay, temporarily. I would say our government is sanctioning sweatshop conditions, killing cultural and race relations while claiming to want the opposite. Forcing working class Americans into a life of asking for handouts from others. Doesn't sound that much different from slavery. Americans First!
