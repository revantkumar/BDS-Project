I strongly SUPPORT Improving and Expanding Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

Some people argue this will take jobs from US people-that's not true at all. For those STEM international students I met in my work, most of them want to come back to their own country to start their own business or find a better job-they just want to gain some experience here. 

However, this policy will make US education more attractive to international students.Think about the huge amount of tuition that our universities earned from them each year.
