I strongly support the proposed STEM OPT extension rule. I'm a foreign worker in construction industry. I have a master degree in construction management, and my talent and skills have brought huge benefit to the company that I'm working for. My boss has to admit that although they don't wanna hire foreigners due to VISA issue, it's so hard for them to find a guy like me in local. 
So they applied greencard for me, and want me to continue utilized my talent and skills. I think most of international student in OPT are like me. They are well educated, highly skilled. Imagine that there are 2 person who have same degree and same level of technical skill, one is US citizen and one is international student, it's obvious that the company will hire the US citizen. So I believe that international students who are able to find a job are absolutely more skilled, and they are needed to help to save the situation the STEM shortage.
