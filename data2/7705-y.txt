Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a recent graduate from the University of Oklahoma (OU) and 51% of OU graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. We will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

I am on OPT and planning to use STEM OPT Extension after the expiration of the initial 1 year of OPT period. I am working at Cummins Inc. as a part of my optional practical training. I am paying tax and contributing to US economy.

I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension and the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best regards,
