I opt for expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees. American population is decreasing and less people are getting jobs in tech position. However, the number of tech jobs is still increasing in a great amount. Expanding OPT for stem students could help meet the increasing needs for the tech job positions, as well as making contribution to some advanced technology developments.
