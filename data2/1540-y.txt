Tian Lan This rule should be approved, and here's a few reasons why to support my opinion.

First, the graduates with STEM degrees work for several major industries to apply their knowledge and skills learned at school. These industries need this human capital support. Without all these talents contributing, how do all the employers go about filling the huge gaps left there?

Having a improved and expanded OPT program for these students will increase the number of people who choose these programs in universities and colleges. This helps all the educational institutions to sustain its capital liquidity, and thus provide higher education quality to all students across the country. Without a reasonable opportunity to stay and work after graduation, prospective students may hesitate when applying to U.S. universities and colleges. They pursue the opportunities which offer education, and a chance to apply the knowledge gained through education.

These STEM graduates can usually find well-paid jobs due to the high demand and insufficient supply of their skills. Therefore they pay a significant amount of tax. These people are mostly young, healthy, hard-working, and consuming little to none social welfare.

The U.S.'s success today is inseparable from the incredible efforts contributed by immigrants. All these STEM graduates are contributing the same way, building a better nation together with everyone else. For the best interest of the U.S. as a nation, and for a brighter future of all its people. I strongly urge that we should approve this rule and help the people who are helping us.
