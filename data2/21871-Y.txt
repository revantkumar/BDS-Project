I am a student from an East Asian country. I am taking a immigration economics. From what I have learned in class and read in papers, I would say that expanding OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students do far more good than harm. First, these F-1 students are not likely to compete with the a large number of native workers, who just completed education of high school and less. Second, since there has been a shortage of skilled workers in US labor market, the OPT extension will provide labor to the needed industries. As the labor shortage is alleviated, it is foreseeable that the overall productivity will go up and industry is expanding, which in the end is good for not only the immigrant workers but for native workers as well! Again, those F-1 students are in their early ages. They are not using much of the social services provided by the government. They are contributing part of their income for tax revenues. There are certainly some misleading opinions in the media; if you consult an economist or social scientist, they will tell you the truth.
