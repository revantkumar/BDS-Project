Students with STEM degrees are the essential contributors to the development of US high-tech fields including engineering and biomedical researches. There is an urgent and increasing need for employees in the job market for these high-tech industries and institutions every year. I strongly disagree with some comments about foreign students taking too many American's job opportunities. In the areas that require high education, high technique and specialized skills, foreign employees are filling the gaps of positions rather than taking Americans' positions! Therefore, the government should definitely improve and expand the OPT for F1 students with STEM degrees!
