Lu Chen I fully support extension on OPT, which benefits international students, American high-tech industry and local people. First, International students are the major part in STEM field. They contributes their talents and GDP to this country, make money for American company and pay tax. They should be allowed stay legally. Second this policy will attract more international students. Large number of them will spend lots of money here and create more jobs for locals.
