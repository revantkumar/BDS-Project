Strongly support for the extension. Since when America becomes a country of judging people by who they are instead of what they can do? International students work harder and complain less simply because these people cherish the opportunities of proving themselves the most. I understand some Americans are complaining about how foreigners take their jobs away but are these complaints signs of being competitive? Absolutely not! If a country wants to protect their own citizens on securing the jobs in the market, the worst decision will be to put them into a greenhouse where every breakfast is prepared before they wake up. Better education should be the way to help people get jobs. The OPT extension are able to help companies grow faster and think smarter, especially for those with international influences.
