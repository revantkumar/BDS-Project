Peter Zhu I strongly support this policy, 
OPT will not only benefit US companies, and will also attract more international students to attend school here in the US.The OPT is a comprehensive and beneficial program to allow students to gain more practical experience. Which will make the overall study experience more fulfilling and meaningful.
Adding the diversity and competence to US will not benefit International students, it will also benefit US people as well.
