xiaobo zhou As one of those international students get involved in this, I 100% support passing the new OPT extension regulation, that is to extend it to 3 year length. Our skillsets are what US needs, we have been funded by US tax payers to study STEM subjects, if we leave this country right away without working here, it is not just a loss of our career, it is also a loss of US education. This actually hurts both sides-the international STEM students and US economy.
