How about providing incentives to small U.S. businesses who need additional workers, but, with the high cost of U.S. labor, the costly impact of Obama Care on employers, and the increasing minimum wage requirements, can't afford to add additional staff. We don't need to go to foreign countries to find employable workers, just check out our colleges, trade schools and universities. Let's provide the financial incentives to U.S. companies hiring and training U.S. workers. 
Our country is already rapidly becoming a third world country, due to our failure to enforce immigration laws already on the books. Crime has increased, slums have increased and hospitals are closing due to their financial inability to provide 'free' services to indigent, illegal foreigners.
Let's forget about this PC crap and 'put America and Americans FIRST! When we are once again a prosperous and financially secure country, then it will be time to look into the problem(s) of foreign workers. NOW IS NOT THE TIME!
