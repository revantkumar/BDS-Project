Hrishikesh Amravatkar I support reform that would help F-1 students. I had to struggle a lot as a student with the broken immigration system. An international student has to go through unimaginable financial and emotional distress to live and survive in a foreign land. And immigration leaves a really bad taste in their mind regarding United States. Infact, immigration backlogs and unnecessary discrimination especially for students from India, has caused a stronger negative sentiment the minds of future US residents and naturalized citizens . And thats why we either move back to India and create jobs there or have a strong tie to India.
