Xinyi Li Imagine this country without those aspiring people - Albert Einstein, Andy Grove, and Elon Musk. They are well-known scientists and engineers in America. One common aspect about them is, they are all immigrants.

As a professional working at the Human Resources Department in the most well-known electric car company in the world, I'd say I am deeply impressed by the diligence reflected on those top talents coming across the globe. I see they work day and night, utilizing analytics to make sense of big data; I see they brainstorm with great efforts, improving self-driving technology. I even see them start a new family here, passing along the spirit of courage and innovation to the next generation - a generation representing future of the United States.

They graduated from top universities in their home country, and came to the United States pursuing a higher education. Eventually, a majority of them will choose to start a promising career in this dream land. Their broad knowledge and proven experiences will for sure contribute to this society. Why would America say no to those rising stars?

If you close the door to these very best talents in the world, you are losing your future. Although I am happier to see they make contributions to their home country, I respect their love for America and their wish to stay.
