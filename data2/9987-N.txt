I have worked in the STEM field since 1985; I worked steadily until 2014, when I was dismissed by my employer and replaced with foreign workers in the Philippines, India, and here in New Jersey.

During my time of unemployment (from January 2014 to March 2015), I noticed that many well-qualified software developers were in the same boat -- that the companies which employed us were routinely replacing high-wage and (I like to think) high-value older American workers with H-1B holders and off-shore workers.

So, before any "expansion of opportunities" for the foreign students, it is incumbent upon the Homeland Security Department to _prove_ that there are no Americans (whether citizens or legal residents) available to do the same work. Note: not the same work at the same price -- I mean the same work at any price.

Our national immigration policies should not be merely a means by which employers can save millions in salary costs; especially since such machinations necessarily reduce the American tax base.
