I fully support this rule to keep skilled talented people in US. If our people are skilled and qualified enough for those jobs, there is no need to worry. The facts is that highly-educated highly-skilled international students will bring positive competition into our society and also thrive our economy. If US citizens need jobs, they should follow the steps making themselves qualified. American is a country of immigrants after all. Everyone should have the right to live a better life and that is American spirit.
