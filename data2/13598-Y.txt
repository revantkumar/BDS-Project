I strongly support that the OPT extension bill. 
This bill bring abundant talented international immigrants that are willing to work hard and contribute to this country and fulfill the American dreams! American is a great nation built upon immigrants, those who have decent education and professional skill sets that can actually make the American companies competitive. 
If you have ever stayed in any engineering colleges in any university for some time, you will find out that it is the international students who are actually staying late in the lab doing experiments and working on degrees. There are not that enough American students in the University that are willing to study in STEM majors, which means there will be a huge lack of work forces in various American companies if all those international STEM students have to leave US after 12 months of OPT. This is a disaster to the US economy. My fellow Americans, think this through and show some foresight by letting those talented international students stay!
