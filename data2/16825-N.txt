It is absolutely unforgivable and unconstitutional for this president to continue to overreach his powers and try to implement a change that has not been approved by the legislature that represents the tax-paying voters. We have significant numbers of TAX-PAYING!!!! legal citizens who are far more qualified than these foreigners, the latter of which will pay NO TAXES!!!! and take away jobs that belong in this country!!!

President Obama has trampled on our Constitution and this is just another blatant attempt to weaken the American economy, strip American citizens of equal rights and opportunity, while empowering foreigners to make money without being taxed and enjoy benefits and so many other freedoms and opportunities that our own LEGAL, tax-paying citizens are being stripped of. 

This should be considered illegal and President Obama should face charges for betraying the Constitution of the United States.
