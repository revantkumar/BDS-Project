Jiazhi Ou I work for a fortune 500 company and we are in great need of work force that have STEM background. And there is always a shortage of such workers. STEM students are smart and they work hard. They contribute a lot to the company and the US economy. I strongly support extending the OPT for all students with STEM majors.
