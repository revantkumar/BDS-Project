I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governments should let the students who learned knowledge and technology from US universities stay in the US and let them make contribution for this country.

2.Diversity is important for the US. A lot of outstanding people, like the founder of Instgram, were a F1 Visa holder. They are contributing a lot to this country. The international students also can contribute to the country in the future, but all they need is just an opportunity.

3. Competition does exist, but is not bad. The competition can help the country move forward, can help the country keep being dynamic.
