Wen Zhang To whom it may concern,

I believe that it is urgent to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees for the following reasons. 

First, U.S. can not suffer the lose of these valuable people under the intense competition around the world. A lot of countries other than U.S. are doing whatever they can to attract STEM degrees students to help them obtain advanced work in research, industry and further technology. Countries like Canada, Japan, Australia and China have already changed their regulatory to keep their international students. 

Second, allowing these STEM students to offer effort and insight in working market will only bring positive influence to the whole U.S. market. As the STEM students are making contribution to the companies in the U.S., they are also making contribution to the real estate, automobile industry, service industry and all other industry, which will create thousands of jobs and increase employment rate. Humans themselves are a kind of resources in the market and STEM students are a valuable and irreplaceable component. 

Third, it is these F-1 students' right to get comprehensive training in work after academic study. To obtain a STEM degree is not easy. The process is both time and money consuming. Thus twelve-month training in industry is definitely not compatible with their effort they put before. 

In the end, I would like to ask for support from people who may concern to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.
