I fully support this decision. International students play an important role in economics. They work hard and bring great value to this country. It is true that there are unemployed citizens, but you cannot blame this on OPT students. It's not their fault for being better than some of the domestic worker and brining more value to both their employer and this country. If you are really good at what you are doing, nobody can take your job away from you. But if you are not, event if all the foreign workers are deported, you are still unemployed.
