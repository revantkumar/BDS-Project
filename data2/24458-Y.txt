I strongly support this proposal for the following reason.

First, this proposal will attract more talented people from the whole world to study and work in the U.S. If we can't offer a better opportunity for them, they will choose other countries such as Cannda, Japan and 

Second, competition is good for U.S in the long run. Globalization is non stoppable. We must let our citizen to get prepared for competitions from everywhere. We let them get prepared not by protect them from competition but encourage them to study and work harder.

Finally, diversity is always the core value of our nation. As a country built by immigrants, we are proud to be open to any people who are hard workers and want to realize their dreams here. They not only bring skills and knowledge, but also bring their courage and dedicating mind. U.S companies who want to set up business overseas also need their knowledge of their homeccountries to enter the markets.
