Highly skilled foreign workers will benefit US a lot since that can bring innovation and technology to the country. Without these immigrants, US will be a different country. We should keep them and not let these visa issue to kick them out. It is a country that is built and developed by immigration, and it should always be like that. I highly support the extension!
