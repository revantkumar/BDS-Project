The proposed rule from Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Training Program would be a detriment to 
American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow US companies to hire foreign citizens 
who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in US to artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs
in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. As a result this would put downward pressure on wages of all
tech workers. Furthermore the program actually incentivizes the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.
Immigration policy should serve in the interest of American workers not against it. America already lost her edge since
entering in the World Trade Organization and lost trillions of dollars in trade secrets to foreign countries.
