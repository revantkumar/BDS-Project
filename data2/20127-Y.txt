Expanding the STEM OPT will do NO HARM to AMERICANS and I strongly support it.
1. STEM OPT is only granted to HIGHLY SKILLED students with HIGH education. They jobs are not taken from the 10% unemployed Americans, who DO NOT OBTAIN THE NECESSARY skills for those jobs. On the contrary they are filling the working spots for which companies can't find enough SKILLED AMERICANS. Without the foreign OPT workers, those job will mostly likely be outsourced rather than giving to less skilled locals. STEM OPT is what keeps the job and also taxes in the country. 
2. Keeping highly educated students in the US is for the nation's good. No need to remind you how many great innovation are made by international scholars. Taking talents in not expelling them out is what makes US US.
