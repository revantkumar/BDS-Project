Akanksha Singh This regulation is very important for the students currently on OPT and those graduating and applying for OPT in near future. The STEM extension helps not only the F1 students to work in US but also helps the companies is maintaining their skilled task force. With the recent increase in the H1B visa applicants, a 24 month extension will help students like me to get more than one chance for the H1B application.
