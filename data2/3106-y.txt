Aazam Ghelani STEM OPT extension offers a chance to international students to practice their education and gain valuable practical experience of their academic training. I strongly support the extension. It does not cause any burden or competition to native employees as the number of students getting an extended stay under business visa is still the same. However, such an extension gives the students a valuable experience that puts them at an advantage when they go back to their home country.
