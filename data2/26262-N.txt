It is definitely wrong to even consider hiring an immigrant non-citizen, regardless of their training or expertise, when so many of our qualified citizens can and desire to work and provide for themselves and those depending on them. 
I wouldn't hire anyone that wasn't a citizen of the United States.
This is not right nor should you be wasting your time and our money, even considering doing this. Instead you all should be doing all within your power to keep illegal aliens OUT. 
This intrusion into our country needs to be stopped and that should be your primary and only concern.
Thank you for reading this as I definitely will be writing many letters, along with many of my friends, to have you busy doing something more constructive than helping those that are attempting to enter this country take our jobs for themselves. 
God bless you as you work and that you will be convicted that what you are doing is not patriotic when you get jobs for aliens and that it is WRONG!
