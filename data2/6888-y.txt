Sicheng He I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. This rule has been fully considered to make U.S more competitive without hurting the benefits of U.S citizens. 

The fully considered STEM extension rule avoids the possibility of hiring cheap labors or hurting the benefit of US citizens. According to rule USCIS E-Verify Employment Verification Program, STEM OPT extension would only be available to those students seeking employment or seeking to maintain employment with employers that are enrolled and in good standing in USCIS' E-Verify program. This already ensures that the salary levels of its employees are equal and fair, which prevents a company from hiring cheap labors. Additioanlly only STEM major students are allowed to extend their OPT period, which ensures that only those high tech and high intelligence related industries will be affected. As known to all, those industries need more competitive talents to remain competitive, or they wont be able to survive in this competitive world. 

Thus, the considerate OPT extension rule is not going to rob jobs from talent US citizens, it will only make US education system and high tech industries more cometitive.
