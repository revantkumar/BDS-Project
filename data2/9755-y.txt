Joseph Smerdel It is time you stopped supporting big business and began supporting American Citizens. What is the point of getting a STEM degree when our government continues to allow foreign workers to come and take our jobs. 

I worked in I.T. for a international company and I watched how they farmed out jobs to India. They hired them only because it would save the company money. The American workers were let go after they trained the foreign workers. I was involved in the hiring process and the American workers were more qualified, but too expensive so they give the jobs to Indians.

If you are an American then you should be working to get more Americans employed, not figuring ways to give our jobs to foreign works.

You wonder where the middle class is going, go look in the mirror, you are the problem.

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and

OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
