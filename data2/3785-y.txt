Jason L. Bradford Of course I SUPPORT this rule!! America is an open and accommodating country, many American citizens actually come from other countries, or their ancestors came from other countries decades ago. Like President Obama, his father comes from The Republic of Kenya. If we do not allow foreign intelligent people to stay here, what will the future of America like? America will lose hundreds of thousands of talented people!
