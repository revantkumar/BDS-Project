I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. OPT extension will make U.S. universities more attractive. International students are more willing
to come to the U.S. to pursue a degree because they have a better opportunity to train themselves
after graduation.

2. For STEM students, practical training is at least as equally important as on-campus education.
As a graduate student in Computer Science, I think it's extremely useful to get sufficient
industry experience after graduation. Only being exposed in real-world applications can the students
understand how to apply what they have learned, and how they can fill the gap between theoretical
education and real-world experience.

3. Many projects require more than one year to finish. I worked in the industry for more than one year, and
I also interned in U.S. companies. From my own experience, most projects require more than 12 months to
finish. This extension would give students more time to accomplish their objectives, and also help
companies make more profit.

4. Some American may worry about losing their job opportunities. I don't think this is true. Companies having
joined the e-verify program will assure that everyone has the equal opportunity, regardless their
citizenship. And I think this also cope with the very basic American spirit: this is a free country,
and everyone are born equal.
