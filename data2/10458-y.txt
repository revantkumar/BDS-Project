Jian Ren I'm writing to support this proposed new rule to enhance opportunities for non-immigrant students to further their courses of study through practical training. In-class course study can only be enhanced with enough practical training, especially for the courses in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Appropriate extension of the optional practical training (24 months) will be beneficial to both the US employers and the newly graduated non-immigrant students.
