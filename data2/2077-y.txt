Dong Liu I support the STEM OPT Extension.

I have read the documents, and believe that the extension of OPT will definitely help U.S high technology companies to enhance their edge in the following aspect:
1. Alleviate the engineer shortage in the high technology companies. As we know, one of the most powerful combustions for U.S economy is the innovation in high technology fields. While companies have a long-term concern to find enough qualified engineers, OPT extension can help to provide STEM students to take part in such innovation activities, to lessen the engineer shortage crisis.
2.Since to train a qualified engineer in STEM field needs a long time frame, normally more than twelve months, OPT extension is really necessary to help STEM students to get the required training.
3. STEM OPT extension does not introduce employment issue in the labor market. As we know, the high technology labor market is crowded with potential employers who want to get more and more engineers, even if they can look for STEM OPT students. With STEM OPT extension, they still will not hire people who don't have the STEM field knowledge/ skill set at all.

In all, STEM OPT Extension will enhance the U.S economy edge, while will not bring about any negative effects.
