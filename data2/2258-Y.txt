The opportunity to apply what I've learnt from school to actual work is the major reason why I rejected so many offers from top universities all around the world and decided to study in the America. We pay to study here not only to study from school but also expecting work and training experience. This period of working experience is crucial for a person's education and can greatly affect a person's competitiveness in job market. Also, many policies in China is favorable for oversea students if only they have 2 year working experience. 

If we don't have OPT extension, due to time lag in searching for a job, the actual time for people to work in industry is too short for gaining valuable working experience. Thus US education would become less competitive than others. Given that more and more US professors choose to go back to China. The research opportunities in Chinese Universities is also becoming more and more competitive. If not for the foreign working experience, I'd rather work and live in China or the UK than study here.
