Cindy Cao I support this proposal and I believe lengthening the period of OPT extension from 17 month to 24 month reflects the substance of the spirit of the States--- "more fair and more just".

President Obama announced on 11/20/2014 that he would give legal status and working permits to 5 million immigrants in the United States illegally. Meanwhile the government also has the will to increase the number of high-tech visas available, in order to attract more foreigners with high-tech skills traveling to the States. 

From my opinion, these two messages demonstrate the efforts that the government has been making to welcome all kinds of people in the States. Each American was once a stranger to the country, so this place could be so diverse today. Live, work and study are methods that foreigners spread culture influence on this continent, and create a more global friendly environment. 

Current trend of opening businesses such as startups involves so many students who want to achieve their dreams. And foreign students accounts for a big portion. There are tons of entrepreneurs out there could not make their dreams come true only because of their legal status. Plenty of good ideas and opportunities are dead, and I do not think legal status should be the reason stands in the way.

Please really takes some time to evaluate the advantages related to this proposal, and make a decision that benefits all.
