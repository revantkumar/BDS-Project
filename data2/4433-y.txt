Chuck Boiman As an American citizen it appalls me that you allow foreigners into this country to take our jobs. With so many unemployed Americans you'd think that our government would place American citizens first. Between foreign born workers, refugees, undocumented aliens, and legal immigrants pouring into this country we have too many foreigners in this US right now. If you are acting on the behalf of businesses requesting workers (which I think is the case) there's always on-the-job training for Americans. DON'T FAIL YOUR COUNTRY! A lot more is at stake than the need for workers. The American way of life, our values, our culture will erode into nothing. All of these people come here not to be Americans but to be a worker in another country. That's the difference between legal controlled immigration and bombarding millions of people in here is assimilation. Stop all people coming here unless it's done through the legal immigration process. You must stop what you're going to do. Don't bring anyone to our country and more importantly do your jobs and wipe clean this country of all it's illegals. 

Improve and Expand Training Opportunities for American legal persons with Stem Degrees and CapGap Relief for American Students. NOT F-1 Students. 

God Bless America. Put Americans first guys, please before it's too late.
