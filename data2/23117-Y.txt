I do agree that the abuse of OPT/H1B should be prohibited. However, only few students and companies are abusing, and any rush punishment or discrimination should be carfully considered, since these actions will be harmful to the rest, as well as this country. On one hand, it is necessary for new grads to be trained, for this is an essential part of education. On the other hand, this country also need such a good chance to attact talent students. About OPT/H1B abuse problem, there are many better solutions than just cancel this regulation.
