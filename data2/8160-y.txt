Michael Zweifel A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

How can you continue to rob the American elderly like this? You are bankrupting our social security and Medicare, which has been paid for by our elderly. 

Why is it that the US Government sees fit to BORROW from the Social Security and Medicare, when in fact the money is never paid back, THERE FOR ITS NOT BORROWING ITS STAELING? This is disgraceful and another reason the American voters are fed up with our government elected officials.
