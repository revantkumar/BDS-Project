I think OPT extension is definitely of great benefits to science, technology and the whole society! I have no idea why some people disagree with this extension. 

Look at the rising Internet market of China and other third world countries! International students learn so many skills and technologies in the USA. DO let them work here for a longer time in the USA. Cancellation of the extension will only speed up the development of counterpart countries! 

In addition, if OPT extension is passed, companies will have more students to choose from, which help these companies a lot in competition with others and making better products.

Those people who think OPT will make American people loses jobs are wrong. Qualified people can always find their jobs, under-qualified people won't. What should OPT extension blame for? Opportunities are only for hardworking and talented persons! Some guys just complaint about the new rules and have nothing to support their arguments, just STOP! Nobody like it.

If America is to be a great nation, take a step further and keep an open mind to people all over the world!
