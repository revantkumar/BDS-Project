I strongly support the stem opt extension proposal. I think a lot of people have already mentioned about the stem students are smart, they can create more wealth for US, the could create a lot of new job opportunities, and they actually do not compete with those US citizens who have similar skill set or knowledge. 

What I want to say is that a lot of stem majors are studied by foreigners now in US universities. For my example, I am a graduate student of master of Data Science. In this class, above 95% students are foreigners. This program is combined with computer science, Math and statistics, and business and it requires the students should have a lot knowledge and skills. The reason is that those US citizens who have part of these skills already have good jobs and they need not take this program or this program is too hard to a normal US citizen. If US government cancel the stem opt extension, those graduate student have no choice but only have to back to their countries, and then devote their energy and technology skills for their own countries. That is not good for US especially in the ear of Big Data.
