I am a PhD student here at United States, just graduated. 
I am currently in OPT, working for an e-verified company. 
I think the STEM extension is a fantastic program. 
First, It enables me to immediately apply the knowledge I acquired here at a U.S. University. 
Second, I am grateful for the opportunity to get practical training in a U.S company after graduation.
Every new job requires a learning and adapting process, the STEM extension actually allows me to make real contribution after the adapting process. 
Third, been able to focus on the work itself without worrying too much about the visa status is good.
Fourth, companies can also benefits from it, since they do not have to worry about the cost of training someone and losing them quickly.
Fifth, I think having more smart people contribute to the U.S companies will actually make them more competitive in the international environment. This in turn will make U.S economy stronger and create more job for american people.

In summary, I fully support the proposed rule of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students.
