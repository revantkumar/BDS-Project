I strongly support the new OPT rules for the following reasons.
1. Human resource is the most valuable assets in the 21 century. According to the CNN news(http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/18/pf/child-cost/) it will a middle-income couple just over $245,000 to raise child to the age of 18. And for those international student, most of them hold the Master or higher degree, they already spend a lot of the resources from the society, and now it's the time for them to return back to the world. These International student hold high degrees can definitely contribute a lot to the U.S. economy can making more opportunity to the world.

2. The population growth rate of the U.S. is low (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate). The U.S. is suffering Aging societies, the International student can help to decrease the side effect of aging societies.
