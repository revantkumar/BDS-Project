Anonymous I strongly support this new rule. The Mentor and training plan is very helpful and useful for those students who do not have internship experiences. They need this bridge period to enhance their professionals.

The same study found very few international students most of whom had bachelor's or master's degrees would like to stay in the United States permanently and are concerned about obtaining work visas. Another recent study, on the other hand, found about two-thirds of foreign-born doctorate recipients were staying in the United States 10 years after graduating.

Still, Stewart says even when international students return to their home countries it can be beneficial to the United States because they can serve as pseudo-ambassadors in the future who can help maintain ties with other countries.

"Having international students on our campuses helps globalize our campuses; it helps prepare American students for the world it is now," Stewart says. "Companies now are global. When you work on a team, you encounter people from all over the globe and need an education that prepares you for that."
