This policy beneficial for American people who are finding jobs. With the competitors, American guys will improve themselves and work harder to be better. As a result the industry will getting better and better. This is how America become the best these years. Cutting the competitors will decrease the energetic elements among American job hunters.

Also with this policy, there will be more International people study here, which contributes to our economy a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Really a lot. Few of them can get loan, and they pay higher education fees. They also buy things on Thanksgiving, at all kinds of shops. They live here and buy cars, eat food, rent apartments, travel around. They contribute a lot to our GDP. Cutting their OPT period will cause a huge damage to our economy and I don't want US to regret.

And instead of just protecting job opportunities, I support to improve American Education to make American students more competitive. This world is nature selective. Cutting the OPT period shorter will make our people weak and don't want to improve themselves anymore. Those well educated international students will go back to their home and make their countries better. Is this what we want? Cutting OPT period is not a wise long term strategy.

Also the OPT extension will bring more international people here. They bring their culture, their knowledge and their background here which make our society more diversified. Our people are also learning from them. 

So I support OPT extension. I really hope one day America is the best because it is really strong, not because it prevent others from growing.
