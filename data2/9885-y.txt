Xinwell Jahng I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

The high-end technology engineers and researchers are of significant importance for US companies, and also the whole US, to keep the leading status in the world. As known to all, vast majority of STEM majors in US universities are being taken by international students. Given the soaring development and great demanding of the jobs, international students won't be a threat to US citizens. To the contrary, foreign students are needed to supply employees for the related companies.

If the proposal cannot be passed, the expected results are: (1) foreign students have to go back to their motherland, where they can help the companies in their own country to lead the technology development, which may cause US to lose the leading status; (2) because of rare job positions, significantly less number of international students will come to finish their studies, and this will block the development of universities and also the jobs in related fields, such as food, car and tourist.

All in all, the proposal is of great benefits for US on both short-term and long-term.
