I totally support the propose that extend the STEM OPT to 24 months. As the American culture tells us that we are a equal country, we should try to provide equal opportunities to everyone in this country, regardless of the race, color, or nationality. The great country we have today is not only built by Americans ourself, but the people from all over the world. Just because we were open to different culture, different people, we became the greatest country in the world. Therefore, if we stop doing that and stop providing equal opportunities, we are on our way of stoping being the greatest country in the world. The people who are opposed to this propose are those who only see the interests at today and to themselves, but not the interests to this country at the future. From the views of economics, if we try to eliminate the STEM students of other country from getting jobs in the US, we are breaking the rules of free competition. And in the long term, it will only lower the competitiveness of our native students, and also have those students who learned their knowledges and skills in the US use those skills in the other countries. Therefore, I don`t see kicking all the foreign students out of the US is the best way to protect the native students or the American economy. I hope to see that the propose of extend STEM OPT to 24 months can pass!
