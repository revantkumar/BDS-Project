Wei Qiong Dear Officer,
This is Wei Qiong, I am a international student at Purdue University, I have been arrive at Unite State for 3 years. I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
(1) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; 
(3) the student's opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives. 

The opt extension is really good for all of us, it is win-win. Thank you for take your time.

Sincerely,

Rachel
