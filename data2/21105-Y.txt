one of the reason I came to United States is its freedom, varying from academic, working, statement, vote, etc. If you have a talent, no one can stop you on your way to success. I am in the second year of my Master program in university of washington, Seattle. Majoring in Electrical engineering, I've seen so many people, including myself, working hard to gain progress everyday, trying to make the world a better place to live, trying to make technology work better for human beings. No one can deny that technology is changing the world every day, this is not only because of intellegent people devoting themselves to career, but also the justifiable laws and policies allow them work with less concerns. working in a different country is always challenging, people have their rights to persue their dream and the lives they want to have. me, one of millions of international students, is hoping the freedom and equality can be taken seriously before making a decision. thank you.
