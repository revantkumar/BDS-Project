I Strongly Support this Regulation!!! I've seen so many vacant jobs available in NYC for Traffic Engineers. And nearly all American students in my Master's class have already got jobs. Without international students, these jobs won't be fulfilled!

I've seen so many Americans asking for reserving jobs for the local students. I do support this opinion. In fact, none of the companies I know intent to hire international students if they met the same quality American applicants. Cause they don't want to pay the H1b application fee and the lawyer fees for the international students!

Why don't give the companies which are seeking for labors one more option when not enough Americans could fulfilled in?
