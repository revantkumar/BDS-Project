This policy is really important. Most of the international students prefer Amaerican universities instead of other European ones because of the trainning period. The large amount money the international students pay for studying here really promotes American's economic development. If the STEM OPT extention is canceled, I am sure universities here will lose too many international students. Without the large sum of money coming from tuition, the development of science and economy of America will be affected seriously. 

For those opposers who mentioned that this action will decrease the opportunities for US citizens, I just want to clarify that it is reported that US citizens with a STEM background always have an employment rate over 90%. International students never reduce US citizens' chances for finding a job.

Moreover, it always takes more than 1 year for an entry-level worker to complete a whole project. So the extention will guarantee the real effectiveness of training. After OPT, most of those foreigners will go back to their countries. Again, since they will not stay in America permanately, this will never make US citizens' job market more fierce. 

In a word, the fact is that the foreigners pay a lot to Americans to study here, then work for them for like, 36 monthes, and then go back, remaining their contributions here, making American companies achieve more. US citizens should never worry about losing their job opportunities because of this reason. It is good for them. The future for Americans may come with more salary and less hard work, just because these foreigners.
