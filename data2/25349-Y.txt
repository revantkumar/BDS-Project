Being the founder of a US company that employs STEM graduates, I strongly support this proposal. My company works on cutting edge technologies which requires employees to have advanced training in STEM fields which can only be acquired with Master's or PhD degrees. There is a critical shortage of employees with such advanced skills in STEM. The STEM OPT program allows my company and other companies working in the high-tech sector to employ, train and retain outstanding STEM graduates of US Universities many of whom are foreign born. It is imperative that we provide such outstanding foreign born STEM grads a path to work in the USA post their graduation and use their skills for the growth of US companies which will overall have a positive effect on the US economy.
