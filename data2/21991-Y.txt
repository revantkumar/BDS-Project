I strongly support the extension of OPT for STEM students for the following reasons. 1. This extension will affect a great amount of employees who have been working for us company. Their work have been recognized by their employees. If they have to leave their jobs and this country simply because their citizenship, those companys will be the first direct victims. Great investment in training, education will be a waste, and they have to spend more time hopefully to find some alternatives. During this transition, the economic of US will be unstable and possibly some big company, would face severe challenges. 2. The STEM students often are the top students from other countries. If you are in a graduate program, you may know how excellent they are. Keeping them in US is a win but not a compromise. Actually US should try hard to keep them for your own benefits.
