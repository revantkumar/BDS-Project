Dani Zhou I strongly agree with OPT STEM Extensions Program. This will not only help international students get real working experience to work in US but also let employers have less costs to hire new employees and save more money and time to train them, which in return, employers have more budgets to hire more people and create more working opportunities, no matter for Americans or for international students. What's more, when international students have more time to adapt working environment in US, they are more likely to create more values in their work here, especially overcome the language problems. In one word, OPT Extension is definitely a great thing for both students and American employers.
