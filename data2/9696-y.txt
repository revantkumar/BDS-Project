Chengzhi Xing I stand for the 24 month extension. 

First, for the benefit for the states, many international students in STEM learned deeply in some industries. They could do the entry level job in these industry that might need better understanding about them. As far as I know, the demand of these professional entry level employees is still very high. 

Secondly, for the domestic employees. The international students would do that harm to these employees. I was told by an Indian student, to have a better chance for him to get working visa, he must do better than others. Meanwhile, the companies would pay them more than others. So it is a great challenge for them to find the right employers. 

Last, for the international students. Most of them graduate in May. The 24 month extension could guaranty them the third chance to apply for the lottery of working visa. The change to win might be a little lower, this still won't be that threat to domestic employees. 

So I believe the 24month extension will be a win-win-win solution.
