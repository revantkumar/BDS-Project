Yang Du I strongly support the proposal of improving and expanding OPT for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. A lot of noble person who achieved success in America were international students.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition can help american select elites.
