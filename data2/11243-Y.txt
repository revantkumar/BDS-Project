I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 

Actually, not only my classmates but also many of our professors come from all around the world. They are such brilliant people doing such amazing works! Elites study here, stay here and work for America and make the countries stronger. That is how it works. Without OPT, those people will work for other countries, contributing to scientific fields and GDP,and also create thousands of job opportunities. 

Yes! They will provide job opportunities rather than compete for job opportunities with natives. 

And without STEM students all around world, companies may not be able to employ sufficient employees to do this kind of job!

In a word, this proposal will benefit America and relevant companies a lot!
