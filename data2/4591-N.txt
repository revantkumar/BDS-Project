We need to take care of our own citizens here in the US first!!!! We now have only 58.1% of all Americans working,the lowest since WW2,there are 17 million Americans wanting to find full time jobs but can't and 47% of all Americans are now gov. dependent,the most in our history.Our citizens here should be given the chance to fill these jobs first!!!!
