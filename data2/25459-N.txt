I urge you to reject the DHS's proposal that would expand the Optional Practical Training Program that would allow U.S. tech 
companies to hire foreign students at lower wages for 3 years. This is ludicrous because it relieves them from having to pay
the wages here in the States and avoid any Social Security taxes. There are plenty of our own students having difficulties in 
finding work in these fields and there is no reason to put our own citizens aside for foreigners. Stand up for America and
jobs for them instead of politics and lower pay for those who are foreigners.
