Alex Walker sorry I forgot some details on my previous comment.

STEM students have been contributing the U.S. since the immigration opened back in the 20th century.

One STEM student funded Google.

The other one funded Yahoo.

Another one invented Instagram. And he cannot get H1-B draft.

All of them are trained by the U.S.. And if you kick them out back in their country, the only thing they will do is to fight against the U.S. in industry. I am wondering if you guys take that into consideration.

The STEM area in the U.S. is week enough without the support from international graduates. No offence, but some native students even cannot to the calculation 0.33 * 100 / 25 without calculator. Also, the Olympics Math, as you can see, are all Aisan American.

12 + 24 months OPT means three years. Employers in the U.S. can have more time to train, evaluate and learn from fresh graduates. How much time did you spend start dating to marriage? Why you care so much before you get married? Because if things do not work out anymore and there is going to be a divorce, both parties will lose a lot. Same here. No companies want to train someone and let them leave after 12 months. However, they do not want to sponsor someone who they will fire in 2 years.

This extension gives a very good opportunities to create a win-win situation. I don't care the opponents' ideas unless they can do a better job than us. Take a look of peer reviewed articles and count the authors. Most of them are international folks.

I am not saying the local students are not that good. But in STEM, that is the trend, and like it or not, that is the truth. Unless you want those talents to fight against you using the training you provided to them, you better support this bill.
