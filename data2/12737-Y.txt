I'm in favor of expanding STEM period for F1 students for several reasons. 
First, it benefits American economy since F1 students are more hard working. It is obvious F1 students treasure more the opportunity to learn in US and will do better in their acedemic life. Thus they're more creative and productivy to make contribution to the US society if they can work for a longer time. 
Second, if the policy put into act, it will attract more students to come to US and study. This also brings a lot benefits to culture communication, tourisim development. 
Third, it benefits the company who hires F1 students. They may have business connection with their hometown and bring more ideas and opportunities.
