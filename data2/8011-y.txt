Pradeep Kumar Gurunathan For any country to progress, there needs to be a proper set-up where STEM areas are encouraged and motivated. The world is moving towards automation, and the number of blue-collar jobs are declining by the day, while the number of white-collar jobs are increasing. To balance the demand and supply, it is imperative that any country must open-up viable opportunities for jobs, as well as human-resources for these jobs. If this extension is not imposed, it would lead to the loss of talent to other countries. Losing home-bred talent to foreign countries would lead to disastrous consequences, as thousands and millions of tax-payers' money has been spent in nurturing the talents of these foreign individuals.

It is my strong belief that in the longer run, the country stands to benefit a lot by letting the home-grown talent stay within the country and boost the economy.
