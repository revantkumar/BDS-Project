I strongly support the STEM extension.
First, I have seen those STEM worker reinforce the high-tech power over others countries.
Second, lots of STEM students are very clever and undoubtedly great talents. Not just U S, even all countries need them.
Third, I have seen Silicon Valley in lack of talents. STEM extension will save Silicon Valley.
