I strongly support OPT extension for the following reasons:

Some opponents argue that it will be more difficult for U.S. citizens to find a job. This is totally wrong. The number of U.S. citizens who are majored in science and mathematics is not enough at all. I am a first year graduate student at math department of UW-Madison. Less than half of the first year students are Amercians. Moreover, some of them will be no longer interested in math a few years later. So they will quit the graduate programs. There will be no adequate mathematicians and scientists if the country asks those foreigners to leave. OPT extension offers opportunity for these people to work for the country for three years which will bring a lot of benefits for U.S. citizens.

I want to ask a question about those who oppose OPT extension: Are you good at math or science? Can you do these jobs for the country?
