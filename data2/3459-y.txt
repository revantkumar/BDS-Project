Neil Mackay International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. Expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Raytheon Chairman and CEO William Swanson said at a Massachusetts' STEM Summit last fall, "Too many students and adults are training for jobs in which labor surpluses exist and demand is low, while high-demand jobs, particularly those in STEM fields, go unfilled.". Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
