The Federal Government is getting out of hand. There is no good reason for the Administration to be extending the time allotment of this program. 

I am against this regulatory change.

Per Sen. Charles Grassley, "By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 yearsthe same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be validthere is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."
