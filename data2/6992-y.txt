Nisha Shrestha The new change in F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months is an extremely welcoming decision that should be implemented as soon as possible. I strongly believe that the practical training not only benefit international students to explore and utilize their education but at the same time would contribute significantly to this nation's economic. Therefore, I FULLY SUPPORT this new change of F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months.
