I strongly support this new rule because of the following two reasons:

First, it makes US stronger. these talented foreign students contributed their knowledge and wisdom to boost the science and tech industry which will keep make U.S. ahead of any other countries like before. Otherwise, these students will return back to other countries which will compete with U.S. and keep U.S. fall behind some other countries.

Second, it is beneficial for the american. these talented students boost these STEM industry so much that there is always a lot of position for the American to fill in, which guarantee most American majoring in STEM will be fully employed as long as they have the skills.
