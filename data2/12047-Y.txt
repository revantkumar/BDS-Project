Great thanks to The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for this proposal. I am a student with STEM degree. It will be quite helpful for me to find a proper employer when I finish my study with an extension of 24 years. I really want to have a opportunity to learn more in US companies before I return to my country. Sometimes because of the limitation of international students, the opportunities are quite small. I can really have a smooth development in my career if the 24 months OPT extension can be carried out.
