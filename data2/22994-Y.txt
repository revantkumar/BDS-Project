I grown up in a small town in China. When I left the town for higher education, I got the highest academic score among 400 kids of my age(Yes, there were that many of them). Now I am the only one, among those kids, working and studying here in the U.S.. 
Most foreign students are like me, one out of hundreds. We are hired here because we are special, the firms need us, the talents that might be much harder to find inside this country alone.
Our being here is pose thread to some individual's jobs. But over all, we will make huge contribution to the U.S. economy and technology.
