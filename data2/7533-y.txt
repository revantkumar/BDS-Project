Venkatesh Nagam I support this 24 month opt period strongly butI would request you to make this regulation as 36 month opt period, so that students have enough time to get practical knowledge...Also, I feel that the extra work imposed on employee is not that appreciable because there might be chances that they(employees) feel risky and time consuming. We indirectly affect our practical work opportunities....Hope, a good, student friendly and employee friendly rule will be finalised.
