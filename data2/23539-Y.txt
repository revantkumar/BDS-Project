I fully support this motion as this allow international student to contribute to resources of USA. If these students were sent home, this will mark a significant brain drain for the US govt. International students are able to to provide the knowledge and determination as they seek to grow further and learn more from US companies. This benefits both the US companies as there are currently not enough IT resources in this country. By contributing to the US IT industry, this allows the USA to be at the forefront of technological IT innovation which would allow the US to be the greatest country in IT. These benefits all citizens of the USA as in the long run, this will allow greater job creation as the company grows with the students. The STEM extension would most definitely be a pathway for foreign students to contribute back what knowledge that they have learn from all the great IT universities. Thank you for giving all international students this opportunity
