I strongly support the this proposal. I am a computer science graduate student from China. I came to U.S. for its education quality and intern opportunities. 12 + 24 months mean more systematic training for me. Without the extension, it is likely that companies will stop recruiting international students for projects that take long time. This is harmful to the high tech companies too. Over 90% students in my university are from abroad, they all are smart students who can make solid contributions to the industry. That would be a shame if they are forced to leave U.S. after study.
