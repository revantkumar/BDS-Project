I strongly support this STEM OPT policy. And I don't agree with some comments saying that international students will take U.S. citizens' job opportunities. I have the following reasons:

1. International students who work with OPT extensions are most commonly involved in the engineering/science industry. They are generally in a position that requires higher education. This leads to significant contribution to the economy and tech industry. Ultimately, it will generate more job opportunities and benefit local U.S. citizens. 

2. Most of the higher-educated international students are supported by national fundings, e.g. NSF, DARPA etc. Our government spends huge amounts of tax payer's money to support education in order to let students make contribution to the nation. If we don't have STEM OPT Extension, how can those talented international students' income tax back our nation? 

3. Most of the OPT holders are from Asian countries, like China and Japan. These countries are extremely eager to have these International students come back to make contributions. If we don't have OPT and force them go back to their mother lands, we are helping the COMPETITOR countries. 

Therefore I strongly support this policy.
