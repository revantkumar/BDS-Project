Suresh Kari Although I am a former f1 student who availed opt-stem extension, I disagree with the 24 month extension. Any half measures to fix skilled migration will be dangerous and highly polarising. Instead of present rule, uscis can give a opt period of 5 years for stem students and facility to apply directly for permanent residency. This will cut out manipulation by software consultancy firms, who are nothing but full of greedy people. Another thing to do simultaneously would be to drastically cut H1 work visa program from 85000 something to around 20000 or 30000 but exclusively for US-trained students. 

This comprehensive measure will cut out manipulation by middlemen companies, corner-cutting by US companies.
