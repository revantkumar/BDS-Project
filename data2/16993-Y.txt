I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Internship opportunities are one of the most significant reasons to attract international students. Failing to pass this bill would definitely result in a dramatic decline in the amount international students in the future.
2. U.S. does need international STEM student to improve its innovative competence
3. Yes, international students will compete with domestic students, but competition is good thing. In fact, it is the existence of competition that has made U.S. so strong.
4. U.S. needs diversity, especially in STEM fields. Actually, a majority of talents who made great achievements in STEM fields are once international students.

To sum up, U.S. should continue embracing the diversity in talents and welcoming international students to make contributions to U.S.
