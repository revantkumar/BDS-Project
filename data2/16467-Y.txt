It was about time we make the immigration laws a little easier at least for students. After all they do not get special discount at these universities, they have to pay non residents tuition. Let them stay here after graduation. Immigrants (legal and illegal since we have so many of the illegals ones at this time are NOT taking jobs from the American people or those who came here legally - Look at the faces of those working behind the counters at the fast food, what nationalities do they look like - yes some of them we can guess their origin). Yes we are a nation under rules, but also a nation under God. Aren't we!
