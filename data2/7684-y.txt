Huilian Huang I believe that a lot of companies are willing to hire STEM international students because they are talented and they can contribute to the company. Actually those companies need to pay more to hire an international student than hire a native, because they need to pay the H1B application fee and they risk losing this employee in case of he/she can not get H1B and have to go back to his/her own country. 
What's more, if the companies can grow faster with all those talented international employees, there's no doubt that US economy also can grow faster. This will contribute to the whole company.
So as long as all companies give the equal pay to the foreigners as that given to citizens, STEM extension definitely won't undermine the citizens' chances to find a job.
