Mason Timmerman As a high tech employee,I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the team.

3. Competition does not exist, they share the same salary
