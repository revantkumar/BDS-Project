We international students pay premium tuition to get an education here, and deserve a payoff, and an American dream, as well. The companies in U.S. will also benefit from the brightest and hard-working international talents. 

It does not make sense at all to say that the international students are causing them to lose jobs. And yes, international students are taking jobs, but we are also creating more opportunities and motivating the development of IT, financial and many different areas. This kind of competition is absolutely a good contribution to the industries by letting international students have opportunities to work here.
