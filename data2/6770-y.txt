Joe Ye As an employee working in silicon valley, I do job interviews every week and I do see the demand from STEM related job positions are so big that we don't have enough qualified domestic human resources. We need qualified and US-trained international STEM workers to the meet the need of the rapid industrial growth of the US.

US citizens should also be encouraged to get STEM related education/training to be more competitive in job market, but foreign STEM students have very little impact to usual American workers at the moment as we are still short of workforce in STEM related industries.

Therefore this new OPT program will do no harm but to help US economic growth. It will also encourage more US citizens to devote themselves into a promising high tech career.
