I am tired of foreign students being given preference over US citizens. Both of my daughters graduated from excellent universities with degrees in Environmental (Cornell) and Mechanical (Boulder, CO) Engineering. Neither were able to find summer internships. It took the Cornell graduate almost a year to find a full time position. She was not being selective and had a long list of achievements and leadership awards. The younger daughter was also unable to find a full time position in this country and has opted to use her UK citizenship (courtesy of her father, a UK citizen) and move to England, where she got a job within a month. I have other examples of US citizen engineering graduates unable to find positions. Yet, living in the Seattle area and walking near Microsoft and Amazon headquarters the vast majority of people I see are Indian and Asian, speaking a heavily accented English or in Chinese - these are NOT native born individuals. Until there is truly a shortage of STEM graduates, there should NOT be an effort to make it easier for foreigners to stay/work here. Instead, the timeframe they are allowed to work in this country should be reduced. Ideally, they would get their degree here and then return to their country to improve it. From what I understand, companies are hiring foreign nationals because they are cheaper which results in depressed wages for others, are willing to work ridiculously long hours, and not "make waves". These are not character traits that will make this country strong and dynamic but will enrich American executives - to the detriment of the US children, raised with American values and work/social ethics. I have no interest in living in China or India, but feel like that's were I'm headed due to the huge influx of foreign nationals. Encourage companies to hire American and remove the incentives to hire foreign.
