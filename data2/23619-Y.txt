Hiring markets are really not stable these days. Besides, international students still need a good luck to get h1b visa. Imagine, you finally hire a great employee when fight with any possible hire freezing due to the market changes. After all the tough training and spend, he needs to go back due to the reason he has no h1b and no F1 opt. That will increase huge of troubles to the working team and hiring team. YOU ARE WASTE OF YOUR OWN LABOR AND MONEY. What will happen? Yes, company would't like to hire international students anymore. Then, international students wouldn't like to study here. We will lose a bunch of tax income which should be from their tuition fee and life spend.

Again, the against policy will show up in the other country. We are in a really world which means we are not alone. Any block policy will generate really bad influence which you really can't imagine. If China block us, do we can have some good results? They forbidden to provide any needs of our product. We are in the same boat. We need the best people to deal with the tough things. That is it.
