I strongly support the OPT extension. Normally, funds for projects would lasts for three to four years. If an international students are in this project but cannot continue because of this visa issue, it would be a big loss for the company. International employee in our tech company are doing great jobs and very outstanding. They deserve better and should feel secure about their status so that they would perform even better.
