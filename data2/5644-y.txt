Vamsi Krishna (2nd Comment) I have recently completed my Mater from a very good university. I've been trying for job from months. There are many job position that I have submitted and everybody is asking for long duration work permit in USA. It is very difficult to get a job with just 1 years of OPT period. Even though I get the job I'm not sure that my H1B application will be picked in the lottery system. 

Where as there are numerous job positions and USA needs resources to fill those positions. I want to work for a few years where I can show and develop my skills. It will be of no use for my Masters degree that we took if we are not able to work in USA.

I strongly support the rule to Improve and expand Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees.
