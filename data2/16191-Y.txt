I support.

I think most international students come here for graduate degrees and PhDs, later they become scientists, researchers, professors, etc. So actually they are not in the job market where the unemployment happens. The research field, high-tech field are short of talents, both American students and international students. 

Studies show that many research universities spend more than 70% of their research funding supporting international graduate students, simply because there aren't enough American students wanting to pursue their graduate degrees in STEM fields. If these international students go back to work for their home countries, that means we are wasting research funding on other countries, such as China, mid east countries.

On the other hand, if we don't keep these highly educated STEM students here to work for us, America will be weaker and weaker in the global competition of high-tech, research, etc. I don't think we want that happen.
