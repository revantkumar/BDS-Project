I would say that I strongly agree with the new rules assigned by DHS this time. The reasons are quite obvious and straight forward. 
For governments, the benefits are HUGE. First, they will receive more tax and fees from the employers with longer time. Second, the students would drive the economy locally in various ways in this case. Once the student get a good pay job, they will spend on the foods, living purchases, renting or buying the houses, cars, and even traveling.
When we look back in the history, the international workers always dedicate a lot to the economy since the United States is built. And it is also known that the US is a country build up on immigrants from the very beginning in 1776.
Finally, I would like to state again that I strongly agree with the new rules!
