Roger Curtiss I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix. It is time to take care of Americans, not foreign workers.
