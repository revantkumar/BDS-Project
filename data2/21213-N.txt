The Homeland Security program to expand the OPT program is a slap in the face of all American citizens and should be canceled. It Is spitting in the face of all unemployed Americans and should not and i believe will not be tolerated by the American citizens. I my self strongly oppose this new reg. and i think it should be thrown in the trash basket along with our non-President Obama and Homeland Security Officials who have proven by their defacto disregard for the Tax Payers and all American citizens. The bible teaches us that charity begins at home which i know and understand that Mr Obama and all his Departmental Officials don't read nor do they believe in Christianity. Mr Obama claims he is a christian , if he is so is Satan. I for one believe that actions speak louder then words and his speaks Islamic. American workers have a hard enough time finding good jobs without bringing thousands more foreign workers in and giving corporate welfare to companies to hire them instead of American workers who will require them to pay in their half of Social Security. If you Political bigots can't do right by us the American citizen then get the hell out of Washington and let someone fill your positions that care for us the Citizens of this nation.
