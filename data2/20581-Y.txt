It is important for us (STEM) students to have a legal right to obtain a longer time for professional working in America.

1. For Grad students, we are studying in the same field as our undergrad do, but there are lot of details in each major different from what it is in our countries. For example, I am studying structural engineering in US, the design and construction standard here is very different from my country (China), and if I have a longer time working here, it should be much better for me to reinforce my specific professional skill in practical way.

2. International student has lots of restrictions in US, like limited working hours, actually, we pay much more money the US students for studying here (both living expenditure and tuition fees). We are actually facilitating the process of bettering US economy, since we spend more extra money here, and can provide professional skills in US, which can also bring to GDP of US an increment.

3. American is a mute-cultural country, which means, by definition, it should be more easy to adapt people in different countries to life here. Also, Chinese and students in other Asian countries are competitive, to study, work and life with us, I believe that US will be a much strong country than it predict to be.
