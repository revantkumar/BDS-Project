I have worked in Information Technology (IT) for nearly twenty years in multiple jobs. I the last ten years I have seen opportunities for US citizens disappear as large US companies seek to drive down wages by off-shoring and hiring foreign workers. I have seen my American colleagues laid off as workers based in India and China have taken their jobs. From my own experience, I don't believe that there is a lack of IT workers in the US. It is corporate greed that is driving this agenda.
