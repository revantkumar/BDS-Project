Silei Peng I strongly support this decision in extending the OPT of F1 student visa.
I'm a Chinese student studying IT at Bentley University, Massachusetts. 
This is my second year in the United States and I really enjoyed the past year in the US. US is really a great country especially for its culture diversity. I get to know the people from Europe, Latin America and also our Asian siblings. None other countries has an environment nurturing and embracing this receptive and welcoming atmosphere here in the United States. OPT which enables international students to work in the United States after graduation, without doubt, would further make this diversity more vigorous and expanding. For the sake of this unique cultural diversity of the United States, the DHS should not call off the OPT extension. 
Additionally, I personally do not think this extension gives the international students employment priority over local students. From where I see, more than 80% of positions on our school career website is for citizens and green card holders only. This can be a side show of the fairness of the employment. Looking at the career fair at our school and at Boston, most companies do not welcome F1 student visa holder as well. Given the situation that international students has the advantage over local people. Cancelling the extension would put our international students into a worse stage in employment.
Last but not least, international students receiving the world first-class education here not only pay large amount of tuition fee which is contributing to the US education industry, but also make great values after graduation for the companies in a large diversity of fields ranging from technical to fine arts etc. International students to some extent play a critical role in making the US leading role in the technical field in our world today. Considering this great amount of profits to the universities and companies here, the DHS should retain the OPT extension.
