The OPT program and the extension is necessary for the U.S. economy and innovation. Currently, the unemployment rate is at a record low level. Most Americans can find a suitable job in the job market. STEM F-1 students who are looking for a job in the U.S. only count for a very small portion of the total labor force. However, STEM F-1 students stand for a large portion of work force in both high-tech and research institutions. They are contributing to the U.S. economy and technology improvement. Without expanding training opportunities, the only consequence is not improving job market for Americans, but damage America's leadership position in technology and economy. Therefore, it is very necessary for Department of Homeland Security to expand training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees.
