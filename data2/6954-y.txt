Dingjiang Zhou I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The students who learned knowledge from the U.S. universities should stay and make contributions to the U.S.;
2. Competition is not a bad thing, think about an environment there doesn't have any competition, will anyone work harder? Only competition will make the U.S. better and better;
3. 24 months extension is very good for students who are establishing their own companies and starting their own business, one year of OPT is just too short to do so. With the new born companies, there will be new job opportunities as well.
