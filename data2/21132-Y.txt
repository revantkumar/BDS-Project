I strongly support extending the STEM OPT period to 24 months. I believe that these students asking for the extension are people who we would want as productive/active members of our society. They are hardworking, dedicated, and enjoy their studies. I have studied and currently work with people facing the struggle of needing an OPT extension that will give them enough time to find a stable job and help contribute to our society. These are good people who have done nothing wrong and have followed the rules and are deserving of this 24 month extension.
