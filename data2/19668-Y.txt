Hello there,
I'm a foreign student in U.S, and I honestly support the OPT extension, not only for international students like myself, but also for the profound development of America. I always trust that U.S. is a friendly, united and diverse country, which is exactly why she is so charming. I hate unfair society, discrimination and vicious competition. Only a country is open to the outside, the opinion and people with various background, can this country be going on a prosperous way. In fact, I don't think giving chances for foreign students to work in U.S is a bad idea at all, because good competition makes people better than they think they could be. 

There is no reason to fear the competition, unless this country is lack of confidence. We are not monsters, and we are not overthrowing anything. We just want to have a life that efforts could be made to gain a fair result. Keep welcoming foreign talents is a great way to circulate the labor market, and as "STEM" majors indicate, all these hard-working, talented people will only be serving in the scientific or application area, with minimum potential to enroll in the political conflict. Pushing powerful yet harmless group is very ridiculous, and U.S is not gaining anything by assigning those job opportunities to unqualified people. 

A powerful country should be confident. That's very, very important.

Thanks.
