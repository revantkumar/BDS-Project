Because the original purpose of helping foreigners get schooling and return to their home countries has now failed and foreign students use OPT to stay here illegally, the program needs to be dismantled.

The illegality and the unconstitutionality of OPT has been proven because only foreign students are eligible and American students are never allowed to use the program. 

Who is paying for OPT? Americans--not foreigners. How can this possibly help our Country? It doesn't. It's time to quit financially providing for foreigners and start helping Americans. 

Another glaring problem is that the DHS doesn't know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in our Country. How many of these foreigners are terrorists? And why doesn't someone try to find these people? There are obviously too many ways for foreigners to be fraudulent and no one is holding them accountable. This is very unnerving for Americans that love our Country and want to feel safe wherever we go.

Also companies should be held accountable for hiring foreigners--especially illegal foreigners. Foreigners don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under OPT and, of course, they can be hired at a lower rate than many Americans because they are younger and willing to work for less.

It's time for Americans to stand up for America and stop all programs that are anti-American and hurt our economy and thus our Country. DO NOT expand OPT and dismantle this program NOW!
