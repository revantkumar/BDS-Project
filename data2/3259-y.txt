John Smith OPT extension is pretty good for the guys with needed skills to stay here, H1B visa is not guaranteed for higher educated guys to stay here because it is like a lottery, if we kick off the research and skilled guys because of the visa status, it will be controversial with our culture and harmful for the United States. Everyone is created equal, we should give them opportunities, with the extension, we will get the guys we needed, and the guys with needed skills will contribute to our economy, it will be a win-win.
