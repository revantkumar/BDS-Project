I strongly support the proposal that improves and expands training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees.

I work in the semiconductor industry. This is a $336 billion industry to the US economy and it has been steadily increasing year over year. To help the US semiconductor companies stay competitive in this brutally competitive global environment, the US government needs to make it easier for the US semiconductor companies to acquire the best talents in the world, not making it harder. Thus, an expansion of training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees is essential.
