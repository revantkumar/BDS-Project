Since the recent rise in total number of applicants for H1B work visa,almost two thirds of students in the STEM field are denied H1B by the lottery. Under these circumstances if OPT for STEM is not extended then these students will not be able to work in US anymore. The impact of this huge workforce going back to their home country will devastate the rising tech industry in the US and will hinder the progress this country is making in science and technology.
