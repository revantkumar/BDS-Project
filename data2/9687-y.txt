Adam McGrath International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 50% - from US$4.4 trillion in 2012 to US$6.2 trillion. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.
