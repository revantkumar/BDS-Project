Lynn Wan I fully support this OPT extension proposal. More than about 80% of the graduate students in the United States are international students, many from China, India and Europe. There is even the saying that Chinese researchers form the brain of America. If the laws and regulations keep being so difficult for the talented international graduates to stay in the States, America is going to lose even more competence on the global stage. The 21st century is about talents and globalization. Passing regulations which assist keeping the talents in the US is the key of better economy and advanced technological inventions. It is consistent with the American dream, in which everyone has equal chances and equal rights. Some say this proposal might harm the American people by giving job opportunities to foreign talents instead of the locals, while the opportunities are reserved for the most qualified people, in spite of where the people come from. Plus many immigrants opened their own businesses and opened more job vacancies for the locals. There is an interesting fact that, in every big city, the majority of the most successful people are from somewhere else. Now it is time for Americans and immigrants to shake hands, work together and make it a better world.
