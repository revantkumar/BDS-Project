This is a great proposal. I've known a lot of advanced degree students (those with PhDs in STEM) who had to leave the US after their OPT expired and before they had success at winning the H1B lottery. This is very disruptive to both the employer and the students. In addition, the US will lose countless brilliant STEM scientists whom it trained and funded for 6-7 years. I hope this proposal will be passed!
