I really love this extension of OPT period for STEM students!! I can't think of any reason to object it. The openness and opportunities are factors of the US that attract so many excellent people around the world here and allow them to contribute to the society. I don't understand why there are some people regard this extension as harmful to US citizens. They already have advantages over foreigners concerning employment, this extension won't change anything for them. Meanwhile it improves the fairness of competition and is really good for economy.
