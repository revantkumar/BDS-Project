As international students, the major reason for choosing higher education in US rather than UK, Australia and other countries is the OPT and OPT extension allow us to find job in US after graduation. It is really important to practice what we learned throughout graduate studies by finding a job in US. The US leading companies related to STEM degrees can help international students gain more skills and make them more competitive when they return to their own countries. If the 24-month OPT extension policy is approved,there is no doubt that the US universities will attract more international students and that can boost the US economy. Without OPT extension policy, the US will definitely lose a great amount of international students.
