By hiring foreign students, corporations are not paying 7.5% into the federal coffers for each paycheck. This means ONE BILLION DOLLARS shortfall for Medicare and Social Security programs PER YEAR. This bill is a shadow bill launched by the President to circumvent the wishes of Congress and the wishes of many citizens. Existing taxpayers/workers are training immigrants to take their jobs. I.E Disney World.

The proposals are presented as humanitarian, yet buckles to corporate interests over the needs of seniors who paid into a system all of their lives. There is little if any training going on in these corporations. It is all about cheap labor. The students are supposedly going back to their native countries to spread their knowledge. Oh please, do you really belief this malarkey for a moment? Sounds like a bad used car salesperson. 

Many immigrant students on work visas overstay. Some apply for citizenship or just blend in without paying into the system. However, they use our social services and medical systems that they never paid for. Great deal for them. Lousy deal especially for seniors that have waited a lifetime to feel a little more secure. MILLIONS 60+ lost their jobs during the great recession. Just another scam and an end run to hide the truth.

My biggest mistake ever was voting for Obama. He is acting like a King, not a President. Biggest sell-out of American workers ever. I want my country back. There will be a wave of former Democrats voting Republican next year do to this favoritism. Why is it that foreign workers have an extra advantage over citizens that built the system that they so much are taking advantage of? 

I am STRONGLY against immigrant bashing. But I believe everyone should wait in line for citizenship and quit asking for, and getting, a special advantage. Fairness used to be the American way. Now we expose ourselves as saps to the world. Human nature takes over and the abuse begins. We don't have the money anymore. PLEASE WAKE UP!!!
