I pretty agrees with this new rule because of the following reasons:

(1) Current situation should agrees with this change. More and more STEM students are applying for h1b right now, which makes it much harder to be chosen than a few years ago when 17-month extension came out. So I think it is reasonable to change that old rules and extend OPT time to 24 months based on current trend.

(2) We international STEM students make a grate contribution to American engineer field. This can be proven by the percentage of international students and works in STEM field both in industrial field and on campus. What impact will be if more than half of us have to leave this country because of the reclaim of STEM extension rules? Do you think places like silicon valley can still function well?

(3) We have already sacrifice a lot to achieve STEM degrees so we deserve better. Not to say other degrees are easier but we STEM students do spend more of our times on endless homework and projects. We even need to sharp our skills during leisure times. Otherwise we may not get a good GPA because the tests are so hard. These takes us too much times on finding a job or an intern. So we need more time after we graduate to make up the lost time.

(4) We STEM need more time to gain experience in industry field. For STEM students, if you want to do a good job in industry, you have to spend hours and hours for practicing in real industry. Only after that, can we really improve ourselves. That is why this new extension is so important to us. We need more time to become qualified for our field, and that is the reason why we need this extension.
