The Homeland Security Division's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau is just one more act that emphasizes the Presidents plans to totally dismantle our country and shove his Islamic practices down the throats of all the United States citizens. I find it hard to believe that there are no seated Representatives or Senators who have the guts to stand up to this ruler and tell him "That's enough". Hopefully the voting public will handle the problem for them in the 2016 elections and reclaim the United States of America for the God fearing country that it was founded to be.
