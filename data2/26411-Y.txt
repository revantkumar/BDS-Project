American citizens are woefully unemployed in the STEM fields. I personally know many qualified American citizens who cannot obtain employment in STEM fields due to "alleged" lack of jobs. No student (STEM or not) with a visa should be given any training opportunities beyond a college or technical degree in any way, shape, or form. Foreigners should return to their own countries for additional training.
