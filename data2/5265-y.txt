X. Han I support this extension regulation. Let me share an idea from my research advisor. Because it's not easy to train her student from a beginner to a productive senior graduate student. Also, she wants to get more publications relying on her senior graduate students' work. So, that's why my advisor is always trying to keep her graduate students to work for her as long as she can. I think, no matter in academic or in industry, the logic should be similar. After two or five years higher education, it is the time to gain from all these students in STEM major. If OPT with 24 months extension regulation is approved, it will benefit to all people in USA.
