Dear Congressmen,

AS A REGISTERED VOTER, I feel it is irresponsible to our young people to bring an influx of foreign workers to the United States. 
Those graduating High School and College have "Dreams" of their own in becoming dependable, knowledgeable, 
constructive citizens of our country. When your decision (vote) to increase the foreign workers in number or
length of the work visa only sends a message that you do not care about our young adults' future.

DO NOT ALLOW PASSAGE OF ANY BILL THAT WILL REMOVE THE FUTURE PROSPECTS 
OF EMPLOYING THE YOUNG ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES!

Sincerely,
Paula Walter,
Yuma, AZ
