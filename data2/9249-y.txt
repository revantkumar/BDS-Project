S. Joyce I am opposed to allowing foreign students to remain in the US after graduation. It is bad enough but these for nationals took spots in American colleges away from American students, and what is already an extremely competitive situation domestically. In fact, it is a sin. 

For decades the United States has kept the mantra that a college degree in a stem field is absolutely necessary to competing in the 21st-century economy. However, now our own government is working against our own American students to flood the job market with for nationals to compete for those stem jobs. The idea that there is a shortage of these kinds workers is ludicrous. The percentage of students in stem fields who actually get a job in their area of study is shockingly low. It is time that the American government works for the benefit of the American people, not for nationals. Foreign students should take their skills and leave the United States, and allow their countries to benefit so that their people won't choose to flee their country and continually flood the United States with more for labor, both skilled and otherwise.
