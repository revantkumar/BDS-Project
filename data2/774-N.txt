Why are we worried about people out side of this country getting the jobs here before American graduates. My brother spends most of his time in India finding them and bring them back to the U.S. to fill the jobs that could be filled here with American stem Graduates. There is some thing wrong when you fight to get the Government to look for American workers yet they seem to try to hide the fact that there is no lack of people in this country to fill the jobs.
I am so sick with this government doing what they want instead of what the people desire and that is making America the best Country that stands and fights for it's citizens first and for most. Not force people out of jobs and replacing them with with green cards and the shame that there is no pride in losing your job because a green card had to be trained to do it. I was a Democrat all my voting life now I am like many of my union friends ashamed of our leaders union and Obama because we need to get back to the America the beautiful and not the America labor full from other countries.
The country I love is almost gone and it is fueled by breaking laws, spending money,flooding the labor markets,sending jobs to lower wage countries, making new trade deals for the rich, and sending the middle class to poverty.
The end is near God Bless America.
