Yi Hsiao I strongly support OPT extension rule. 

As a computer science master student, before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in other countries. But the most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. In my opinion, OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. If this rule is canceled, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. because they are mainly supported by foreign STEM talents.
