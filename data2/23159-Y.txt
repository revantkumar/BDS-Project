I fully support this proposal. It's beneficial for both F-1 students and employers. For students, we'll have the opportunity to utilize what we have learned in a US college in the industry. For employers, they'll have a wider selection of candidates. It is also notable that for certain industries, such as computer science, a lot of the employees are F-1 students. Aborting the OPT extension will cause tremendous disaster to those companies.
