Admittedly, there are Americans who can not find a job. But there are also foreign students who can not find a job. The majority of US companies already give priorities to US workers. As a result, the unemployment percentage of international students is already higher than that of native Americans. It is unfair to say that more US workers can not find a job. We should compare the percentage instead of the absolute number.
