The international student group not only contribute money to U.S. economy, but also has a significant impact on local job market in a good way. For where I stay, Pittsburgh, we actually have many restaurant whose potential customers are international students from PITT and CMU, which for CMU, just for summer and fall of 2015 there are 2264 new international student given by the statistics from Office of International Education of CMU, and about 75% are graduate students who need to rent an apartment, possibly a car, and everything to make a life outside the campus. All of these are contribution to the local economy and the amount of it is significant from every aspect, not even to mention the tuition. Therefore I support the OPT extension policy not only because I as an international student who chose U.S.A to continue my study for a possible job experience and better education,but also because we actually change where we stay into a better place.
