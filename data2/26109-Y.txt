I highly support this OPT extension for STEM degrees. Without this OPT extension, students won't be able to contribute the US tech market. A lot of the tech companies may face the issue of talent loss. Given the opportunity of working in the US, the students are also creating innovative ideas and providing visions to the companies. More and more jobs are created because of these students' potential of creating great products and services. And this is definitely a good thing for all US citizens.
