Lavanya Pandramish I Strongly support the 24-month opt rule. This is enough time for the students to present their skills after Master's degree even though H-1B is not picked. Students spend a lot on their education by taking loans, selling the properties etc. Atleast they should clear off the debts by working atleast 3 years after Master's and also maintain their family responsibilties. People come to US to get international exposure.
