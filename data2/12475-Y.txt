As a recently graduated STEM student, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for a number of reasons. The company I am working for has over 10% engineers that come from foreign countries that have finished their undergraduate or graduate study here in the U.S. and now they are indispensable assets for the company to continually develop and provide support for our products. 

If this proposal fail to pass, a number of U.S. companies will be affected, since many of their recent STEM major new hires will be forced to leave the country and quit their job which will have a big impact on the company's human resources and further generate negative influence on the company's performance, revenues, product planning etc.

If the proposal can pass in the short future, we will have an additional 24 months to work for our company and has a better chance to acquire the working VISA, this will be really beneficial to both the company and us.
