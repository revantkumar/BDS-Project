I strongly support the expanding of OPT for following reasons:

1. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. The international students holding OPT do not compete with low level salary labors, but seek for advanced positions which not fit for most of the locals.

2.Diversity is very important for the U.S. The U.S is powerful because of contributing of people from everywhere of the world. There is no reason to refuse talented and educated young people to contribute for the country.
