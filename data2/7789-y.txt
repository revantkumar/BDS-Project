Patricia Jones I support the OPT extension for international students. 

NAFSA's latest analysis finds that the 974,926 international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed 30.5 billion dollars and supported more than 373,000 jobs to the U.S. economy during the 2014-2015 academic year.

It might be predictable that without the 2 years of working permit which enables skillful international students to partially earn back their tuition fee, the number of international students in the US will half. Since the university economics in the US rely heavily on the tuition fee of international students who pay double amount of tuition fees than the US students, the lose of international students might be a catastrophe. The change of student structure in a university will shake the budget strategies of a university, especially for those small private universities. Many universities might be forced to lay off faculties as a response the fierce change. A conservative budget strategy might also dwindles the competitiveness of US universities while pushing good students to the competitor universities in the UK and Germany for example. In fact, while Canada, France and Germany offer great amount of funding to international students and try to attract high educated immigrants, I cannot foresee any bright future of the conservative act of cancelling the OPT.
