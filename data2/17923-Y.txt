I strongly support to extending the OPT period for F-1 students with STEM degrees. They are well trained in STEM areas and contributing themselves to the development of US high technology. Every year, the demand of the job recruiting is much larger than the offer of graduate students. Without the existence of foreign STEM students, US high technology company will face highly crucial challenge in research and development because of the talents shortage.

United States of America is a country of immigrants. US world leading position is strongly depending on the leading role in science, technology, engineering and maths. Attracting more talent students coming to US, it will boost the world position of United States.
