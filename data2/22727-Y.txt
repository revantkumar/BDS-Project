In year 2013 and 2014, around 16,000,000 overseas students came to US. Each of them pays atleast 25,000$ fees to achieve degree. We can imagine how much they contribute to US economy. Moreover, if they get a chance to work over here, they can make huge impact in growth of our country. And this rule encourages more students to make their career in US that's why I think we should support this rule.
