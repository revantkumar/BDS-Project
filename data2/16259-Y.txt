Allowing immigrant with student visas to enter the US workforce is a slap in the face to all legal residents who have worked hard, earned degrees, played by the rules, and aren't able to get a job because foreign nationalists have taken jobs away from legal residents. Why should the US taxpayer continue to subsidize immigrants? Nearly all countries that have US students studying abroad don't allow them to take jobs that can be filled by their own residents. Why do liberal feel they can continue to play Santa Claus off the backs of hard-working Americans? We're immersed in debt and it is a travesty if the nation's decision makers think this will help our country. Politicians that support this bill will be voted out of office because everyone knows that this issue is ruse by liberals to buy voters by having government support more and more people with more and more hand outs. Many of us are outraged and will do everything in our power to make the public aware of this critical issue!
