Fully support the 24 months OPT extension. This is the most important difference between studying aboard to US and any other countries. Some countries like UK, do not give such chance to foreign students to practice their skills in real jobs. Though UK have Oxford and Cambridge, the unfavorable after graduation policies make all UK universities unattractive to me. Actually, the long OPT plan of US is the cornerstone of the attraction of US high education.
