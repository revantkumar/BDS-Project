I totally support the new policy. Students with STEM Degree contribute greatly to the American companies, especially and Tech companies. The competitiveness of those companies are very crucial for the American economy. Companies would also hire the best candidate for job position. For the same job with same pay, American companies can select Americans over foreigners if they are of the same qualification. I think the new policy is a win-win case for both STEM foreign worker as well as the American society.
