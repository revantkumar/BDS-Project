I strongly support this proposal. 

F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees are the valuable asset to the united states. Most of them are eligible to awarded the scholarship during their studying period. Without the OPT period, most of the graduates need to go back to their own country without any distribution in US, which is a huge loss (billions) to the US economy. 

Under this proposal, there is more probability to keep these students here. The extended training period give them more opportunities to obtain the enough knowledge and skills to serve US society better.
