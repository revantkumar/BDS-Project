Qiang Zhang Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002

I strongly support opt extension rule. As I could recall from Mike Bloomberg who said on Stanford commencement:

"Just think about what that means: We invite foreign students to study here, we subsidize the universities they attend with research funding and other aid, and then after those students have mastered the material, we tell them to go somewhere else and work for one of our competitors.
Its the most backwards economic policy you could possibly come up with.
I call it national suicide because we are destroying our future by turning our back on our history and weve got to stop it."

US economy, especially in tech-related areas, is highly relied on talents worldwide. It will damage US interest to send "well trained" international student to other countries and let them work for competitor of US.
