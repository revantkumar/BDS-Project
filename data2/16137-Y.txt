Currently, the global economy is recovering slower than people think. Technology and science as the most important factors to boost economy are the keys for the United States to go through the economy regression. As President Obama mentioned, the U.S higher-education trained and educated world-class students who were potential labors in the future, and because of the immigration policy, they could not stay in the U.S. This is the tremendous lose to the U.S because the nation lost excellent people from all the world to build the powerful country.
Many countries such as China and Japan are suffering population aging and lack of labor force, but the U.S. can attract well-trained labor all over the world. It does not make sense for the U.S to let the excellent engineers and scientist leave the country. 

Why the U.S can be the super power for a century? Excellent people in STEM is the answer.

Please think about what the U.S will lose if let these students leave after graduation.
