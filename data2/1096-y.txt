Ketan Walia I fully support the proposed new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of current 17 months. In my opinion this increased duration of practical training is vital for the students to fully utilise the education they have received. Moreover, STEM which typically stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) advanced degrees are areas of utmost importance to the technological & scientific progress of USA as a nation. And it would be in the best of the interest of the nation to optimise the capabilities of people having advanced degrees in these areas. STEM advanced degrees are very specialised in nature and it takes years of education for a student to gain expertise in these specialised fields. The skill sets required to gain STEM designated education are also very niche. For example, to be able to do Masters in Computer Science the student needs to have, the 4 years duration, engineering undergraduate degree and in his high school as well he/she should have had science & mathematics subjects. Thus, a student typically going for a STEM designated advanced degree has already put in years of education in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics making them competent enough to be further able to gain expertise in these field by going for STEM designated advanced degrees. As such, these students are intellectual assets for the nation which the nation should capitalise for their own advancement and extension of OPT practically means this only.All together, this extension is imperative to maintain this nation's economic , scientific and technological competitiveness.
