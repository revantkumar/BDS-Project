Cory Nerderman As an American patriot, I highly support this rule! I believe there will be more talent people contributing to this country in the prime of their life. The U.S. will also be more competitive in international student market.

I feel so disappointed after reading others negative comments from compatriots. 
Most of those are about that the new extension rule will take jobs away from Americans, or even saying the STEM students is harming American's economy.

Please ask yourself: 
1. Who is more advanced when looking for job, American citizen or foreign students?
2. Could we lost our job if we are more talent than foreign people? 
3. How does foreign students hurt economy after spend around 100 thousand dollars tuition and living expense?
