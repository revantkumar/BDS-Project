The STEM extension is very necessary and this policy will totally benefit the USA not only the economic but also the international influence in the long run. We all know that one of the most important reasons that make US so strengthful and successful today is that the contributions of the millions of the excellent immigrants made years and centuries ago. Most of the Americans today are originally from other countries, their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents were immigrants from Germany, Russia, Italy and they came to US and spend their whole lives to make USA as great as today! Now their posterity forget all these and say they don't want any immigrants anymore which is not only selfish but also short-sighted! The excellent and hard working immigrants may take few positions from Americans now but in the long run, but by making their efforts to their companies they will benefit the economy of the US for sure! Because the more competition, the harder the man will work, this is a ground truth! If the law doesn't allow the international students to have a chance to work here, and give all the positions to Americans, the US companies may not be able to make much progress as the lack of competition and will have a bad influence to the overall US economy in the long term. Also, this policy only gives more chance to the international students to find a job, if the students are not as good as or better than the Americans, they still unable to find jobs. So if the Americans are really confident at themselves, they don't need to worry about anything. With the efforts that make by the new immigrants, the US economy will keep increasing and thus makes more positions available to Americans!
