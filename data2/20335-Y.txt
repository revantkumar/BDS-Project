Strongly support this proposal!
It's no doubt that this is good for US education and industry.

For Education:
US universities gets financial benefits from foreign students and are able to build benefit the local students by building better environment. Besides, they rank higher because of foreign students. 

If there is no OPT Extension, there will be less international students for sure. Cause OPT extension is a major reason for foreign students to choose US for further study. With OPT extension, students could get good training in the foreign study. If there is no OPT extension, there is no big difference between US and Europe, WHY NOT choose Europe universities?

For Industry:
US engineering industry has been grown fast because of F1-students. 
Without opt extension, there will be a lack of employees. The local people in stem major is not sufficient for
the market. 

The proposal does not affect the local people's employment at all. The company always want the US citizens first and if it's not enough, they go for F1 students.
