Who is against the OPT extension? What is your purpose? Do you think salary will be increased by voting down OPT extension? I do not think so. Because of globalization, US companies are competing with companies all over the world. If we do not use these high skilled workers, others will! Look at Samsung! Mitsubishi! Look at how many students from US they hired! The one who voting down this extension is the one who needs to work harder. 

I do not think any managers from big companies will oppose the OPT extension. Most of them has/had hired OPT students before. Please do ask around and then make a decision. And whatever decision you make, remember, it will not increase your salary or reduce competitions.
