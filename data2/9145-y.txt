HSY Liu I SUPPORT increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. 

I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. Learning isn't just within school. Practical training is essential to the success of future career and 24 months are barely enough time to acquire a single knowledge or skill that is crucial to the students. We need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S. It definitely helps U.S. grow and innovate as well. Don't kill a talent for its immigration status.
