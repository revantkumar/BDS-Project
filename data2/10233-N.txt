There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree.
There are about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties, many of whom would
return to those fields with appropriate incentives. The OPT foreign workers will displace graduating Americans who are
struggling to repay massive student loans.

By turning the F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas, DHS is doing an end
run around Congressional limits on H-1b 3-year work visas.
There are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas,
yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields.

Big Tech lobbyists have spent over $1 billion seeking immigration increases, but Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are laying
off tens of thousands of employees.

We CANNOT TOLERATE IMMIGRANT STUDENTS with extended Visas in the United
States, just for the "saved money" of it especially. We U.S. citizens have plenty qualified specialists and new college grads to do
our country's work, so please do not support any new rules or laws that would allow more immigrants in/extend their visas to take
these jobs away from our own.
