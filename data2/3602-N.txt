This OPT Program must not be expanded. It should be ended completely. It is taking American jobs and giving them to foreign nationals at the expense of American workers. Further, it is robbing the Social Security System and Medicare System of needed income tax revenues. What idiot thought this was a good idea to begin with? It must end!
