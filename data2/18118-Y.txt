I strongly support the new rule not because of my immigration status as an international student but because of the basic common knowledge of STEM job market. 
I see that most objections are based on the understanding that foreigners might take away the opportunities for U.S. citizens, which is insanely wrong. Do some research to find out the percentage of foreigners working in STEM related companies using OPT. As far as I know, the number is even no more than 10% according to the statistics on BLS. If you ask me, there are even NOT enough opportunities for international students. Also foreigners are not as competitive as natives in job market because other than the skills, knowledges and experiences, the culture difference on probably the entire life till now is a HUGE disadvantage for us international students. So if you can not compete with one who has more skills and knowledge than you, but with different cultural background, who to blame? 
I guess a lot of us have forgotten the reason why we have OPT is that the shortage of STEM related workforce can not be remedied by natives. Thus we go seek for help from foreigners. The problem is rooted from children lacking interest in STEM, thus not choosing this career path, and of course this problem could only be solved temporarily by using foreign workforce. If we do not attract more children into STEM related fields, the problem would be worse and worse. Thus don't worry about foreigners "steal" jobs from you, worrying about the next generation is far more important than this. And before the time this problem is solved, more foreign workforce is need in STEM fields, even.
