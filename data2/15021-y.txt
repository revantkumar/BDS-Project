George Reagan We need to put more emphasis on current American citizens being protected from illegal immigrants coming here and 
spreading diseases, unemployment, dependency on government aid and potential terrorism. The wall in Arizona has been 
effective and the increase in state reservist helping Border Agents in Texas is a positive way to protect our borders. Only 
two Southern border states, Calif-or-nia and New Mexico, demowit controlled states, are not being effective in controlling 
illegal immigration. Supporting current youths in completing a primary and secondary education should be our goal. Getting 
these kids out of poverty and improving their chances of being a successful adult is the only answer to Americas success as 
being the World's leader and most Exceptional nation. We don't need a socialist, over bearing federal bureaucracy to take us
down the road to serfdom and a utopian society.
