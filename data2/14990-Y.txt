As a F1 student study and work in America, I really need this STEM approved. Because the first year working here I just learnt how everything works, finally I'm when I'm good at all the necessary program, I learnt all the skills in my first year, I can use what I learnt to make contribution in the following years. It's a pity for the American company if STEM are not going to approved. Because I think every STEM students are the same situation like me: The company invest a lot of money on us, training us, let us learn and allow us make mistakes, finally when we are ready to make contribution to the company, we have to leave. So for our career and the American company's own interests, approve the STEM extension!
