I am 100% supporting this rule for the following 3 reasons:
1. By extending the OPT period, more students will come to US for college education and therefore greatly help the US education system.
2. For certain areas of STEM ( CS/ Quant), it is much better for US to have talents from all over the world.
3. US is famous for its openness and freedom since it founded, by allowing foreign students staying in US and work, it really helps US build its reputation internationally.
