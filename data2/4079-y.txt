John Yan I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. This will be a win-win decision for US and international students! As a PhD student in Computer Science, I have been in US for more than 5 years. Before I came to US, I was a software engineer with CS master degree in China. The most important reason I choose to pursue PhD here is that US has great research opportunities and practical training in academia as well as industry. The F-1 OPT extension is very important to international STEM students, because we can obtain more practical training after spending many years in school. In the past few years, I see more and more Chinese graduate students coming to my university (and other universities I believe). We study here. We eat here. We live here. We pay many taxes here. Most importantly, we would like to get more training here before going back China. Without the OPT extension, the graduate education in US would loss its attraction. It's hard to imagine how the high-tech companies, e.g. Google, FB, Apple, would keep competitive renovations with the loss of many international creative minds. Moreover, I believe that many universities would loss a huge portion of financial income if fewer international students would come to US for master degrees.
Anyway, hope more people support this good rule!
