The deprivation of the STEM extension program would be a huge loss for America's economy.

Many international students choose America to pursue their higher degrees mainly because of the high quality education and a chance of working in America. With little or no scholarship available to the international students, most students pay their tuitions in full and this is a huge income of a lot of the collages and universities. Also renting, food services, entertainment industries and tourism all benefit from this group of foreign population.

Without this program, US will lose the advantage of attracting international students to their places for higher degrees.
