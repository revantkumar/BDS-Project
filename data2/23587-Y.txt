I agree time training period for F1 students extend to 24 months. I am doing a PHD and have this feeling that in my first two years study, I learn a lot in historical development of the field, however finding there's a gap between those knowledge I gained in past years and practically use it in my real work. Even if different, while I find master students are facing similar situation. Opt extension will benefi them this way and therefore make universities competitive globally.
