The high percentage of international students in STEM subjects in US universities is not because the American students don't have opportunities to apply for these STEM majors, but rather because they choose other majors, as a result of increasing market demand from US booming high tech companies, the schools see the necessity for increasing STEM students enrollment and, therefore, filling the gap by accepting more international students. Therefore, the argument that international STEM students squeezing out American students' job opportunity is invalid. Discouraging international STEM students to find jobs in US will only hurt US economy by forcing the High Tech companies to move their offices to overseas as they won't be able to find enough to STEM graduates in US.
