I strongly support this proposed rule. 
US high tech companies could benefit from well educated international employees to create more profits. 
In addition, continuous efforts of international students could boost US technological and economic development in a long time, thus even more work opportunities can be created and benefit both internationals and citizens. Third, international students in STEM majors contributes their talents in tech fields to make US companies more competitive than companies in other countries, the loss of these talents would strengthen those competitors.
