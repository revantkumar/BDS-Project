Agree with this rule. If those OPT students cannot work for US companies, those India outsourcing companies would get more people into US high-tech companies. They are cheaper, they have H1B or H4. At that time, you American citizens would witness more unemployment in your country. You want to see that happen? Then continue to go against this rule.
