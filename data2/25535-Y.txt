My job hunting experience tell me many many US companies are not willing to hire international students due to the additional paperwork, attorney fees, visa petition fees, and the uncertainty of the students' availability to work in this country. However, sometimes the employers have to go through the complicated process to hire F-1 graduate, because they really could not find an eligible US candidate for that specific position.

US employers prefer to hire US citizens rather than international students. I tried to find a job last year after I graduate with a graduate degree in Engineering. In many cases, once I selected "Yes" for the question "Do you need sponsorship to work in the US", the online application system will automatically reject my application. My resume didn't even get a chance to be viewed by a human. On the other hand, my classmates who has US citizenship found a good job even before graduation.

US economy is recovering, and needs more STEM workers. Without enough talented STEM workers, many companies have to move to other countries, which could case a huge loss for the US in the long run. Improving and expanding the OPT will greatly benefit US economy and US people.
