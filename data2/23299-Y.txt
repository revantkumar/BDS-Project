I have a dream to innovate in science. As a child I used to think a lot about how things happen and how they can be improved. I have a constructive personality. I believe in creating and innovating. As an individual I have observed that everyone in this planet need an opportunity to grow and help the society. People sometimes don't get chance to help the society because of lack of opportunity.
Extending the STEM for students means creating a positive energy. This energy will help students learn more and concentrate in research. In this new world where we are facing many challenges related to pollution, health hazards we need help from the young minds and utilize there energy in research.

Extending STEM for student is good for the society and economy. I have reasons as follows:-
1.) Students gets time to think and create new job opportunity for the society.
2.) They get a chance to research rather than struggling and worrying about time barrier.
3.) They have hopes that government is with them and supports their approach for getting a good degree with some experience. 
4.) Students get a good returns out of their investment in studies.

I am supporting the STEM extension.
