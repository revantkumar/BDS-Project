I support the OPT extension. Companies should hire the most qualified people. A lot of international students are top talents from their home countries. America will benefit from this new rule if those people are able to work here for a longer time. 

Those who oppose the new rule might be the lazy and less talented people. There is no benefit to hire them just because they are Americans.
