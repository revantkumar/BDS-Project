Zexi Liu I can't emphasize enough how important it is to pass this OPT extension rule. A surplus of international students coming into US has already boasted local U.S. economy (Take a look at luxury cars and apartments those international students bought while studying in US. It is really insane). Passing up this OPT rule would even attract more foreigners to come to US to study. While it is true passing OPT might take away some jobs, but remember the government DOES have a ~80,000 H1B work visa limit!! So, what are you guys afraid of? Most of these internationals will work for two more years and go back to their home countries. This barely mess up with Americans finding job at all. 

Also, I do believe one of the key reasons why American enterprises are doing so well globally is that they actively seeking talents around the world. Such competitions will also benefit American STEM students to force them to study harder. Sure once again, foreigners take American jobs but successful operations of U.S. companies would expand their business to hire even more Americans like sales person, manufacturing workers in the long run. 

The most importantly, OPT rule should be passed because there is simply a shortage of STEM workers in U.S. STEM jobs on average are going to increase by 14% each year(see www.ed.gov/stem). That is a lot of shortage. So tech companies are in need to hire more talents. And internationals with STEM degrees will alleviate the problem, and help America to rebuild its economy. Note I am only talking about STEM field. Its job market is far different from other industries where there might be a high unemployment rate. Internationals cannot use this OPT extension to do other non-STEM jobs.

So I think this rule is a remarkably great one that should be passed. It sure helps the foreigners but more importantly helps U.S. economy to revitalize.
