It's not ture that a lot of people who oppose this rule said US goverment think more on international student over local students, and said US goverment is sacrificing future of local students.

However, almost all STEM international students works for high technology company, their skills, motivation and diligence are much higher than common college students. I need to say students from India and China, their intellegence are selected from huge population, they are smart and can work under high pressure and keep continuous hard work. 

Think about it, students from China when they graduate here, only a small part students can be kept here, all others will go back to their own country. Thoes students are the best group of students, how you can compare thoes students to the common American students. 

I need to say, students who can use OPT work here don't have competition with local students. Because if the local students qualify those jobs, are US employers stupid taking much more risk and inconvenience to hire international students?

My American friends who study hard or smart can find jobs very easily, much easier than international students who has the same quality. 

The local students who are still complain they are unemployed should calm down and think more about yourself. I think there are two ways thoes unemployed American students can do:
1. Study more and improve yourself, especially learn more math and physics knowledge, do not aways be arrogant and self- absorbed. 
2.Ask your president Obama to get the manufacture jobs back to US from China, thoes manufucture factories need a lot more technicians or workers which can slove the unemployement of the local college students.
