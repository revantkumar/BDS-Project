Stephanie Jackson International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 50% - from US$4.4 trillion in 2012 to US$6.2 trillion. International students have become integral to the financial health of many US higher education institutions, but the impact goes beyond money spent on tuition fees and living expenses. If this rule is not passed, foreign STEM grads will take their skills and education to their home countries, costing America the opportunity for job-creating innovation. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.
