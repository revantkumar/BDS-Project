I strongly oppose expanding the Optional Practical Training (OPT) Program for the following reasons:

There are more than 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) degree.

There are about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties, many of whom would return to those fields with appropriate incentives.

The OPT foreign workers will displace graduating Americans who are struggling to repay massive student loans.

By turning the F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas, DHS is circumventing Congressional limits on H-1b 3-year work visas.

There are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas, yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields.

Big Tech lobbyists have spent over $1 billion seeking immigration increases, but Southern California Edison, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard are laying off tens of thousands of employees. This is a terrible abuse of the H-1b system and may have resulted in illegal activity. I believe ICE has failed to fully investigate and prosecute these abuses.

My son is an engineering major in college and as a U.S. citizen, he should not have to compete with foreign nationals for U.S. jobs when he graduates from college.
