The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.
Initially, the Department of Homeland Security expanded the OPT program by bypassing the transparent notice-and-comment period. But the D.C. District Court ordered DHS to temporarily vacate the expansion. The judge has given DHS until February 2016 to complete the notice-and-comment period. Therefore, if enough comments opposing the rule are submitted, DHS could pull the proposed regulation entirely.
