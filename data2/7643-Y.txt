I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension rule.

Foreign students make tremendous contribution to the US economy. Most of the best STEM workers are foreigners. They are helping lots and lots of high tech companies bring more revenue. Those who say that foreign students are taking away citizens' jobs are absolutely wrong. Citizens have huge advantages in job market over foreign students, mainly because citizens do not need sponsor from companies, and they have language advantage. Then why companies are still willing to hire foreign students? That's because they are more qualified than other competitors. You cannot blame your competitors being strong for your own weakness. Foreign students do bring in competition to the job market, but that's a good thing! Competition brings out the best in people and that's exactly what makes US the leading country in the world. Driving foreign students out of the country would be a disaster for US. Those students came here, received the best education, learned the best skills, and now you want to push them to your competitor countries to make contribution there? I do not see what that will do good to our country.

Finally, I just wanna say, every citizen and their ancestors were immigrants. Immigrants made the history of this country. We attract talents from all over the world and we make miracles together over and over again. That's what makes the country strong.
