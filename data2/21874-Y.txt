I got my master degree in US and am currently working for an International manufacture company on OPT extension ending in September 2016. I plan to go home after the ending. My goal is to go back home with the developed skills and foreign experience for the same company. This is a company that I can have my whole career if I want to. 

My current boss is happy to have me because we do a lot business with my home country and I'm a perfect fit for this role understanding both sides' culture. It will be a shame if I have to go back home next Feb because the sudden change of the OPT extension policy and it interrupted my plan. I hope US government can at least stick to what they promised me when they filed me the EAD card. 

Hence, I sincerely hope passing this proposal and show my strong support for this proposal. Thank you!
