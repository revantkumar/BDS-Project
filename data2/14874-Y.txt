I fully support the rule. First, stem students are not only a group of people contributing US economy but also who will be very likely to create jobs to American people especially in science& tech industry. My STEM friends in USA already created several start-ups in IT and environmental industry that are hiring Americans. Americans still have big advantages in completing in jobs due to the uncertainty, troublesome process and cost of H1B applications. The STEM students staying are those who are truly contributing the economy and technology innovations in Tech fields, and those are people USA want to keep. Imagine a MIT PhD has to be sent home if he miss the first H1B lottery and doesn't have chance for the second, I would say thank you US universities for your effort to train talented people for other countries. So If you want to fight for jobs, focus on those thousands of illegal immigrants. 

For Universities, it will be a disaster if the rule failed. Removing STEM OPT extension will tremendously discourage qualified students coming to USA. Firstly, those foreign STEM students usually pay high tuition in full amount especially in Master programs, and that money is a big portion of Universities' income to support their research. Secondly, one of the reasons that US universities rank top in the world is that it's attracting top students all over the globe, and those students are boosting the academy in their advance degrees. However, if the government is sending out wrong signals that we don't invite STEM students to come anymore, the position of the academy in USA will be compromised.

A good immigration rule is to keep those will benefit and keep away those are purely taking advantage. Think deeper when emotions veil your judgment. OPT Extension is a beneficial rule to USA.
