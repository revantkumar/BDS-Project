We must retain job opportunities for our teenage and college age Americans. These young people people need the opportunity to earn money to pay for college and to start their lives here in the U.S. Our young adults should have first chance for employment in the seasonal job and career search. We must be an example of how to earn a living and how to use the monies earned for a productive life. 
Do not deny our young people a chance to grow and prosper here in America.
