Pranav H I strongly believe that the experience acquired during the bachelors/Masters program in US will benefit to the technology growth and increase skilled labor force thereby contributing to the US economy. However, It should be easier for Employers to sponsor the students as many students have tough time finding companies that sponsor. i believe OPT period is valuable time for a student to enter the corporate world and gain the expertise that is needed.it will be beneficial to newly graduated STEM students.Please EXTEND OPT period
