I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 
1. It is really reasonable for the foreign students to hope to contribute to the place, where they have studied and lived for years. If they have the chances to get job interviews and offers, they can also have the chance to get the extension of the OPT. 
2. Diversity is important. A lot of celebrities and scholars were once international students when they just arrived in US. OPT extension is good for US to attract more successful students, who are the potential ones of significance. 
3. Of course, more international students mean more competition. Thus, the chance of getting more competitive candidates for the jobs is higher, too. Also, competitions can make all the candidates behave better and enhance themselves at the same time.
