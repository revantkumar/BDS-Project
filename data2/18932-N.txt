This is a bad and unnecessary program; it should be provided, on the same terms, to the hundred thousands of American kids who would like to do the work but cannot afford the current school costs, and cannot get preference on government sponsored intern progams. 

There is no justification whatsoever for this program; it is not the responsibility of the American tax payer to educate foreign students; plenty of Americans who could use a education in an occupational field.
