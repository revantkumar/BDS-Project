I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason: 
1. Competition is a good thing. With competition, people strive to do more than is required. In addition, competition motivates people keep on learning new knowledge/skills, which makes them be more succeed.

2. International students have made a lot of contributions to the U.S. They increase the diversity of the U.S. and bring more oversea cooperation between U.S. and other countries.
