First, I support the proposal.
As F1 students, we are not competing with american students. All american students in my school are much much much easier to find jobs. So I don't think american students don't take stem degree because of the competition from international students. If they want, they can choose CS, EE, anything they want. Employers still prefer to hire an american student because if they do so they won't take risk to lose a well trained employee.
I think still many employers choose to hire international students because they need skilled employees, but this requirement cannot be fulfilled by just american workers. So I think extension of OPT sis a good proposal because it will make it easier to meet the need of the industry. And it is good to the economy of the country and people live here. 

Another thing I want to mention that, there are many startup companies in the city I'm living. Most employees of these companies are from countries like India and China. Maybe they get very low payment, but they very work hard to make those company run well. They are doing important work to bring new blood to the industry. And I think it's a good thing.
