I, as an international student that is going to graduate this December, strongly SUPPORT the STEM extension proposal.

The reduction of work opportunities in those traditional manufacturing businesses has no direct relationship with OPT & STEM. In the contrast, we STEM students commit ourselves into those STEM related companies, flourish the employment environment, accelerate the growth of those businesses, and thus imply thousands of opportunities. We are not working for those companies who eliminate positions inside the US and move outside the US for cheaper human resources.

We are not here to create social problems. Were willing to fairly compete. We stay here, we make contributions, and we make the whole working environment even better.
