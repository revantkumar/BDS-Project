I believe this proposal will create a win-win effect for both US citizens and international students, thus I strongly support it. 
As a Property Accountant in Boston, MA, my company (a Jewish Real Estate company focusing on residential leasing) has a lot of international student lessees in Cambridge area (mainly for Harvard Univ & MIT). They generate a large amount of stable revenue for my company every year, and the company never worries about unit vacancy. Therefore, my company benefits a lot from international students. As the company keeps expanding recently, we are glad to give more back to surrounding neighborhood, through more charity donation and more tax payment.
The proposal will definitely attract more STEM international student to Great Boston area, generate more need for student housing, and my company can expand larger and create a lot more jobs for local citizens (I don't think any STEM student will apply for Property Management/Leasing jobs). Therefore I definitely support this proposal and hopefully it will pass eventually.
