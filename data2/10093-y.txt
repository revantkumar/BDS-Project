Yahan Zhou I strongly support this rule and I do believe that it is beneficial for the USA in the following aspects:
1)It improves both education and research quality of US universities by attracting the best students from all over the world. By offering and extending OPT, the USA is currently more attractive for international students than the countries that do not provide similar programs (e.g. United Kingdom).
2)Failing to do so will force many high-tech companies to move their branches to foreign countries like Canada, China and Europe countries. I have a friend who is recently reallocated to the London office of his company because his OPT expired. This has very serious consequences. Firstly, if the companies move their people and offices to foreign countries, their tax will go to other countries. The companies will have less employees in the USA, thus the demand of houses, restaurants and other local services will drop, which hurts the local economic and reduces the number of jobs. What's more, it makes the USA less competitive in high-tech fields as the best educated people are leaving USA.
