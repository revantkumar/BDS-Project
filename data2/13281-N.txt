Dear Sir,
There are already hundreds of thousands of STEM workers in the USA especially older ones who cannot find steady employment, a lot of this is due to age discrimination. This new law you are proposing is only going to make it harder for them to find jobs. Tech companies are already having sky high profits, their stock prices are at all time highs, if they want to attract more workers they can simply raise wages or hire more laid off American workers. They can easily afford this! As an American voter I am vehemently opposed to this legislation that does nothing to help AMERICAN workers.

Thank you
