Keith Graham International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. STEM-related disciplines are responsible for many of the societal innovations that make our world better. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions. This rule is very beneficial for retaining talented international students.
