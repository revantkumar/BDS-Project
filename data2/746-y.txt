Hiram M Maxwell I am against the OPT and H-1B Visas. Both are nothing but a corporate welfare to allow for cheap labor. This was shown by the actions of Disney. These programs are devastating to the American families and the country at large. Along with being detrimental to our economy, I believe there is a significant risk to our national security. We need to put Americans to work, not replace them with foreign workers just to add more profit to greedy corporate robbers. These are the actions of a tyrannical government, not those of a democratic republic. It shows how members of congress enter as almost penniless individuals and leave as millionaires. It appears the greed for money and power has overtaken any semblance of moral fortitude and character.
