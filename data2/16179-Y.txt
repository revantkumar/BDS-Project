The STEM major graduates essentially serve as the backbone of our economy, and the idea of evicting them immediately after their graduation because they would take away "American" jobs does really not stand to the test of reality.

Had we prevented the international students from applying their know-hows and knowledge to work and create in this country: there would be no Google for web search (and everything), eBay would not be in place, we would not have Instagram (to share our lovely photos over the world), no PayPal, Tesla - and many, many more revolutionary business and technology that changes our way of living (for significantly better) and making so much contributions to American economy in a variety of ways.
