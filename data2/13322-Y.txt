To whom it may concern,

I came to US because of its diversity, its embrace of intelligence, and its cutting-edge policies. However, I was really disappointed by the proposal that cancels the expanding training opportunities for F-1 visa with STEM Degrees. What is the education for? For bringing great ideas to the real world, for improving our lives with our knowledge, for collaborating with people from all over the world. 

As a F-1 student with STEM degree, I do want to contribute myself after graduation, I do want to seize the opportunities, I do want to have a bright future. But, I need a supportive environment. Without it, I will be like a bird without wings, a fish without water. How sad it is! I believe US welcomes all brilliant students because we could create lots of value to this country as well as maximize the benefits from the jobs. It will reach to a win-win situation for STEM extension. I hope you could consider it sincerely.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Regards,
A F-1 Student with a hopeful heart
