When are those who are elected to represent Americans and our children going to put OUR INTERESTS first? We have millions of fellow citizens out of work. We have record numbers of young Americans not able to find a decent job. Our middle class and poor are be decimated by FOREIGNERS taking our jobs. 

STAND UP FOR AMERICAN'S NOW! JOBS FOR EVERY AMERICAN BEFORE ANOTHER FOREIGNER IS BROUGHT INTO OUR COUNTRY!
