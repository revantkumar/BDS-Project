Hua Zhu I really appreciate this rule. I am a engnieering majored international student. This rule can attract more students coming to US to study. This rule also gives more opportunities to those students to contribute their gains from school back to US. Thus students can get experience from work and companies can get what they need as well. This new rule will create a win win environment.
