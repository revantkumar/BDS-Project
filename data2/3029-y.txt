Qing Gao I supposed the opt extension is not only a policy that will be good to the international stem students ,
It is also important to the development of the USA . We know that too much positions need students who
major in stem. Also, if just working for one year, I don't think it will be good to both employees and 
employers, since it will stop the work and waste a lot of emplyoers' time and money.The consequence is there will be less employers would like hiring international stem student, which is a huge loss to our science area.
