Highly support the proposal. Local company does not hire international employee, since they even do not know how to help them to apply working visa. But for those transnational company, international employee are very important. They bring the company new culture and inspiration, makes the company diversity and competitive. They are not threat of citizen. They are even not in the same pool.

American is a diversified and inclusive country, but not the only one.
I BELIEVE US cannot develop so fast without the international people contribution
