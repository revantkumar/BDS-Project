USA is land immigrant , Each wave immigrant has contributed to the progress of the nation . As per the us policy restrict the highly qualified graduates .
Extension of F1 training nothing to do H1B visa program. If this restricted more people will come with the limit of H1B. 
Positive and negative program is separate issue and may be discussed on H1B program.

People have traveled to USA to study with plan get trained for 29 month as per the prevailing rule . changing the rule middle of the program is not correct and ethical . this is primary reason court has given six month to regularize .

In order maintain the commitment made USA through rules has I would suggest keep extension as per the original rule.

H1B program is separate, I would suggest H1B may be restricted to Post graduate and Doctorate from US universities with out limit for the selected field . This improve technology development and many of the top tech companies got maximum benefits from the high tech students .
