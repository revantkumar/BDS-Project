Adam Zhang America is in short of the STEM talents now, we can see that in the high tech companies, these newly graduated students are doing a huge contribution now. If the stem extension is expanded, it will definitely good for the development of the american economy, as well as in the high tech industry. So here, I highly recommend that the american needs these talents, and we need to expand the time for them to apply there skills to help the America to going upward. 
So we need this proposal to be passed.
