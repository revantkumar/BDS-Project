The first duty of the elected officials and the employees of this government is to protect the interests of the people of this country. This includes that our citizens are given the first opportunity at all jobs. The mere idea of bringing in people from out of this country that or have been filled with Americans is obscene. The only ones who profit from this are the big businesses that use this to lower their expenses. If they can't find the talent here then they should look to sponsor educational programs to train our people. This act is a gift to the corporations and helps aggravate the economic woes we are already suffering.
