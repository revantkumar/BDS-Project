Kasturi Dani I strongly support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months.

As an international student, I am currently pursuing a STEM degree at the University of Washington in Seattle. I support the proposal for reinstating the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.

Without the possibility of STEM OPT extension, unless an employer is able to secure an H1B visa within a year of graduating, it's extremely difficult for international STEM graduates to gain practical experience, which is crucial following the completion of their degree. With the increased number of H1B applications every year, it makes the possibility of gaining practical experience even more difficult.

STEM graduates also benefit U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. They also aid U.S. companies by allowing employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.

Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rule-making. Studying in the U.S. is also a huge investment for international STEM students and they hope to supplement their education by gaining practical experience following the completion of their degree.

In conclusion, I strongly support the STEM OPT extension proposal and I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016.

Thank you
