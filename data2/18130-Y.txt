I personally don't need OPT, but I would support this OPT extension with all of my efforts. There are many friends around me who are super intelligent, and productive, and contributed to the team work very much. But due to the short period OPT, they have to face a dilemma when choosing their career, even been kicked out the states. This STEM OPT extension will definitely help international genius better suite their positions with their skills, therefore contribute the best to US economics. It won't hurt us if we keep more genius foreign workers, but it will be a huge loss at our side if we lose them.
