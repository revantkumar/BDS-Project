My name is Roberta Guild. I have two sons, who are very gifted in the Math and Sciences. They were both in the top 1% of their high school classes, and attended Cornell (pre-vet), Clarkson, and Syracuse University.

I do not think Homeland Security should extend the number of years that foreign students could work for US Tech Companies from 1 to 3 years.

They are squeezing out the United States talent.

Unemployment, or employment at jobs beneath that of the qualifications of workers, is far too high. Such a policy would hurt Americans who have been trained to fill high tech jobs.

My one son works for Apple, and is utilizing his education. My other son owns a restaurant despite his genius IQ and many accomplishments in the math and science fields, including a degree from Cornell. That should not be the case.

Sincerely,
Roberta Guild
