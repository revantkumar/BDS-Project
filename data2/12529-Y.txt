To the concerned authorities:
I hope you will go through my entire comment,

My Stand on the proposed regulation: Positive

The recently proposed regulation in a positive step forward in attracting international students more towards USA than any other countries. 24- month extension of the employment opportunity definitely helps the international students who have invested their time and their(or parents)lifetime money savings for getting quality education. Most of the international students preferred higher studies in USA because of the opportunities available here to apply their knowledge gained through their education. 

Backing out on this proposed extension will have serious negative impact on the 
1) Current International Students future who were all ready there here in the USA as they do not have enough time to plan their alternative for their future
2) Prospective students who prefer other countries for their higher education where the chance of gaining a practical knowledge is more rather than just studying at the university
3) Global Competitiveness of the USA universities (Will fail to attract the best of the talent for their research and making breath taking innovations) 
4) Huge revenue loss to the USA universities
5) Employers suffer lack of quality resources who have advanced degrees
6) Global competitiveness of the US tech companies as no organization can achieve the success with out having the best of the talent
7) Knowledge drain in the tech fields in the future(may not have immediate impact)
8) Non-diverse environment

Analyzing each of the points mentioned above will give the overall picture of the affected parties if the proposed rule does not go through and to avoid these circumstances it is absolutely necessary to pass the proposed regulation by DHS.

Concerns raised by the USA citizens(mentioned in previous comments) :
