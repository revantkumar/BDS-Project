As far as i am concerned, i am strongly for the expansion of the OPT, as an international student, i will try my best to finish my master's degree and then find an internship or a full-time job in USA. But sometimes we are not ready for the new start, not only the employers but also the students are not satisfied with each other, we all want to find the well paid job, the employers try to absorb some skillful employees. So we should schedule the plan and find the proper jobs based on ability. 

Based on the above reasons, the government should extend the expiration. I am looking forward to seeing this change.

Sincerely
