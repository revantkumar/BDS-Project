I think this OPT policy is good for US economy, especially under the good market condition these years. Most IT companies prefer to keep their core technologies inside the homeland rather than setting up a remote, international tech-center. With this new OPT proposal, the companies are easier to hire much more skilled, well-educated students inside the homeland and develop more job opportunities to the country. Giving an working position to a student means keeping a future, those young people would make a bigger success to the company then contribute to the society with their passion and energy.
