The American worker is being slowly put out of work. American STEM college graduates will find an enlarged pool of low wage non-American workers to compete against. I am totally against this end-around, which is a handout to the tech industry, while undermining US workers many who have spent blood, sweat and tuition to apply for STEM jobs. There is no shortage of American STEM workers! Protect our American workers by revoking this new rule!
