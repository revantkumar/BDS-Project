I'm presently on the STEM extension, and while I make my career moves (changing jobs, choosing employers) I have to constantly keep in mind my case as a special case. I've found quite a few employers not willing to carry on final talks of employment, when they realise that there is a possibility that I might not be allowed to work in the US after a certain date. In my case, the timing is unfortunate since the end of the 17 months, lands me far away from the April 1 H1-B filing deadline, which employers worry about not getting a chance to sponsor me for. The proposed extra 7 months would help me greatly by allowing me to continue working in the US until the next April, at which time, only luck can decide the outcome as it turns out. I know for a fact that employers would also look at this more favourably, since they'd at least have the opportunity to file my H1-B, and would give them time to make alternate arrangements, make use of my skillset, and I know I'd have had an opportunity to use my newly acquired skills to help out a couple of companies do good work that benefits the US economy, and people at large. We're highly qualified individuals, and are not seeking handouts/pity - only a level playing field to showcase our skills, and in turn gain valuable experience while benefitting the US economy. Canceling the STEM extension on the OPT is not creating a level playing field, and isn't the US after all the land of opportunities. If it can't provide a level platform where opportunities are available for the people who are eager and able, it is losing a vast amount of untapped potential, that will eventually lose the US its competitive technical edge in the world. Let us do what we're good at, and give us some time to do it - the proposed STEM extension of 24 months is a right step in that direction.
