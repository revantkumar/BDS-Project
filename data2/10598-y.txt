Ian Ince If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions. This suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
