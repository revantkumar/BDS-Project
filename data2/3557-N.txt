I don't understand what's going on with our government. We don't take care of our veterans and this would keep us from educating our children. I believe in helping your neighbor but not at our children's expense.Please do not pass this rule. Many of our families cannot afford college. Our kids need trade schools and skill sets.We must look after our own first.
