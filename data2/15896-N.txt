This proposed rulemaking must not be adopted. In short, it will further encourage wage discrimination against U.S. citizens because of flagrant abuse of the existing H1-B program.

Discussion:
Foreign STEM workers are commonly used to dilute the market value of U.S. citizens with STEM skills and experience, improving corporate profitability by manipulating government policies instead of their own business practices.

As documented extensively and readily available via Internet search, the H1-B program is currently the main vector of this end-run around immigration and labor law. Expanding the loopholes to F-1 visa holders will compound the problem while avoiding the toxic political fall-out of raising the statutory limit of H1-B imports.

U.S. policies must benefit U.S. citizens first, last, and always. This program has no obvious or direct benefit to the American people although the benefit to a narrow range of businesses operating in America is obvious. 

Summary:
This proposed rulemaking must not be adopted. 

It is misguided and damaging to the economic well-being of the U.S. public. It favors a narrow slice of corporations operating at the expense of the American people who are deprived employment due to wage discrimination. It must not be approved and it must not be implemented.
