Fahim Ahmed I strongly support this rule for the betterment of US economy..I strongly believe the F-1 Non immigrant Students With STEM Degrees are having a major positive impact in US industries when they join after achieving their degrees. Also F-1 Non immigrant Students are creating new possibilities, advancing science & technological sectors of USA through their research work.
