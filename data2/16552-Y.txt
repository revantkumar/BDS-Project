To whom it may concern,

I would like to strongly encourage the passage of the above rule regarding training and job opportunities for qualified visa holders. This is a valuable program that benefits thousands of hard-working and deserving students and employees by making US residency possible. Many are now in jeopardy of seeing their hard work and livelihoods erased over a procedural issue which can be rectified by this proposed rule. 

Please pass this rule and keep educated and hard-working immigrants as legal US residents.

Regards,
