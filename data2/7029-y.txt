Rebecca Bond You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership and quantitative skills. STEM-related disciplines are responsible for many of the societal innovations that make our world better. International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
