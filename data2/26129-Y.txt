I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. I have graduated with a master degree and am currently looking for a job. I found out that during the process of looking for the job, lots of companies don't belong to E-verified companies list and I believe there are sufficient job positions for students who are U.S citizens. If the extension for OPT get cancelled, I will have to leave after a couple of months. I believe everyone who comes to the U.S. should have the right of having an American dream, and I deeply believe American government should and be able to protect this right out of the spirit of fairness and freedom.
