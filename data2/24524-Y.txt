I actively support the proposal of new opt extension. Finding a job in U.S is not easy for everyone. I'm an engineer right now and I know that U.S citizens have already benefit a lot when they took the interview. The interview always decrease the interview difficulties for U.S citizens. So right now some people just think that they should be considered first but they don't know they are already the priority 1. What I can say is too young to simple, sometimes naive.
