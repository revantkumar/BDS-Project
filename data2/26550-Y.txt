I support this rule.
I read some comments about how this rule would actually have bad influence on American workers.
Well, first of all, local workers actually would have better chances for getting an employment, if they are outstanding enough.
In fact, it is very hard for an international student to get a job in America.
Just imagine if this rule is cancelled, it will be bad for the economy and technology industry in America, since it sends lots of great employees back to their country. 
Then, what is the point of educating lots of international students, and then sending them back to benefits their home country?
