I am against the proposal.
First, the expansion of training for NON-immigrant students is essentially enhancing their intention, ability and opportunities to WORK and stay in the US, which contradicts the underlying principle of the F-1 VISA that is for "academic studies" without "intention to stay" in the US. 
Second, this is an outsourcing of American jobs to foreign nationals who did not prove their loyalty and have no security clearance. Instead the training opportunities, if offered for American students and citizens, could provide many more eligible Americans with income and less tax burden for our government.
