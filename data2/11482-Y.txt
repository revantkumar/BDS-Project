The following reasons why I strongly support expanding the OPT Stem Extension to 24 months.

1. I work at a small start up and have had a huge impact on its success because of the skills I gained at graduate school. My employer wants to keep me and THEY ARE NOT KEEPING ME BECAUSE OF CHEAP LABOR, but because of my SKILLS. By removing OPT STEM, the business I work at will suffer as a result. Is this what DHS wants?

1. Student's from all over the world will not prefer going to USA for their higher education because of the lack of work opportunities they will receive. Displacing 50,000 OPT STEM Students will create a negative impact for foreign students.
The result will be international students shrinking in number to some of the top universities and everyone knows how much international students contribute to the economy. 

2. If OPT STEM should be cancelled because because US workers are loosing their jobs over cheap labor, then H1B should be cancelled as well. In fact, H1B is being far more abused then OPT STEM. I don't understand why opponents don't critique the H1B program instead. 

DHS should create policies that deter companies (mostly consulting companies) that abuse this program. However, this should not be the reason why I and 50,000 skilled STEM students should be displaced.
