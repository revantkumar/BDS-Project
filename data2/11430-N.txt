I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. It is pathetic that the administration is so keen on backing this program with such an emergency and even extending it to 36 months vs the previous 29 months. 

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. 

With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. If at all this program is allowed to continue, it should be for 12 months as a post-graduation training for studying in a US university and should not be allowed to avoid any taxes that a US citizen pays to create a level playing field.
