The proposed regulation will further reduce the number of high tech jobs for US Graduating College students and it gives companies $12K per year tax reduction for alien graduates over US citizens! This and other programs like H1-B are stealing high tech jobs from US Citizens and are allowing businesses to reduce costs by bringing aliens to take citizens' jobs! 

This is another program to downgrade the importance of US citizens' jobs and has resulted in record low full time employment, lowest percentage since 1967! This is another Obama plan to degrade America and to remove the history of exceptional production and economic growth! This plan is disgusting!!
