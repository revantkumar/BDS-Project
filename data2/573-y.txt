David Rowley This proposed rule is one more knife in the back of the American worker. OPT workers often hold jobs in my salary range ($60,000-$90,000/year) but cost Social Security around $1 billion dollars per year. Our Social Security system is almost irreparably broken. This would be the straw which breaks the camel's back for the Social Security system and for all who will depend on it. Please withdraw this proposal and never consider such a damaging rule in the future.
