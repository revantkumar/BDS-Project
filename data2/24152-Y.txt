I strongly support this rule. Fair chance for everybody and the immigrant-friendly culture are the very spirit of US that makes US one of the best countries in the world. This rule follows the spirit and definitely will attract more talented students to US to continue their education. And this rule will also benefit both large and small scale tech companies in the long run and thus create much more job opportunities. It's more about promoting US economy and education instead of taking away jobs from Americans. I really appreciate DHS to bring up this proposal! Big thumb!
