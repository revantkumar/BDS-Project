How will this rule/regulation be anymore effective than the existing Laws that the Executive branch won't enforce and actively prevents State/Local jurisdictions from following? All I see in this is additional costs and no benefits to US Citizens because present Law Enforcement is being suppressed. This appears to be yet another way to bypass Congress and the Legislative branch.
