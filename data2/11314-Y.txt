The STEM extension is a very beneficial policy. There are hundreds of thousands of STEM major students currently are working in the United States and are making great contributions to the US economy. Students with highly specialized knowledge in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics fields are scarce human resources and are valuable assets to US companies. Given the severe situation on the working visa, STEM OPT extension is a necessary work around to help US companies not to lose these workers with expertise. Therefore, for the benefits of US companies and US economy the extension should be applied.
