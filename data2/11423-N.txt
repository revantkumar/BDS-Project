This OPT program and the H1B Visa programs are just a trick by companies to hire cheap foreign labor at below market rates. 
When you see programs such as these and the outsourcing to jobs to India via companies like Southern California Edison, Sun 
Trust Bank and countless others. This is just another example of companies selling out the home workers for a profit and 
government doing their bidding.

If companies want to use these programs, they need to hire an equal number of American workers. If as they say they cannot
qualified workers, they should be required to train that worker. This will show good will and the intent not to outsource local
workers.
