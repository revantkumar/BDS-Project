I support this proposal. US is a country of immigrations. We are strong because we attract the smartest people in the world, and make them one of us. Generations of immigrants made great contribution to our country. We simply can't drive the smartest students away in fear of competitions. If we keep doing this, we will become weaker overtime, and lose our leadership in the world. What's the point to spend our best resources to educate them and then simply force them to leave? We are in a tech revolution, and the STEM students are in great need by our tech industry. Keeping them and helping them to stay will definitely benefit the US in the long run.
