Reddy Ashok Padmaraju Implementing this new OPT rule is absolutely important for the International students who graduated from the US colleges. I see many of those who commented opposing the rule by saying "Americans need jobs". I have lot of American friends who got jobs immediately after graduating because companies thought they deserve those positions. The International students are not stealing jobs that belong to American students. Instead of being away from home thousands of miles away, we are spending tens of thousands of dollars for studies and we work very hard for a successful career and those who outperformed should get a chance to show his skills in industry level. If America doesn't show future for International students, then most of the students will look for alternatives in other countries and this might be one of the factors affecting GDP. Companies who think there is no enough skilled labor will transfer the job to the offshore rather than giving job to any unskilled/under-skilled labor. This might affect the country's economy negatively in many ways. So, I request you to see the pain of International students and implement the rule accordingly. We love America and we always proudly say that we are graduating here. Please give a hope for the future International students that there are wide range of opportunities by improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students.
