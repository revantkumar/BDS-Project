I'm in the information-technology recruiting space. I can assure you, the OPT should not be expanded. This is just a ticket to the U.S. I see daily hundreds of US born graduates who are underemployed and unemployed. It's tragic. Then these opt candidates are eventually H1 sponsored and have resumes that are entirely falsified with regards to their employment history and experience. These sponsors know how to create good resumes and coach the folks into jobs that should be going to U.S. Students at far cheaper rates!! It's beyond ridiculous. I lived this injustice daily. I have a masters degree in technology. The falsification is real. Minimize the opt, expand US contracts to hire recent graduates that are U.S. Citizens instead. Give our children hope, a chance, and a job one they deserve.
