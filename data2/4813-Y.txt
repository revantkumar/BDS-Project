I strongly support the proposal!
The 24 months extension of OPT is not only a chance for a lot of international students, it's more critical for those U.S. employers, especially those transnational companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple. As long as those companies want to keep their competitiveness, they need those people who know the world better than they do. International employees usually have much more sophisticated background across different cultures. With the help of those international employees, these companies can recognize much more chance. 
Now the question is, is that difficult to recruit the international employees? Of course, yes. We know how crucial the H1B draw is. Which makes the OPT period extremely important to the international students and also to the U.S. employers.
The extension of OPT will largely help those companies to recruit the international students. This is a very helpful proposal to all U.S. enterprises.
