For those who complain STEM students grab job opportunities from local people, did you ever research labor market?

If an employer have a choice between an international student and a native student, assuming that their competence are similar, there is no doubt that the native student will be chosen.

Only when the employer could not find ideal candidates in domestic, he could consider sponsoring an international student to fit this position because sponsorship is a huge cost to employer and contains a lot of risk. That is why most of companies do not offer sponsorship at all.

So for a native student, if he meet the requirements of jobs, obviously company will choose him instead of any international students because company would not need to sponsorship him. If he could not meet the requirement, even though those international students were kicked out, company still wont hire him.

International students only fit in those job opportunities that native students could not fit in. So there is no bad impact for the domestic labor market.

In the end, for those international students, even though they are not citizens, they still need to pay all taxes like citizens. And those taxes, collected by the government from non-citizens, serve citizens.
