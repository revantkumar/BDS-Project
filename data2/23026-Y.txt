OPT STEM should be strongly APPROVED!!! It's against the interest and welfare of American people to simply deprive the right of international students to work in USA because they are not US citizens. International students are making great contributions to US. Most of them in STEM majors are top talents in tech industries. Many of them are not satisfied just working for big tech companies, they want to use the knowledge they learned in school to solve more problems in US. They work hard day and night to create more startups in US. Not only will those new startups bring more working opportunities to the states, the new technology and products created by those startup will continuously make US the leader in technology. All they need from US government is just a legal status for them to work in the US and that's all. Hard work needs time to be paid off.

I have an international student friend who just founded this social media company called Plenry (https://plenry.com/). Most of the activity participants are Americans and some of the core founding members are Americans too. My friends uses up all of her OPT STEM time to found this company. Imagine if OPT STEM if cancelled, such kind of creation and innovation will become fewer and fewer in United State. 

American people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.
