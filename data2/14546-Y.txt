I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities.

In addition, these students can develop strong relationships with companies and organizations that may sponsor them for long-term employment in the U.S., bringing insights and creativity into the country on a permanent basis.
