Thea Shi I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Many people are against of this proposal because of competition. I have to say, yes, competition does exist. But is it a totally bad thing? I don't think so. Even though no international competitors, there are still many native competitors. Competition can make a higher standard, which is good to The USA, and good to people to improve themselves. 

2. International students learns in US, and they also want to and should have the opportunity to contribute to US. 

3. International students spend much more on the tuitions than natives. The only right international students have is paying and no earning? Is this fair?
