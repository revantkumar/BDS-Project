Jessica Paige If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion.
