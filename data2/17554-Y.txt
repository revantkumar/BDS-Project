It is in greater benefit of the US economy and the Science & Tech development if highly trained foreign STEM students are able to transition to being part of the highly skilled and tax paying US workforce rather than taking their training back to their home countries. 

In the current economy, post-graduation to first job time frames of greater than 12 months are very common. A 12-months period is usually not enough for these students to transit to a H1B working visa before their OPT expires. this leaves insufficient time to transition to a work visa before their OPT status expires. Even with the previous 17 month OPT extension it is fairly common that a recently graduated student finds a job a few months before their OPT status expires. So a 24-months period extension is in great help to these STEM students. and it also allows their employers to have enough time to file H1B for them. At the very least, the 24 months extension window would greatly facilitate transition from student to worker. 

In a nutshell, The proposed extension of the OPT status extension from 17 to 24 months would provide significant benefit to the US economy by providing sufficient time for highly trained foreign STEM student to both find entry level first jobs in the US, to develop sufficient competency to be a sustained part of the US workforce and help avoid jobloss due to limited application windows for a work visa.
