Xu Han I strongly support this OPT extension rule for the following reasons:
1. It is American's spirit to give everyone equal chance. Talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.
2. Those who oppose this proposal says the rule will affect their job. However, this is nonsense. The number of jobs for native US citizens will not change at all, no matter the OPT extend or not. And the jobs should be given to the one who deserves them, not "take care" some citizens.
3. It is good for US economy to have talented foreign people to work in US. Just think about what will happen if there is no foreign students can stay after graduation.
4. The longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
