I'm from China. 

In Beijing I worked in a Public Relations agency, with colleagues from Norway, France, Brazil... and US. 

A couple I knew are also Americans, they came from North Carolina and have lived in Shanghai for seven years. 

They all chose to stay in China because they want to. They love China. And they can stay as long as they want. 

I love US. 

And I think what makes US unique is its openness. 

US brought in lots of geniuses during and after World War II, which benefited the universities greatly. How many Nobel prizes are won directly or indirectly by them? 

OPT extension is just an opportunity for students to stay another two years to practice. It's not even close to immigration. 

Even in a country where how many babies their citizens can have is restricted, still they have a friendly policy for foreign workers. 

So why can't the United States of America? The country of equal human rights and opportunities?
