(1) YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension. 
(2) I believe OPT-extension if NECESSARY for our country. 
(3) YES, OPT-extension would be in the best interest of our nation.

Firstly, over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tramendous growth to the USA economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen. Without the embraciveness of foreign workers, I can foresee someday very soon when USA economy stagnates, people lose jobs, and social problems arises. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.

In addition, The request to place the right of citizens over non-citizens is simply RIDICULOUS. Just remember, every citizen or their ancestor once was an immigrant. 

What's more, As someone experienced in the tech industry, I can tell you with my reputation that the tech companies can never hire enough talents these days. Go ask the hiring managers and recruiters, they will tell you the same. Yes, USA probably has a lot of STEM people, but it simply does not have enough STEM talents. See, there is a distinction between normal people and talents. USA needs the talents from foreign workers to keep its machines running well, and running better than the rest of the world.
