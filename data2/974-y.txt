Samuel Huntington I would say it is really better to see this pass for everyone's best. I have some friends from oversea when I was in college, they pay higher tutions and had to work hard since English is not their first language. The ones I know who can find decent jobs after graduation are really outstanding in what they do. I really don't see why the government should prevent them serve in the work force with their expertise. Not only this, they are paying tax which will benefit not them but the United States. So again this is a win win situation. Hope the court will make the right decision.
