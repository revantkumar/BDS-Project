Totally support this excellent policy. As it will not only benefit the foreign students, but also benefit the U.S. a lot. Foreign students with Master's or PhD's degree would bring young and creative blood to local companies in the U.S.,help these facilities grow better and stronger, so that more employee position would be created for the local U.S. citizens. Meanwhile, the flexible visa policies will attract more foreign students to the U.S. to pursue advanced knowledge and technology. Followed is more international travelers, including parents of the students. Their consumption needs of tourism and luxury goods will indubitably benefit the U.S. economy.
