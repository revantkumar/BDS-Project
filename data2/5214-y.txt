varun subramanian I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I Love contributing to Innovation and American Economy. I love the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.

The tech industry has a huge deficit of talented workforce and STEM OPT is just a way to hold the jobs in USA, otherwise these companies will start setting up offices in other countries, taking the jobs away from america.
