I strongly SUPPORT the rule of the OPT STEM extension and the reasons are as follows:

1. STEM related industries are bringing great and positive contributions to the U.S. every year, and STEM related industries are keeping the U.S. the leading position in the world. The GDP contributed by STEM related industries took about 55% in 2014. Since a few U.S. citizens are willing to do STEM works, international students, who have STEM background, have become the powerful workforce to STEM industries. With the OPT STEM extension rule, more contributions will be brought to the U.S.

2. It is found that a majority of international students choose STEM programs, and the U.S. have invested a large amount of funding for STEM education and industry. (For instance, international students with STEM majors get funding for the TA/RA.) If their OPT lasts only 1 year, it is an immediate loss on educational investment for all U.S. tax payers.

3. A large amount of international students prefer to work for the U.S. because of the longer working duration they were provided by STEM extension rule. Since most projects in industries last more than two years, if the OPT is limited for 1 year, the majority of STEM international employees will be forced to leave before their projects are completed. The core international engineers will forced to give up their contributions for the U.S--rather, they will contribute their abilities and experience to other countries. This will bring a great loss and impacts to various corporations and citizens in the U.S.
