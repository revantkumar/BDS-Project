I'm a math phd student currently studying in Texas originally from China. I don't see why the STEM opt extension should be banned. I have a lot of native American friends who finished their undergraduate or graduate study in STEM majors and then find a good job. They never feel nervous or anxious for competing with foreigners to find a job. Oppositely, they didn't care! They enjoyed working with people from different culture and speaking different languages. This issue here is never about native Americans losing jobs and nonimmigrants grabbing all jobs out there. It's just a parochial thinking from those opponents.
