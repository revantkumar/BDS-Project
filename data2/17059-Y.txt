I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Competition exists, and will continue. Harvard and MIT have the most fierce competition, that's why they are the best. Google and apple have the most competitive atmosphere, that's why they are the best. And now ask me why USA is the best.

2. "Doers make this country". Now you want to cancel the extension because you are afraid you will lose? What will football be, if the players are afraid of failure? Will there be Tesla when Elon Musk can not conquer the fear of losing? Keep calm, carry on, and make this country better.

3. USA is the strongest country because of it's Technology, Military and Economic. Chinese students are a strong force among the all that contribute to the Technology legendary of United States. It will be a great lose for USA, if we Chinese students learn everything and go straight back to our country.

Besides, it's only 3 years. We won't stay here forever, we have a better country to build.
