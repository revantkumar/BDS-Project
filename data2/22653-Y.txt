I strongly agree with the rule. There are two reasons. One is that will promote American economic if the international student have job in America. It will help America build up a good trade with other foreign countries. Another reason is that will improve the quality of jobs. If there are more international students, it will have competition, so it will improve American students' sence of crises, and it is good for company even for country.
