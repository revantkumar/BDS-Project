Cora Chen To whom it may concern,

I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. I am an international student. Before I came to the US, I had chance to go to schools in England, Canada, Singapore etc. when I was applying for schools. I ended up coming to US because I think I have better opportunities to put what I have learned in school into practice due to the OPT STEM extension policy. If the STEM OPT is not extended to 24 months, and even worse, if it will become less than 17 months, the U.S. will not be able to attract international students, or it will attract significantly less international students. Thus, there will be a significant decrease in number of students in the U.S. universities and the U.S. will experience the lack of qualified employees in science, engineering and technology related areas.

This is also important to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness. For many companies, their projects would last at least two years. If the OPT period is too short, employees cannot finish their project and companies will need to spend more money and time to seek for other employees.

In addition, US employers will benefit a lot from the STEM students. For example, many US companies such as Facebook and Uber are trying to open their markets in other countries. International students can bring more insight knowledge of markets in their home countries, which can benefit both the US companies and US economic in a long run.
In general, the extension of 17 months of STEM OPT to 24 months is a win-win situation both for the U.S. and the international students studying in this great country.

Thanks!
