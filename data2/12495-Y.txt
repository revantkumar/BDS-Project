I strongly support this new rule. The comment that this rule hurts US citizens' job opportunities is non-sense. For one thing, the extension is only part of the students' practical training, and does not grant the student indefinite work authorization; for another, the US benefits from the high skilled foreign workers. It is very simple: we used our education resource to train these students, shouldn't we get something in return for the training? In my opinion, the OPT provides exactly this. So, we as a country benefits from the training provided to those international students.
