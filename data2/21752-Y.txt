I believe that 12 months + 24 months extension time is essential for OPT program. In my opinion, most large research/software development projects would last more than 1 years or more. Without the extension time, research institutes or companies hesitate to hire graduates in these programs and would miss these talented STEM workers. In this case, the competitive strength of the US companies is undermined and finally hurts the strength of the US.
