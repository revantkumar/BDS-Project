I strongly support this proposal.
I'm a phd student from Asia. My PhD advisor who is a distinguished professor also coming from Asia. If there was no STEP extension, my advisor could not be a professor in America, and our lab(more than 20 people) will not exist. And our studied area cannot be prosper.
