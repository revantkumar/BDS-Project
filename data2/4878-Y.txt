Strongly support OPT extension. United States was formed by immigrants; giving highly educated, high-skill students a chance to work here and contribute to our prosperity is the least we could do to continue that tradition and to make our country even greater. Let's keep our proud American spirit and keep attracting the best talents from around the world!
