I strongly support this proposal, and i am shocked when someone in the america want to cancel it.
The reason why US is the best and strongest counrty in the world is only one reason for all this long time, Freedom. And it is also this reason that attract so many students of elites from other countries. In all about 200s years history of america, no one can deny the contributions of the foreigers, especially the international students who in the future will become the most powerful strength in contributing this great country. If now US government steps a wrong way to deny this proposal, that will be not only a huge depress on the development of the this great country, but also a big defiance to the constitution of this country!
