I think Public Health (51.2299) should definitely be included into STEM list. Here are several reasons.

1. As students whose major are Public Health, we are required to perform scientific studies that include plenty of quantitative analysis as well as computer programming. Therefore, Public Health definitely falls into "STEM" category.

2. Majors like epidemiology(26.1309), biostatistics(26.1102) and environmental health(51.2202) all belong to STEM list. These are all sub-majors under Public Health. However, Public Health itself in not in the list. This is not logical and reasonable.

3. Graduates from public health major are currently working in different healthcare areas including hospitals, healthcare research institutes and pharmaceutical/biotech companies. We are contributing to human health and are highly in demand.
