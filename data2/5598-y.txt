Joshua Zhang I strongly support this rule for the following two reasons:

1. Just look at the numbers of immigrants in Sillicon valley, you will know how much contributions are immigrants are making. With the fast development of information technology, more and more high quality IT professionals are needed. And talented international students in STEM major are a major source. Most international students in STEM major are top talents in their own countries. This rule will be a great boost to the IT companies in Sillicon Valley.

2. With a good OPT regulation, US colleges will attract more international students, which brings a tremendous economic opportunities to local business. In 2014, according to Department of Commerce: international students contributed over 27 billion dollars to the US economy. With this new rule, I believe this number will continue to grow.
