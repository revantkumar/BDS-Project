I fully support the proposed rule of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant student with STEM degrees. The American market is having a great demand upon these student with corresponding STEM majors. This proposed rule will provide significant benefit to American economy by helping high tech company expansion and creating more jobs. In addition, this rule will help USA keep as the top country by keep the most competitive STEM human resource in the world.
