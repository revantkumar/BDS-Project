I am a restaurant holder living in Pittsburgh. I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. The most important reason is that this policy will attract more foreign students to come and attend American universities. My restaurant is near CMU and Pitts, so most of my customers are foreign students. Recent years, with the increasing of foreign student amount, I expanded my restaurant and hired another three employees. I think all these improvements can attribute to foreign students cause Pittsburgh is not a big city and we need new residents to keep this city flourishing. Besides, a short OPT will definitely weaken foreign students' enthusiasm to study here. I am really afraid to see that because I cannot afford current employees if there is significant customer lose.
