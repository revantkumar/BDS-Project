As a US born STEM worker, I strongly support this proposal. 
The U.S. job market is not a "zero-sum game" in which workers must fight each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has the most dynamic and powerful economy the world has ever known, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked shoulder to shoulder with native-born workers to build it.
