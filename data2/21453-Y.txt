Government people fail to realize that they run on the path to destroy the very government that pays them so handsomely. This is just another example. These "students" will take their knowledge back to their country to compete against America; these "students" will send their incomes back home to their families. Obviously, this further hampers American citizens who cannot obtain employment. When citizens no longer retain an income, just who is going to pay for those handsome paychecks that government people receive?
