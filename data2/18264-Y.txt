I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal. There are some important reasons,

1, First, I cannot agree with the saying that the international students finding the jobs can have the negative effect on the domestic students, because most of the STEM jobs are still in shortage, which means the employers cannot find the right candidates due to large demand to the tech workers.

2. Then, I believe most of the international students still want to go back tot heir own countries after the OPT, so it is the perfect way to make contribution to the US economy.
