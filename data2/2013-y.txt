Xiaochen Li This proposed rule is inspiring and has been widely spread in F-1 students community in U.S.. We are very happy that U.S. is helping us F-1 students in finding jobs as the current job marketing is not as good as years ago that lots of good jobs the employers don't sponsor H1-B visa or simply require citizenship. 

STEM F1 students do need this period of time with possible extension to locate jobs that fit themselves. Reviewing the contribution done by F-1 students, this proposed rule will be a good investment and will stimulate the job marketing in a long run.
