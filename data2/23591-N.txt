I am a retired teacher. After years of parental and teacher counseling our young people to achieve science, technological, engineering, and medical educations so they can have a more comfortable life style (and pay more taxes) we have our own government shoot us all down!!

We have plenty of stem workers. you are supposed to support our own citizens--not bow to the big contributors Zuckerberg, Disney, etc so they can
fire Americans and pay oriental immigrants a fraction of AMerican wages.
