The United States is leading the world due to its advantage in technology and finance, both of which need a lot of employees with STEM degree. While hiring international students actually cost more than hiring american citizens, firms are still keeping recruiting F-1 nonimmigrant students, this shows a shortage of ppl with STEM degree, hence I am in favor of this rule, not just to allow students able to gain more experience after graduation, but also to help the country keep more talents and keep its techonology and finance advantage over the world.
