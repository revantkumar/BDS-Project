This is a great policy!!

First,according to research, the supply of domestic STEM labor force is significantly less than the demand of the STEM labor force in the market. The STEM OPT Extension will help the market to get more foreign STEM labor force and help the market to reach the market equilibrium. 

Second, the policy will attract more international students to come to the U.S., which will definitely push the economic growth because foreign students need to pay tuition fee and spend money in the U.S., thus increasing GDP growth.
