I definitely SUPPORT this petition to offer longer OPT extension for STEM students trained in America.
If you look into those new, high-tech industries, yes you will see several big figures with outstanding wisdom and leadership. But those big figures, need an army to succeed. Database managers, statisticians, electrical engineers, software and hardware developers, interface developers...all of them collaborate to produce a wonderful product which will serve for the mutual good of all America, even all the world.
Minimum wage? No, they have nothing to do with minimum wage. What they do requires high expertise and years of training, most likely, mentally. This training is not cheap, and their pursuit of career goal shall not be paid in a cheap manner. What they do is helping all of us getting a better, more convenient, and more exciting life.
Our life is overwhelmed by Internet now. How could we have such level of convenience of receive Amazon service, Google suggestions, home smart appliances,etc. without international students? Those students study hard and work hard to bring technology and idea into reality, it would be so stupid to drive them away!
American people are wise. We shall let these students work, and providing them with necessary aid. Again, they are not cheap labors.
