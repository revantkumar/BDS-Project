In my opinion, this rule is a concrete step to make USA economy sustainable and stronger for the coming decades due to following reasons:

1) The international students bring a ton of foreign revenue to the U.S.A., which is the back bone of the many public Universities. This money is used to fund research projects at universities as the funds provided by NSA and private companies can not reach to each and every public University in the U.S.A. These funds create millions of jobs in the higher educations sector.

2) Having the STEM OPT extension after graduation attracts the next generation of overseas students as well as it allows them to practice their skills in the U.S.A.. If overseas students do not have this STEM extension then they are likely to pursue their higher studies in some other countries like Australia, Canada, Germany.

3) The U.S.A. Universities bread so many students with STEM degree each year. These talented students go and work for the U.S.A. based companies like Google / Facebook / Amazon / Apple which are the backbone of US economy.

4) Some of these students create the next generation of Google / Facebook and create millions of jobs in the U.S.A.

5) Number of US citizens graduating with STEM degree are not sufficient enough to fill the openings at all these IT companies. But companies like Microsoft, Akamai, Google, Linkedin, Facebook, Uber and many more do have to run. If they can not find all the needed labor then those jobs will be outsourced to other countries and the U.S.A. will lose the revenue on taxes from these companies.

6) In general, this rule attracts some of the brightest students around the world to come to USA, spend their most youthful time in this country and help shape this country.
