Since the chance of winning the H-1B lottery is at historical low, this 24 months STEM extension is really valuable to international students. It would greatly improve the chance of these highly educated internationals to secure a job and a work Visa. This is also critical to the U.S, whose technology sector is highly dependent on these international talents. In conclusion, this 24-months extension would be best for both international students and the United States until a major work visa/immigration reform is implemented.
