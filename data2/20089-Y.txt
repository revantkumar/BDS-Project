If "ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States" really is the goal of this United States, then this proposal would definitely help from certain perspectives.

As a Chinese STEM student on extension, I learned that many employers, especially small companies, are not willing to deal with the complication of OPT (alien status rather). Don't even have to mention the notorious Cap Gap. Even if I do find employers willing to overlook these extra hiring efforts, the thing that worries me most is that I may suddenly have to leave the job that I'm getting better at, and get kicked out of US, because I didn't making it to the H1B "lottery". These complication of OPT, among many other facts, have largely reduced foreign students' chance of getting practical training.

Extending STEM extension period and Cap Gap relief would ensure most students have three opportunities to file for an H1B application, and not sweat TOO MUCH during their H1B application.

However, "the implementation of formal mentoring and training plans by employers" seems not be adding the odds for us. Should this rule goes into effect, all employers are forced to start such a program. Don't get me wrong, it would be fantastic, nevertheless, the US government should be educating companies and organizations to adopt such a practice and thus attracting international STEM students, rather than restraining our choice of employers.
