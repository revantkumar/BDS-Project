The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix. 

Haven't we done enough to prevent American workers from getting jobs. First with illegal immigrants taking our work, changing the languages we need to speak to get work (do you know how many job applications I have to pass up because they require bi-lingual Spanish now? It was never like that 10 years ago.), and now this extension of foreign workers that can stay even longer and work cheaper. It's time to put a stop to this and Make America Great Again!
