Dear Department of Homeland Security,

I myself is an international student currently pursuing my master of science degree in Petroleum Engineering at Colorado School of Mines. This is my sixth year in the United States as a student, while six years ago I came to the United States as an cultural exchange high school student and stayed with a host family in Windsor, Connecticut. Throughout my cultural exchange year, I had the opportunity to study US history and culture, sing in the local church choir with my host brothers and sisters, and join the local high school swimming team. 

It is that year of culture exchange as international student that completely changed my life, for the first time ever I have the chance to communicate with friends from another nation, to learn what they are learning and to see what they are seeing. I have feel the sense of peacefulness while singing and praying in the local church choir, I have learned the spirit of teamwork as a swimmer in the high school swimming team, and I have the honor to be actually accepted by a American family as part of the family members for the culture exchange year. From the local US high school, we learned the American dream, that every US citizen should have an equal opportunity to achieve success and and prosperity through hard work, determination, and initiative. Though I'm not an US citizen, yet I do believe in hard work, determination and initiative, and that's the reason I choose to apply for college in the US and studying Petroleum Engineering, and hoping that someday I can also achieve my "American dream".

I understand that there are people claiming against the extension of OPT, since they think international students had taken many job opportunities of many local US citizens. To my opinion, the extension of OPT is just an opportunity for international students to try to apply for jobs in the US, and also limited to the STEM majors, which requires hard-works in science, maths and other engineering t
