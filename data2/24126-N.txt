The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a serious hinderance to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates, seeking jobs in their fields. The program would encourage U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a decent salary. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American technology workers, not against it. Personally, I work in the tech field and have two soon-to-graduate daughters who will be looking for jobs in engineering and information technology. It is grossly unfair to American born and educated young graduates to have to compete for jobs where this rule is in place.
