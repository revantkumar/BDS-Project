I support this proposal for the following reasons: 
1. As the history clearly shows that, the international talents have made great contributions to the USA, especially the STEM areas. 
2. Current the high tech companies need huge amount of skilled human resource to develop the latest technology, and only the american native workers are not enough to fulfill the whole positions. 
3. The International STEM workers are devoting themselves to make the US a stronger country, they doing their work well, they pay a lot of taxes, they help the people in the company....
4. To be an engineer, the company need to spend at least 6 month to train a new employee, if the OPT period is only 1 year or less, it will do a great harm to the companies. 
Overall, the all man are created equal, it is the spirit of the US, I believe that if this proposal can be passed, it will definitely good for the US economy and technology development. 

So, please let this proposal pass, thanks.
