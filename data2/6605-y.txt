Connie Hu Expanding the training time for international students with stem major is a win-win!!
I am a graduated students with a stem major. I am currently working in a health care related company and our project is highly related to what I learned from school. This training opportunity helps me a lot to apply my ability to the real world. And this is very critical for myself as a student who get education from US. Practical training and education from school can't be separate, and this is a good way to attract more international students come to US to get high level education. For my company, I made money for them. My role in the team is critical for the company to grow and more importantly for improving the healthcare service for all the US citizens!! This is really a win-win: I have opportunity and time to practice my learning from school while at the same time the company I am working for get benefit. Currently the length of OPT is 1 year which is not enough for a series of projects to be done, especially for my company. We normally have big projects which requires the contribution of 2-3 years. I highly support the idea of expanding the training time for us and please!!!
