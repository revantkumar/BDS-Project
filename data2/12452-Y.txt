STEM extension is really required . In my case I work for a small firm where within 6 months I was one of the productive and important member of the team. After 1 year I would play a major role. Without stem extension my team would be at a major loss and in turn my company I work for. And also the STEM extension training and mentoring program is also to be revived as I cannot resubmitting the same forms/documents again and again to DSO and wait for the DSO response in a dilemma. Companies would be reluctant to hire STEM extension candidates if this tranining and mentoring program comes into effect.
