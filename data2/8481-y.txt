Connor Qiu I think it is quite wise to extend the training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degree, since after they get the strong training in US they are super qualified to help the industry boost their business, and unfortunately, most of them have to leave because of the VISA issue which is not a good case for both the students and the employers, for the students they lose the chance to work with companies using their knowledge learned here, and for the companies they probably will lose the talented workers, since most students study aboard are truly exceptional.
