For whom may concerned,

Please let OPT extension implement. Why? 
First, foreign employees are tightly related to US economics. We are young professionals and full of knowledge. Most of us have talented skills. Working in US not only let us can apply our knowledge and skills but also help employers solve their problems and help their company growth. 
Second, special professional employees in United stats are shortage. Some jobs have to be performed special skills such as science, technology, engineering and math. Foreign employees are willing to help out, and perform their talents. 
That is mutual benefits!!! Thus, please let us have our rights to work.

We will really appreciate the wise decisions from the court and from the USICS
