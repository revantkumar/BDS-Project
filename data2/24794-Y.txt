I strongly support the proposed STEM OPT rule for the following reasons

U.S. will suffer from tremendous financial loss by revoking old STEM OPT
rule and failing to publish new one.

Currently there are over 400000 STEM students studying in U.S. either in a 2
years master degree or in a 4 years undergraduate degree. The average
tuition per year they spend is $30000. Totally U.S. education system
receives 400000 * 30000 = 12000000000 = 12 billion USD per year. One of the
most important reasons they choose U.S. for receiving advanced education is
because it provides the best after-school training opportunity (17 months
STEM OPT). If U.S. education system can not provide STEM OPT extension in
the future. It will lose in the competition against other countries that are
providing it. Considering that a large portion of STEM students will
abandon their future plan to study in U.S. That is a huge impact on the
current U.S. education ecosystem that has already adapted to wide
internationalization.

Also STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident. H1B
does. Don't blame at the wrong thing.
