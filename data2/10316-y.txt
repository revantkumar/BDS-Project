Bhargav Yarrakula I would seriously appreciate if the rule comes to effect as soon as possible because there are many students who spend a lot of money for their studies and many leave their job for their interest in studies in the U.S. Given a chance to them they would definitely help the U.S economy in many ways to get better. Hope it comes to effect asap.

I would never forget the one who spent some money on me for my better living.
