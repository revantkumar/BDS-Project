To The Leaders of ICE:

Stop the expansion of the F-1 program. It is your duty as employees of the citizens of the United States,
to first and foremost protect our borders and enforce all existing immigration laws. It is not your duty, nor do you have the authority to overwrite laws that were passed by the U.S. Congress.

There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree, many of whom are unemployeed. Put these people back to work before lower paid foreign STEM tech workers.

Sincderely,

Leon Donahue
