Sarah Smith As a professor at University of Minnesota, I strongly support the 24 month extension rule. 

Most postdoc fellows working in academia are international students. Without the OPT extension, lots of them will leave the country without finishing their ongoing projects, which will be a huge waste of NSF and NIH funding. Professors are not able to find enough US citizen PhD students to continue their work since most of them are going to industry with higher salary. Beside technology companies, Universities will also expect a huge effect by failing to implement the new OPT extension rules.
