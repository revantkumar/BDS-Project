As a HR in high-tech industry, I strongly support this proposal.
It would unimaginable if the foreign students, who have been making great contribution to the industry, have to leave U.S. after the 12-month OPT. The current number and qualification of local high-tech workforce cannot meet the increasing demands of companies. It would definitely a great loss to IT industry in U.S. if we let the foreign students go to work for our competitors outside U.S.
