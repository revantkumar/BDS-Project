Lee Douglas This is just wrong! There will not be enough oversight to ensure that the students are not paid a wage much lower than an American citizen. In addition, why should foreign students be guaranteed a mentor when american students are not? This is simply another way to make more cheap labor available to American companies instead of hiring an American citizen at a decent wage.
