I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1)International students make great contribution to the American society. For example, a lot of graduate students work in many fields such as chemical engineering, computer science, statistics, which greatly improves the advancement of American technology. Some international students even create new jobs for the society. It is a good way to lower the unemployment rate.

2)The extension of opt does good to American education. As far as I known, after the opt of post-docs in American universties are expired, they have no choice but return their countries. However, they get a warm welcome there. Some of them are employed as professors in colleges and work as professional researchers. Equiped with the latest knowledge and technique which are acquired from the American universities, they introduce those knowledge into their new students and colleagues. It is a great loss for the American universities. The government should do something to attract those elite to stay in USA.
