As a prospective student who is pursuing STEM degree in USA, one fundamental criteria for me is how I can get a job in USA and gain valuable experiences. As we know, lots of students are expiated to its own country after graduation from university. It is like a lucky draw, if you cannot be granted a working visa, unfortunately, you only have 1 chance, you are doomed. It poses great stress on international student, and I cannot even use my knowlege leant in USA properly. I believe in American dreams, and I believe every intelligent and hard working people have more than just a chance to live up to their American dreams. Therefore, I strongly support this deal.
