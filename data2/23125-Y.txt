I agree with this rule. I believe this rule is a fair decision for both US workers and international employees because as we can see, only those E-Verified companies can use OPT-Extention to hire international employees. And E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status.
