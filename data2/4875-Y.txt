I support this proposal. It's a good thing to give these well-educated guys a chance.

opt is a very very important element to attract international students, who pay much tuition to support US colleges/universities. (As I know, tuition fee of international students commonly as double as native students.) Not enough native Americans would like or be able to work in STEM (especially in Computer Science/Electronic/Statistic). However whose talented and well-trained international students in OPT status could give a huge contribution to the US high-tech field. So why dont US government give them, also give ourselves an oppotunity to develop both our technology and economy?

Our country is known and respected for diversity and inclusiveness, because of these more people come here to contribute them to the society. Thus the US can have todays international standing and prestige. 

International students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed 26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to NAFSAs latest economic analysis.We can imagine if we lose 1/5 of those STEM international students, we will lose more than 2 billion and more than 30,000 jobs.

The U.S. share of the worlds science and engineering graduates is declining rapidly as
European and Asian universities, particularly from China, have increased S&E degrees while US
degree production has stagnated.(According to http://www.nber.org/papers/w11457.pdf) See? We NEED those smart guys in STEM area.

All in all, I don't think opt extension would hurt native americans benefits, nevertheless it will have lots of positive impacts to the country.
