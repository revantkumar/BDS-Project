Chen Chen I strongly support this rule for the following reasons: 
1. It is in the spirit of America to give everyone equal chance. Talented students who came to US to study deserve more time to practice their skills after graduation and make a difference and contribution to their fields. 
2. Contribution made to US industries will improve the US economy in the long term. 
3. Also, an extended OPT will attract more talented students to study in US.
