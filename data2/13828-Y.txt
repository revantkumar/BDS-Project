I SUPPORT this rule update. 1. STEM means the area where the U.S. need more people to contribute. I don't think the people in those areas take the position of U.S. citizens. 2. Extension rule for STEM is an important reason appeal international students choose US universities instead of Europe or other countries. If no extension, U.S. Universities MUST NOT be competitive as now. 3. 1 year opt is not long enough for students to contribute for their companies especially for STEM industry. So companies hire a new grad and train them for several months. After new grads start to do some projects, a year passed and they have to leave. It is bad for not only a certain company but also the INDUSTRY of US. 4. International students requesting Visa sponsorships will NOT take the position of US citizens. There are a lot of startups in the U.S. which only provide jobs for us citizens. And many other companies prefer US people.In a word, OPT extension is beneficial for US, so I support it.
