Jingtao Han I am a Chinese student studying the data science in France now. For the next year, I will apply to the American universities to further my study in data science. In my opinion, the expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees is quite significant for my personal study as well as the American society. For my side, I would have more chance to find a ideal job matching my level easier if I have more time to spend on it. On the other hand, this policy is also beneficial for the American industrial world, particularly in IT domain. Because data science is recognized as a future job which is very important for the development of the IT world. If we can extend the duration for a young graduate to find a job, he may find his place in a IT company in USA, then he could contribute his effort to the American society. Hence, I am support to the Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.
