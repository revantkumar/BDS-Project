I'm a STEM student. From my view, extension of the OPT benefits the USA greatly.

1. There are many engineers working in high technology companies with F1 - OPT. They are the base of those companies, and potentiality got prompted to be the hard core. Since they are foreigners, they have to work harder than the Americans to get more opportunities. Therefore, these foreigner engineers with F1 - OPT are important to the technology companies.

2. Advanced technology is important for any countries. However, less and less Americans pursue degrees in Engineering, especially in high degrees, masters and PhD. International students make up this gap. They create new technology and develop it to products, which enable the America to keep developed. 

3. The economy of the America just start rebound. Engineers are important to the economy.
