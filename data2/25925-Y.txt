As a PhD student at Ohio State U, I do believe that OPT extension will boost our economy and scientific research. Nowadays most of the native students around me are reluctant to study engineering; at this time, international students came in and filled this gap, especially after 2008, when Obama's OPT bill was put into effect. They have been making huge contributions to our country, working hard, paying same tax as we do. Actually many of them are among the best in their fields. However, current OPT policy (29 months) makes it very hard for them to even finish one project in their companies. To maintain our leadership in both technology and economy, the extension is crucial.

The belief that minimum wages were suppressed by a number of foreign student in US job market is unreasonable. Without them, their work will simply be outsourced to oversea companies, who pay their workers less then 1/3 on average, They are the ones who steal our jobs and bring down our salary. International students, on they other hand, generally have higher expectations in their salary, since they invested a good amount of money in their education.

Diving out the international students is driving out our job creators and innovators. In India and China, a good many new IT companies begin to thrive these years with their founders who studied and worked in the states. If we had made them stay, more working opportunities would have been created.
