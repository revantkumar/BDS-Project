I completely support this. I believe, this is one of the possible ways to encourage people to come to the US , make a place and support for the better of the country. With the increase in number of people applying for H1-B, giving more chances and time to F1 students on OPT is the best thing to happen. Also increasing the quota for h1-B per year would help.
