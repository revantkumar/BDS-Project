I think improving and expanding the OPT Extension for F-1 students with STEM Degrees is a great idea.

This action will definitely attract more international student to come and study in the US, which will balance the diversity of students for higher education organizations, as well as increase the economic benefits. 

As an F-1 STEM student myself, I chose America over Australia and European countries as the country I did by Master's, awaring that I would need to spend more on the tuition, just because America has the best education system for foreign students in the whole world. And OPT and OPT Extension is the most important part of the system. Because foreign students are given chances to practice the knowledge and skills they learned from school for a decent period of time. And practice makes perfect. 

I also don't think that foreign students are "stealing" jobs from American employees. First, if the American employee is good enough, the employer would never risk to hire a foreign student who just graduated from school to replace the American employee. Second, American students who just graduated from school also have great advantages in all kinds of ways. Because growing up in the same culture where they are going to work at has already dug a big gap that foreign students can never cross. If the employer still chooses to hire foreign students, then Americans should find motivations from this situation to increasing their own value, instead of blaming on others. And please, we are talking about legal F-1 Non-immigrant students in this case. This has nothing to do with illegal immigrants. 

I believe America society is a equal society to everyone. The only standard of being chosen or not is whether you are good or not.
