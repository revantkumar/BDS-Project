The 24-month extension of OPT is beneficial for both citizens and non-citizens. It`s obvious that STEM international students wanna to have this period to improve their opportunities to get a job in the US. But this is also helpful to facilitate US economics and developments of US companies.Not only native students, there are lots of talents in international students who can make significant achievements progress in STEM region.This policty will increase the possibility to find those people who can make progress in improving US economics, academics and industries. And to be honestly, it is undeniable that immigrants and non citizens plays an important part in US society, so it`s really important to allocate these people. It`s true that unlawful immigration is dramatically increased by years now,which messes the order of the society and increase the risk of turmoils. With this decision, it will allow students to get more chance to stay in US lawfully, which will reduce unlawful immigration trend. And for citizens that concerned about the lack of jobs for native citizens. This policy did not make it severe at all! Gold will shine everywhere, people who deserve a job will always get a job, no matter he is a citizen or not. Companies always want to hire people who can contribute to them instead of considering if you are a citizen or not. Instead of complaining about internationals occupied your positions, think why you can not beat them? There are already lots of restrictions for internationals to work in US, but you still can not beat them, then it should be your shortness. And if the government just want to give more jobs for citizens and block the way for internationals, then it will only let people become less competitive and aspirant, which will stop US from development.
