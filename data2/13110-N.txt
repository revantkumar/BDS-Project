I can't believe you took millions away from medicare & medicaid to pay for this. Now you're going to take jobs away from Americans, just like that bull at Disneyland. You're really going to bring more foreign aliens here & they won't be required to pay into our social security system. Unbelievably short sighted when we're already talking about cutting benefits. I don't think you people on the government payroll are doing what you are paid to do. How about putting some of the Americans who can't find a job because of this giveaway program back to work instead?
