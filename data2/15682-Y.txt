First of all I would say that it is an execellent proposal for international students. An opt extension will help the foreign students as well as economy of the united students.

Students Benefits :
1. It will provide enough time to recover education expenditure by job salary. Pursuing MS in USA is costly, and people who are coming from developing country cannot pursue it unless they are sure that they will recover the cost.

2. Cosidering the lottery system of h1b work visa, students will have more chance to win.

Benefits of United States:

1. Economy of the country depends of skilled work force and no country can be independent in this field, so foreign intelligence will provide cutting edge in Global market.

2. Cultural diversity.
3. USA can provide oppurtunity to become citizen of USA who are truly valuable.

So, I vote for opt extension.
