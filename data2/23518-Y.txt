OPT is life saving to me. I don't want to talk too much about big ideas such as equality, freedom ect. I only want to talk about myself. I am graduating in 6 months, looking for a full time position in this country. I love this country for a variety of reasons that I think many of you might be able to make a correct guess. However, there are other motivations for me to fight hard to stay in this country. My mom got her master degree in the US and fell in love with this country. However, due to the fact that her love to my dad is stronger than her love to US, she left this country with regret. I am carrying her dream. My girlfriend whom I really love, wants to stay in the US and have three babies. This is not okay with Chinese government. I fight hard to stay in this country because I don't want to see my loved ones feel disappointed.
