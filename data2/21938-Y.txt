I completely agree and fully support the replacement of the 17 months of OPT extension with 24 months. Students all over the world see the United States as the most technologically advanced society with the state of the art facilities and that is their motivation to choose this country for their educational pursuits. Yes, the educational system has given us everything, the laboratories here are well advanced taking our knowledge level to a new high. Knowledge, as it is, is like a seed but for the seed to grow, bloom, and finally to become the tallest tree it needs the right environment, needs constant nurturing and on the top of everything it needs to adapt. Universities and colleges here do an outstanding job sowing the seed but unless the seed sees the light of the day it has no opportunity to grow, it has no opportunity to show to this world what it can really do. The sunlight, I am talking about here is the industry exposure that a student needs to make the best use of his potential and to show that he too can make this world a better place to live. 
Hence I fully support the better chance an International student gets with the new 24 month OPT extension. Thank you America and Thank you Department of Homeland Security for everything you did and everything you are going to do.
