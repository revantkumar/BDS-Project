American workers come FIRST! Stop importing foreign workers that take jobs from American workers. This is all about money; corporations want to improve their profits by reducing their payroll as foreign workers will work for less money. Congress needs to reduce costly government regulations on corporations that will enable these corporations to keep American workers. Senators and congressmen who work against the American people WILL be removed from office by the American people. This includes both elephants and donkeys. 

We the people DO know what each of you is doing. Most of you have forgotten that this is a Nation of the people, by the people and for the people. You work for the people and you need to start listening to the people.
