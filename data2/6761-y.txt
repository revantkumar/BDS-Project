swaminathan mathiyalagan I strongly support the proposed 24 month opt stem extension. We are highly skilled and competent individuals surpassed all eligible criteria required to obtain job in US. Most of us have strong outstanding academic background and motivated to work, therefore the notion of replacing American workers with cheap foreign labor is false. The STEM students benefit the US economy significantly, we pay hefty tuition to fee to American universities, apart from that we spend locally on day to day expenses such as Housing, car, shopping etc. It also encourages the tourist revenue as we invite family and friends to visit us during graduation ceremony or as tourists simply. By not encouraging the STEM opt extension, chances of acquiring job becomes more difficult and thereby discourages foreign students. We fill only the gaps of highly skill workers, which is a minuscule amount as compared to total jobs available. 
In order to make this system fairer, please look out for people who violate the rule by applying multiple H1B visa. Also huge IT firms take major chunk of the jobs while highly skilled workers in other engineering fields are squeezed out. Please be reminded that apart from computer or Information Technology jobs there are many core engineering jobs that demand well equipped engineers where there are not much domestic workers available. I am in the midst of my OPT, it would derail the career plan for many skilled workers like me who have made a life decision to come here with dreams and aspirations if this rule is not implemented. We have too much at stake, give us a fair chance. We cannot be blamed if somehow our competency scares the domestic workers. Not to mention the US economy would lose millions of dollars, skilled engineers and technicians who contributes to frontier of science and technology.
