Nicholas Liew I strongly support this proposal. Actually, the international students from STEM can really help better development of the US. For one hand, diversity matters a lot, since different people can contribute their own expertise. For another hand, STEM is essential to the development of US, however, so many citizens do not have interest in STEM. Therefore, international students from STEM can fulfill the demand of STEM industries. To sum up, this proposal is very important to the development of US.
