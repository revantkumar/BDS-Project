It is ridiculous that the president and congress are willing to bring in so many foreign nationals to replace qualified Americans in the job market.
It is time for the American public to take notice of this and replace the congress and all elected officials that threaten the welfare of the people that elected and support them.
Find a way help all the Vets and other citizens that are willing to work. Stop jeopardizing the future of our graduating men and women and provide resources to help them get a better job.
Implement a policy and enforce it that insists US citizens first.
