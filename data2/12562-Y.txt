I believe this OPT extension will bebeneficial for attracting international STEM students and in the long run forthe economy of this country. Making the economy better is not about how todivide the cake. It is about how to make the cake larger. Tech industriesrelated to STEM programs are at the front of technical innovation and economicgrowth. We always need more creative minds here. Diversity begets creativity.Extending training opportunities for these STEM students not only gives themmore time to practice what they learned, it also increases the possibility forthem to stay in and make contributions to the tech industry of this country.Together with U.S. workers, I believe these people will create more jobopportunities and make the economy better.
