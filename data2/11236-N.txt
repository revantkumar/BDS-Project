Why are we expanding programs for foreign STEM workers when so many American STEM workers are unemployed? The statistics show Americans being passed over in favor of cheaper imported labor at very high levels. In addition,the stated intention of the program is at odds with the results : The workers are supposed to return to their home country and help improve things there, instead they use the program as an entry visa for American citizenship. All at the cost of $4 billion removed from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds- monies not intended for this purpose. The program is rife with fraud and abuse. It is shameful to continue it at all, even more so when American workers and taxpayers are suffering.
