Melissa Anderson Stop rewarding foreign citizens and start hiring Americans who were born in this country. Why would any country hire non citiZens over citizens native to the country. As US citizens we are expected to pay taxes, have healthcare and pay for it and now we can't get jobs because they are being handed to non citizens. Stop this insanity and for once, reward a law abiding tax paying us citizen with a job instead of non citizens.
