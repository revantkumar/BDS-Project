I strongly support to this activity. The main point of this strategy is to help America retain these talents. I think this activity does not only have benefit for companies in USA, but also for this country.
In my opinion, I think the reason that America is one of the strongest countries in the world is that it can attract excellent talents come here and create value for this country. This activity can add the opportunity for excellent student to stay here.This can make America stronger.
In addition, I don't think that American should worry about the employment rate. Owners are not foolish. They will hire these international people that very excellent. If you are excellent,you don't worry about your job. If you are just so-so, there does not have the same level international people that will compete with you.
