I would love this new rule to go through and be implemented.
This would benefit huge amount of skilled students who have studied here in the US and want to work here and contribute to the US economy. The present period of opt(12 months) would not be enough as there are huge number of job applicants and its hard to work long enough to get enough practical training. Regarding h1- lottery ,students would have at least 2 chances for their application to get picked. Considering the number of applications every year ; if this does not get implemented thousands of students are forced to go back to their country.
