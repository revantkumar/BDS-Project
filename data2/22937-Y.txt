This country was built by immigrants, and benefited from top talented minds from all over the world. Depriving foreign STEM students of legal rights to work does not mean companies will more likely to hire poorly educated and trained workers; those job opportunities will then just move overseas more quickly. 

Plus, those STEM students are NOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. This anti-foreigner movement is damaging the core competency of this great country. 

Please do the right thing, let this proposal pass and allow this country to keep growing with everyone's hard work.
