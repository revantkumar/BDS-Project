I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program as it will be detrimental to the U.S. Citizen. We should ensure our Citizens have first priority for enrollment into school classes, especially higher level of learning, and first priority into the U.S. job force. Our government should be protecting the welfare of the U.S. Citizen, including the ability to feed, cloth, and shelter our own families first.
