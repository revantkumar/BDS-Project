Students with STEM degrees are usually down-to-earth workers and create concrete values for the society with their highly trained skills. They are intangible wealth and motivation for the community if accommodated and placed at the right place to contribute to the society. Just think about how long it takes to train a stem degree student, more than 16 years usually. And it is an incredible investment which US doesn't have to pay for if it comes up with some ways to let them stay. And STEM extension will be a great way to accomplish this and discriminate them from those students with non-stem degree students. And I don't think that the stem degree students are competing against normal American citizens for working opportunities, because the demand for highly trained workers is still very high and will become even higher in the future especially those from math and computer science students. So I would consider it really worth it to keep and improve the stem extension policy so that more scientists and engineers can stay in America, contribute to the whole wealth of the society and altogether bring future to the human beings.
