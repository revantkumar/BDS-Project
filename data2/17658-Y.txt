First of all, I support the 24 months extension.
In my own observation, lots of U.S. students don't take graduate school after their undergraduate study due to many reasons. One of the reasons is the high tuition fee. 
On the other hand, companies are hiring people with special skills, even research background.
If U.S. government does not give more support to your own students to study at graduate schools, it's better to give foreign students a chance to contribute to your country. It's a win-win solution to get more smart people work in U.S. and help the economy.
