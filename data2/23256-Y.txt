I strongly support this rule. The F-1 students in STEM Degrees are young and smart people. Those students are always on top level in their own country and are most creative in their field. They already made significant contribution to the science and technology development in US, further help US to stay in the leading role in the world. Future of this world is in the hands of young students. We have to create the opportunities for them to work here so that they can implement more innovative things and Ideas.

Nowadays, the competition of technology in the world is fierce. Many other countries are eager to attracting those talented people like those well-educated STEM students. It is irrational to let those young people go. The leave of those well-educated young people will definitely hurt the future of US in a irreversible way.
