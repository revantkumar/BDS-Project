I AM AGAINST ANY PROGRAM THAT PROMOTES AND GIVES FOREIGH STUDENTS ADVANTAGES OVER THOSE OF UNITED STATES CITIZENS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE UNAMERICAN AND FURTHER UNDERMINE OUR COUNTRY TO THE BENEFIT OF BIG BUSINESS. WHY ARE WE UNDERMINING OUR OWN STUDENTS? WHY ARE WE THROWING ROADBLOCKS TO THEIR FUTURE? ISN'T IT THE GOVERNMENTS RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK OUT FOR ITS CITIZENS FIRST?
