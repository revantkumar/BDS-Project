I strongly support the proposal.

Based on the country policy of quality, F-1 student should have better training opportunities here, especially, talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. 
As I'm a Chinese STEM student learning interaction design which is in need for China, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.
