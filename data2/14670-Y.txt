I strongly encourage the expansion of OPT with STEM degrees. This action would effectively improve the probability that retain the talented STEM degree student to work in USA, especially student that holds undergraduate degrees. Due to the very limited Cap-Gap for H1B lottery regulation, talented undergraduates did not have enough chance to be selected by the lottery and thus had to return to their home country. To extend the STEM period would help those student to contribute the US company better and get better chance to retain those very standout student (since those not as mush standout student could not get employed for three years at the first place). So, DHS and USCIS should expand the STEM period to 24 months.

In addition, the cap-gap relief is necessary, too. Beside the similar reason of the STEM extension, the cap-gap relief increased the probability to retain the student with advanced degrees. Furthermore, increase the cap-gap also help to achieve the initial goal of extend the STEM period. As the STEM period has been extended, more and more students are going to be in the selection pool. therefore, is the cap-gap has not increased, there is still very limited space to retain outstanding students in the long run. As a result, I also encourage the cap-gap relief in addition to extend the STEM period.
