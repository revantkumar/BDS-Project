Ravindra G Hello,

I am a Masters student from an asian country and I believe that good educational standards, infratsructure are necessary for better future of both myself and the society. United States of America has the best educational practices and that is what attracted me to come here to pursue my masters. Being born in a relatively poor country we end up paying hefty sum for fees in our currency. Incase I go back to my home country my life time would not be enough to pay back the loans. OPT has been helping us over the years to work for sometime before leaving the country, and this enables us to pay back the debts we have. 

Retaining OPT will encourage more students in future and it is win win for both students coming here and USA. There fore I urge to reinstate the OPT program.
