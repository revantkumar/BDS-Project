Suresh M Thanks to ICEB for working on this new rule to protect international students when the previous rule was vacated by the court. I like the new rule as students get more time in training time or for getting any other non immigrant visa. I also like the wage monitoring it will ensure international students get a fair wage. Thanks for doing this.
