Jiumeng Liu I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal, with reasons listed below:

1. The American society gets benefits from the OPT program a lot, especially regarding to the proceedings of science and technology. Not a lot of American students are fans of scientific research. From my personal experience, above 50% of the science/engineering graduate students are from abroad. Many high-level research institutes as well as high-tech companies rely on the contributions from foreign STEM students. If the OPT program is somehow terminated, it will be a disaster. 

2. I am personally an atmospheric scientist. From what I've observed in the science division, most projects need two or more years to complete. It also takes some time for the students to start up; basically 3-6 months, to get familiar with the environment and facilities, etc. If the OPT extension time is too short, STEM students working on those projects would not be able to finish the work, and finding new people then having them continue the work is a low-efficiency manner. Considering the typical time required for science projects, 12-month regular OPT plus 24-month extension is a good length for the OPT program.

I hope those considerations would help, and also hope more people could support this proposal!

best,
Jiumeng
