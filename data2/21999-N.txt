I am opposed to the Department of Homeland Security's proposal to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT). This program gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.

John Miano, attorney representing tech workers, comments on the expansion:
the proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination."
"The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit."

Please do not expand the OPT program in ways that discriminate against American workers.
