I SUPPORT the opt-extension.
First I think if many foreign tech workers go back to their own country, their country will develop more quickly than before, which may affect USA's development.
Secondly,foreign tech workers contributed tremendous growth to the USA economy. Why USA becomes the best country all over the world? I think because during the second world war, many foreign tech workers moved to USA, some of them are scientists, some of them are workers. Those people did contribute tremendous growth to the USA economy. If USA doesn't afford opt-extension any more, I think USA is doing "seclusion seclude a nation from the outside world".In fact, although USA is still the strongest country, now the center of science is moving to Europe. So,opt-extension is really important to help those skillful workers stay in USA, or maybe we will see that other country becomes the strongest country in 30 years.
