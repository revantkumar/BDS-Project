I am international student, major in Electrical Engineering. I do think the OPT Extension is important. The OPT is a part of education, without practical experience we can not understand what we learn in campus, it's education waste. However, 12 months is not enough, normally we need about 2 or 3 months to find a job, and only less than 10 months to work, at same time, finding job will be harder without this extension. 

I think in this developed country with highly technology, economics and culture, cancel the extension is unreasonable. International students are also a part of United States, and we should have fair opportunity to study, work and value ourselves. We should build a easy environment instead of adding more limitations. 

Thanks.
