While I support this rule what about having a condition in place ? Giving 24 months to all should not be a solution as that impacts American STEM workers. Why not make it Credit based ? For example keep the default as 12 months as it was...but give it 24 months to ONLY those who can maintain CGPA scores and earn proper college credits. That will ensure that they are seriously learning what they are taught and are worth this opportunity.
So what I am saying is make this score-based..do not allow all to have 24 months of OPT.
