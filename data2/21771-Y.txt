I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons
1. This proposal can help enhance the economic growth of this country. People with high education and international perspectives can make a contribution to development of the industries. Also, those people not only work here, but also live here, so they will creates demands, which can create job opportunity locally. Moreover, they have family members and friends abroad. If those people come to visit them, then the tourism industry will be benefited.
2. This can help the high education in this country. With this regulation, it will be more attractive of the high education here. Not only will it help universities here raise money to maintain its high quality, but also it will continue making contribution to the prosperity of the high technology here.
