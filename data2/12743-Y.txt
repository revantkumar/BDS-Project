Thank you for this rule and extending the time frame to 24 months from 17 months. This will give students and employers multiple attempts at H1b and if not, sufficient time to try other NIV options or green card. I have a PhD degree in Physics from one of the top 20 schools in US and I work for an American firm with more than 10,000 employees. Currently I am responsible for a project that brings in more than 15 million dollars per year. I was not selected in the H1B lottery twice. Thanks to the 17 month OPT extension rule, I was able to continue with my job. In the absence of this rule, my group would have failed to keep the international contracts resulting in business loss to the company.

I believe most of the commentators here have confused H1B workers with STEM qualified individuals. First of all, this rule only gives a work authorization. Not a job. To get a job, F1 students compete fair and square. Secondly, an American citizen is ALWAYS given preference. A vast majority of jobs will only hire American citizens in the STEM field and are not open to F1 students at all. If a company is bypassing these laws and trading American workforce over cheap labor, especially in the IT job market, the company should be penalized, not the student. The students did not break any law. Many students graduating from top universities from their respective countries choose American Universities over European Universities just because of the OPT program. If this rule is not passed, it will be a grave injustice to those who had chosen American universities over other international universities.

Finally, the unemployment rate is at an all time low at 5%. If STEM students were indeed taking away jobs, could the unemployment rate be at an all time low?
