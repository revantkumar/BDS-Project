This is another attack on US citizens by this globalist-puppet rogue congress. It's time for us to impeach them all and start all over again. They are traitors to the American public, and to the Constitution as a whole. As the Declaration of Independence states, "But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."
