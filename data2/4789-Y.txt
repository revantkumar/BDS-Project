The OPT and its extension programs are the most effective policy in this country to bring in highly skilled and intellectual young minds into the workforce, and to have them contribute to the socioeconomic well being of this country. I fully SUPPORT the 24month extension and please keep brining in well educated, highly motivated people who will offer this country a better future!
