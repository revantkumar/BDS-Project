Yunlin Zhang These regulations profit the US government in the following ways.
To begin with, United States is the most powerful and advanced country in the world. With good education sources and safety situation, more and more foreign students are attracted to the United States to pursue higher degree. The increment of foreign students is an increasing force to support US economy. Their needs, including diet, housing, entertainment and travelling, prosper local economy and help provide more working opportunities in local area. According to NAFSA, "974,926 international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $30.5 billion and supported more than 373,000 jobs to the U.S. economy during the 2014-2015 academic year."[1]
These International students, especially students majoring in STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), are great supplement to STEM-related jobs. According to US Department of Education, there is increasing demand of STEM personnels in current decade. "The United States have been a great country and global leader through the hard work of its scientists, engineers and innovators."[2] High quality foreign students play an important role in keeping the competitivity of United States in a fast growing globe environment. These International students will help bring high quality manpower in STEM-related jobs and reduce the gap between high demand and manpower shortage in such positions.
These students, in the end of their extension, will return to their own countries because US will not support their immigration request as students. Therefore, there should not be any concern about increasing unemployment in US by passing these regulations. On the other hand, if these regulations are cancelled, thousands of employees will be forced to leave their positions. This will cause a catastrophe among all the STEM-related companies including car industries, software companies, medical engineering companies. 
I hope more and more people could actually see the benefits of these regulations and what they could bring to the United States.
