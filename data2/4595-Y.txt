I have to say that I am for the OPT extension.

First Opt DOES NOT STEAL the job opportunities but bring more opportunities and development to the whole country. OPT holders have to choose the job highly related to the major otherwise they are illegal to work for the not related jobs. OPT holders cannot go for the job whatever they want but have constrains. Also, for opt student, the employer have to select from the candidates from citizens or OPT holders. It means they have to pay the wages to OPT holders not less than the wages of the citizens. There is no reason for them to select the OPT holders for the inexpensive labor cost. As a rational employer, they will give the offer who can provide better value and contribute to the development of the company and OPT STEM students are more proficient in the science area, contributing to the breakthrough in the market. Finally, the whole society will gain the profits.

Moreover, OPT holders are well trained by the United States's Resources. The country allocate the resource to cultivate the students. Americans want to these students leave without contribute to US? This is irrational. Remember, there might be no Instagram if Mike Krieger, the founder of it was asked to leave because of this issue.
