Lokendra Nadh Jasti I would like to thank DHS for proposing the new rule to support STEM program. From my personal experience this extended 
STEM OPT will encourage small engineering companies to hire talented foreign graduates.

While I was in my last semester during school, I applied to many companies for an entry level position. I received about 8 phone 
calls from different companies, First question from them was " What will be your work status Green card or OPT?". They were
not interested in me in spite of my impressive resume because I will have only 12 months of work status and its difficult to get 
H-1 in lottery, so they don't want to waste time re-hiring some one to fill the same position. This extended 2 year STEM OPT will give
students enough chances to get H-1 in lottery and small companies will also be interested in talented foreign STEM graduates.

And also I would like to advice DHS to take measures to prevent some consultancy's which are misusing H-1 lottery by submitting
multiple applications for a single candidate with fake client letters. These consultancy's attract the foreign graduates by promising 
some jobs in software field, the prepare resume with fake experience and market with that fake resume and finds a senior level
job for a less or nil experienced graduates. This really affects the talented individuals. Please take strict measures to stop this fraud.
