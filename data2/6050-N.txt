I am a Veteran, and I didn't serve my country to see it "legally" or illegally invaded. This has got to stop. Too many decent American citizens are unemployed, or underemployed, because of illegals; to add legally sanctioned workers to take our jobs is not only despicable, it shows utter contempt for those you are elected to serve and put first.
