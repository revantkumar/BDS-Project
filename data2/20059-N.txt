I vehemently oppose the DHS's proposed rule that expands Optional Practical Training Program which hire foreign students for 3 years and avoid payroll taxes. This rule gives companies a financial incentive to hire foreign students at the expense of giving these jobs to Americans. JOBS FOR AMERICANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not foreign students - stop putting foreigners ahead of Americans. Companies will almost always take the cheaper alternative - foreigners - to Americans if you let them DON'T LET THEM!!!!!! STOP THIS RULE!!!!!!
