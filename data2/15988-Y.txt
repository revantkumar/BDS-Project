I strongly support the extension!!!!!!

Why should we send those talented people out of US if they are qualified and make contribution to the country? I hate those people who crying for jobs like babies.
For those jobless people,you should find your own reason instead of blaming others. 

My coworker, Adam Li, graduated from University of Texas at Dallas and joined our company since last year.
He helped a lot on the current project related to machine learning,millions of Americans benefit from the improvement of the endurance software.Based on that,we planned several 
head counts this year and would like to hire several college new graduates.

However, Adam has to stop working if he can't win H1-b lottery next year.
It is a huge loss for our department.A disaster!

Please help post-OPT workers like him to get a chance to work with us.OUr company need talented people!!!!
