Max Qian STEM graduates are definitely a group of people who will benefit US market and its global leading position.

DO those STEM foreign students abuse the OPT program and bring threats to Americans on job opportunity? The answer is definitely NO! After a deep searching, a group of data below will show how small the amount of STEM students are. 
The total number of international students enrolled in U.S. higher education expanded by eight percent to 886,052 students in 2013/14. The rate of increase has risen steadily for the past four years. Despite the increases in recent years, international students only constitute approximately four percent of the more than 21 million students enrolled in U.S. higher education.

Among those 0.8 million students, how many of them enroll OPT program. The answer is around 0.11 million foreign students. Consider 10 % expansion rate from 0.1 to 0.11 million from 2012/13 to 2013/14. 
[Quoted from one recent article from West Student Advisor "http://www.wesstudentadvisor.org/2015/01/international-stem-students-will.html"] 
Based on a simple comparison, we notice that the eligible foreign STEM students are less than 0.11 million in 2013/14!!! 0.11 million foreign STEM students vs. 21 million students, please give me some suggestion how could such a small amount of student create a huge threat to US job market.

Foreign STEM students are such an important component in US society that they bring more jobs for US citizens and bring up the increase of US annual GDP. 
Every foreign-born graduate with an advanced STEM degree is associated with, on average, 2.6 jobs for American workers. By some estimates, immigration was responsible for one-third of the growth in patenting in past decades, and these innovations contributed to increasing U.S. GDP by 2.4 percent. [Quoted from the WhiteHouse "The Urgency of Immigration Reform: Attracting the World's Best and Brightest" "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/06/16/urgency-immigration-reform-attracting-world-s-best-and-brightest"]

Suppose if you are a foreign STEM student and are concerning your legal status day by day, how can you completely devote yourself on jobs, US economy, and new innovations? [Quoted from the Hill "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/education/232021-immigration-reform-for-foreign-stem-graduate-students"] 

Last but not the least, Obama said "Are we a nation that educates the world's best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here, create businesses here, create industries right here in America?" This is a difficult question to answer properly, but the truth is that United States has to change and tries their best to keep talent foreign STEM students to stay. Because every country is now eager to attract their own citizens back to homeland. For example, the biggest competitor, China has a Thousand Talents Program for young and smart scholars. They attract hundreds of abroad Chinese major in science and engineering go back to China every year. A lot of world class companies choose to build industries in Asia because of cheap labor and try to recruit specialized graduates from US to work for them in other countries. Now world is changing, and US must keep steps on it.
