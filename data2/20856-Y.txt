Do you know who help United State recover so quickly from 2008. The abroad students in here helps a lot! They paid international tuition and fees usually three times than local residents. Also over half of such students are rich, their consumption created a big promotion of US economy. If there are not such OPT policy to support international students. US won't attract them any more! I hope US citizens need to think about such trade off. In addition, Most candidates who finally stayed in United State are top level employee. Do you want to sent them back to compete with your country after learnt most advanced knowledge from your colleges? There are a lot of Phds, Masters, the university's scientific breakthrough, the companies's development, need such top people stay in here.
