Amy Brown I support this rule. Many companies require those international students working for them. One year is exactly too short for those students to stay after graduation. If most of the new international staff have to leave after less than one year, how could these big companies develop?

America is a country with the most advanced technologies and science because it attracts the most portion of excellent students and experts in the world to study and work there. If our country can not provide a better opportunity for them, there would be less and less people coming and working for us. 

On the other hand, these smart international students also help to improve national students. With more competition and communication, American students work with more efforts and become more creative and comprehensive than before. 

Don't be so mean to those international students, treat them better, they will build our country better as well.
