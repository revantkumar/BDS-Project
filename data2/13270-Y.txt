For our STEM major students, 12 months OPT is kind of too short.
Since we know that for most science area, it needs a long time study and then make the knowledge into practice. 12 month is just the time to learn and study the new technology of a new job position. the value of study will show after 12 month. if the OPT is too short, and after we learned something new, then we have to leave. it is useless for our student and also will be harm for the companies. So STEM extension is necessary for STEM students.
