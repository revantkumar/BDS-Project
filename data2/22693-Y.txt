I highly agree with for the OPT extension for international students:

1. The egalitarian is the spirit and convention of the United States, so it is rational and fair to give international students a chance for practicing what they learned in undergraduate, graduate school, even Phd.

2. There are many talented international students, especially in STEM majors, so giving them a chance is also beneficial for the economy of the US. These great students will bring more profits for the company they are working at as well as for the whole country.
