Government -

Why are you actively working against the American worker? Why are US citizens not your first and foremost concern when attempting to amend immigration/visa laws? We have record low workforce participation, essentially zero enforcement of our current immigration laws, and no workplace enforcement to ensure the integrity of the current workforce regarding legal working status. In times of stagnant wages and low job growth, the last thing our government should be doing is advocating for foreign workers to come here and compete with American citizens for work. It is mind-boggling that the government is even considering this. How about we make sure that every US citizen that wants a job has first crack when one is available and not bring in foreign nationals to undercut wages and displace American workers? It seems the current administration will move mountains to advocate for foreign workers and illegal immigrants, while blatantly turning its nose up to whom they should be protecting the interests of, US citizens and LEGAL immigrants. Anyone that has taken a simple economics course knows that if you want to increase wages, you don't expand the workforce. Uncontrolled illegal immigration and lack of workplace enforcement of immigration and employment laws have decimated the middle class over the last 20 years. Anyone with a basic understanding of supply and demand should be able to understand that. Unfortunately, it seems the current administration does not, which is frightening in itself. 

Please cease and desist any and all actions attempting to increase the numbers of foreign workers competing against US citizens for jobs. The government should be of the people, by the people, and for the people. Not against the people.
