To Whom It May Concern,

I'm fully support the proposing OPT extension rule. 

The Proposing OPT extension rule will benefit all the three parties:The USA economy, the USA employers and the student under OPT. 

In the past decades, one of the treasure USA get is the open attitude toward talented people from other countries, which helps the USA economy grow. Lots of biggest tech breakthrough enjoys the contribution of foreign talented people and in the Current USA, high-tech jobs are still lacking of suitable local candidates. In addition, now all tech industries varies from high-tech company to Hollywood industry benefit from the contribution of foreign people in STEM major. Even in academic society, there are tons of people become professors or senior researchers who was not U.S citizen, which contributes a lot to science breakthrough for USA.

Also, after more talented people has more time to work in USA, it also helps the local employers to interact with people from all of world daily and has pressure and ambition to gain more knowledge to work as a team in some certain high-tech area. Also, it also helps the globalization of the USA.

Also, it benefit the student under OPT and help them to gain more working experience in USA and do more contribute to USA. If the proposing rule fails, I doubt lots of talented students will give up the chance to go to USA or give up the idea to work in USA, which costs great loss.

All in all, the proposing opt extension rules for STEM major student is necessary and contributes a lot to USA economy. And also the rule shows the open policy towards foreign people since the foundation of the country.

Thus, I'm fully in support of the proposing rules: "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students".
