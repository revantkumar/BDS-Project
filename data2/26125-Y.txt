At the first glance, it seems that elongate the OPT may endanger the working opportunities for Americans. But the reality in just on the contrary. I support this proposal for the following reason. The people in the realm of STEM are trained to innovate, to solve problems, to consider the future of human and a promising society will never limit the number of people who is working on these issues. One more step further, most of the developments in today's society originate from the contribution of STEM people. More STEM people means more development and then, more working opportunities for all of the people in the US. Taking Apple as an example, if we have another company just like Apple, let's say Orange, and we will have the same amount of "Orange store" in the US. Think about it. How many new working opportunities will be created? That is the power of STEM.
