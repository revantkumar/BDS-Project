Prudhvi Raj I see that the new rule would really benefit the students and employers as well. Students get more practical experience if they can work for 24 months. After all USA has this good economy because of the people from STEM field who worked here and contributed in it's growth. Most of the technology fields are filled up with international students who fill up most of the jobs when there isn't enough Americans citizens to do it. So it's not like International students are taking up American jobs. For more information about the shortage of STEM workers, you can refer to below link.

I would strongly support this new rule proposed by DHS.
