Kexin Yu The proposal to extend F-1 Nonimmigrant Student with STEM Degrees optional practical training (OPT) time to 24 months will benefit the US economy. F-1 students with STEM degrees play important roles in hi-tech companies in the Silicon Valley, Seattle, Chicago, and etc. Those students continuously contributing to the US technology industry, make the US build the most advanced software, hardware, vehicles, airplanes, equipments, and help improving the US economy. Take Silicon Valley as an example, F-1 students with STEM degrees can be found in almost every technology-related start-up and large company. These students work in core pieces in the companies and make incredible contributions to the industry. It would cause a huge loss for the Silicon Valley and the US economy in whole, if F-1 students with STEM degrees stop working for the hi-tech industry. 

As the H-1b visa lottery became an obstacle for F-1 students with STEM degrees to stay in the US, we should come up new rules for them to continuous working in the US. With this OPT extension, those students can have more chance to get the H-1b visa, so they can stay in their current jobs and make more contributions. This will also protect and benefit those companies who employ F-1 students with STEM degrees. Moreover, this proposal will also encourage more foreign students to come to the US to study STEM majors, which will result in an income increasing for the colleges and universities. Also, as as the US government has put large amount of financial expenditure into the college education for foreign students, there is no reason to let those highly-educated students to leave the US. 

Based on the above reasons, I strongly support the proposal to extend OPT time to 24 months.
