I strongly support the extension. The experience of working is the most important thing which international students care about. If they will not be supported the chance working in US, the number of international students will be reduced a lot. Many students may not choose study in US at the beginning. In this case, it will cause a series of effect on the economy in US. Therefore, the extension of the policy is necessary.
