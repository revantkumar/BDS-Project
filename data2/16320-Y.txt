I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for two reasons: 

1. The F1 students in the US is overall a very well-educated and talent group. These people have great values for the US country's interest as regard to the development of science, economics and engineering, etc. 

Based on the statistic data in my department in Electrical Engineering in University of Nebraska, Lincoln, at least 70% PhD students are international who hold F1 visa. Most of them are very active in their research areas, and are doing excellent work in their job field. The government should make policies to encourage these talent people to stay in the country and make continuous progress here in US, other than let them go anywhere else. 

The competitive technology of US industry MUST reply on these international talents, and favorable policies MUST be made for them and for the US. 

2. One of the most attractive points of US education for engineering students is that they can have an opportunity to work here after their graduation since they can have OPT. Cutting down the OPT will greatly reduce the attractive of US schools for international students, who contribute so much for the department's finance income, and the multiculturalism as well.
