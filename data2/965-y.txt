Zukini Pushkar As a CRO located in MD, a small American firm requires some highly educated student in the market. 
However, most of the highly educated STEM oriented student are internationals, please consider a company like us. Because if the good employee always chose by huge firm like Amazon and Google, we have no chance to survive in the market. Let alone we keep cutting down the number of well educated students. 

Based on our experience, those who passed out selection systems are well performed and highly efficient employee which is relatively good enough for the position required.
