I am a international student from Northeastern University, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. I think the proposal embodies the American Dream, it gives us the opportunity to achieve success through hard work.
2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, lots of successful people were international students before they succeeded, and they made a great contribution for this country. 
3. As we know, America values the contributions of immigrants and non-immigrants when continue to enrich this country and preserve its legacy as a land of freedom and opportunity.
4. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.
