I strongly agree with this policy! International students are keeping the market competitive and energetic. It's very hard for an international student to find a job here in America, so as long as they get their jobs, they work really hard and treasure the opportunity. We Americans should learn from their energy. I'm more than happy to see more international students working for our local companies.
