I think it is an amazing opportunity for this country and as well as for international students. As far as the work visa is concerned and that foreign jobs take away american jobs, I have never seen it in the companies I have worked at. The Fortune 500 companies that I worked for never discriminated against anyone and had no intentions of hiring low wage workers. All they need is smart people to help growth of this country, the beautiful country of immigrants who can think freely and be successful.
