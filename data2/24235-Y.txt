I strongly support this proposal. STEM international students are those most talented one coming from different countryies all over the world. their number is actually not that big. Actually, it's already much harder for international STEM students to find a job than citizens in the US. So those who managed to finding a job are really talented ones who can make a big difference to the US. With OPT extension, these talented people are more likely to devote their best year working and making contribution for the US instead of their home countries. These people will help top high-tech companies in the US keep their leading positions in the world. the lose for both America and international STEM students are unmeasurable if OPT extension is canceled.
