Su Su I firmly support the proposed rule on STEM extension. The rule will allow international students with strong STEM knowledge to apply their skills to industry and research institutions in the US, which will be a substantial benefit to the US economy.

I am a research staff at Stanford, and am currently on my OPT based on a master's degree in Ed Tech. I am working on a 4-year project in this area funded by the IES (Institute of Education Sciences), and my boss expects me to work on this project for at least two years. If my employment terminates in less than a year, it'll be a huge loss to both of us in particular, regarding that he has already invested months training me. I am very happy to see the new proposed rule on STEM extension, because it'll allow me to keep my commitment to our research project.

Our project is aim to enhance US high school students' STEM learning by the way. US will gain an everlasting benefit if the project goes well, and all I need is three years of authorized working training here. DHS, thank you so much for this decision.
