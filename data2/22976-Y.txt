I can the most strongest support this police. 

To those who are again OPT extension US people: shame on you! 

I cannot understand there are few people do not want to see the happen of 24 months extension of OPT. Those US citizen cannot find a job is only because you're too LAZY. NOT other reason. If you can spend 1% time compared with the international graduate who successfully find a job in the US, you must have a very decent opportunity. International graduate, they're our friend, not enemy. They're helping us to make sure the leading role of the US in the word. They talent and contribution should not be ignored and underestimated. 

So I can the most strongest support this policy OPT extension, no doubt, no hesitate, no reservation.
