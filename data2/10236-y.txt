Alan Jin I strongly support this rule proposal.

Firstly, from what I observed. US companies don't prefer international students than US students. Instead, many job openings ask for US citizenship. So the truth is international students start finding jobs with inferior positions. Different from general immigrants policy, STEM OPT extension helps US to retain high-educated workforce from leaving this country right after graduation.

Secondly, most universities and the local economies rely heavily on being able to attract international students. These students come with strong consuming capabilities. Revocation of STEM extension will drastically undermine the number of potential students in the future, therefore cause heavy damage to US education industry and the local economies revolving around them.

Finally, almost all the technology giants hire a great amount of international students after their graduation. Some employees are still in their OPT and depending on an OPT extension for being able to continue working for these big companies. Imagine what will happen when these highly-skilled talents are forced to leave the country. A revocation of STEM policy will cause damage to US best technology companies beyond imagination, and states like California and Massachusetts will face huge problems. Furthermore, these workers will bring their skills and knowledge back to their original countries, many are competing with US now.

Because of the reasons above, I support this new proposal and hope it will get passed in time so no damage will be caused because of the potential gap.
