I strongly support this proposal.

First of all, most of the projects undergoing right now takes more than 2-3 years to finish in the STEM field. Specifically, I am a graduate student right now studying in the field of electrical engineering and most of the research groups within our department consists of a lot of international students. It will be really a waste of not only time but also money to have half of the group left at the middle of the projects.

Also, once the international students get enough time to compete in the society, it would really cause a beneficial competition and it is easier for the US to keep all the elites in the specific area. 

What is more, there is negative saying that some of the international students are not qualified to get the position or the job they have. But to get an OPT extension, according to the proposal, one has to have a qualification interview and that is exactly selecting the best to be hired in the US companies.

Finally, having the extension will also do benefits on the economics of the US. Not only do international students created more revenue to the car rental companies, restaurants, online shopping sites and local shopping malls, but also the visiting parents will bring benefits to the tourism of the US as well.
