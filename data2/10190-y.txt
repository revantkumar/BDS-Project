Chandra Tadikonda Virtually all the job requirements in the advanced technology area demand a minimum of 3 to 4 years of expertise. With that being the case, it is hard to find a well paid job that meets the requirement of a qualified H1 B worker within a span of one year from the completion of course. So, please take this into consideration in extending the training period to a minimum of 2+ years. The industry in turn can get a good opportunity to hire people that are already oriented to our walk of life with a pay scale that suites the experience level of the candidate. It can then minimize taking a chance with a H1 B hire from outside who often times may not be a good fit based on their foreign background.
