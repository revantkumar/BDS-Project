Melody Liu ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT. This is not only about the STEM students who benefit directly from the proposal. This is about every team, every company, and every industry IN the US who has a large demand of employees and talents from STEM. These teams, companies, and industries are the centers of innovation and creativity of United States. The current policy is obviously not enough to meet the demand considering the low chance of H1B lottery. This proposal is DEFINITELY the right decision.
