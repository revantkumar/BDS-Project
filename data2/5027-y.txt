Vamshi Krishna Dontheneni I am a F-1 student and on OPT status. OPT is really helping me to gain experience in field of study, which I may not earn if I go back to my country. STEM extension will be a good rule as student like me can get more chance to learn practical experience. International students will be attracted to American Universities if and only if they have chance to work at place where they learn. So students like me and firms that are hiring OPT students will be happy if this rule gets passed.
