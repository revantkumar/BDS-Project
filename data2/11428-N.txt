Recent American citizen STEM grads are learning that their ability to obtain a job after graduation is being severely and detrimentally affected by yet another government visa program that hires foreign citizens over them, by way of the OPT program. These citizen students have workers very hard and done everything right, as well as leveraged their futures for the chance to make a difference and utilize their superior skills in their chosen STEM careers. In most cases, the citizen STEM graduates have upwards of $100,000 student debt that will take years to pay back. Now, these employers cry that they can't find qualified American workers, really?? Now, the government comes up with this OPT scheme? To top it off, it is actually a cost benefit for these tech firms to hire foreign national by way of huge cost savings on payroll taxes? It is so disheartening and maddening. Please, do NOT approve this expansion of this OPT program. We have plenty of perfectly qualified American STEM workers, many thousands more with SUPERIOR skills than their foreign counterparts.
Do NOT allow the OPT expansion to move forward. NO.
