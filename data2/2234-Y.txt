I support the improving and expanding of OPT for F1 students with STEM. As an international student studying environmental health, I obtained my master's degree in the states and worked on a NIH funded research project for two years with OPT STEM after graduation. My effort was necessary for success of the research project and I was able to figure out my true interest in research/academia. Now I've started my PhD training and I am looking forward to making the world a better place with my knowledge and research. Since projects in my area normally last for 3-5 years, two-year involvement would be a minimum time for anyone to understand the area and make a contribution. I am grateful for the work experience that helped me find my career plan and I would like others to have the same chance.
