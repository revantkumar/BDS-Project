April Tsai I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international Electrical Engineering student The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation and the great multi-culture environment. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.
