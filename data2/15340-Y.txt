I Strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from US universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to US.

2. Diversity is very important for US, not only for academic, but also industry side.

3. Competition does exist, but it will positively contribute to US.
