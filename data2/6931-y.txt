Mohul Kaila Students come to United States for opportunities they haven't got in their home country. Be it educational or professional.

Not every student stays back after completion of the course. They return after they have acquired skill and experience.

United States is the best place to get skilled experience in latest trends in technologies. We should encourage this as it would also help the economy. It's a win-win situation. 

There are other countries offering same opportunities, it's the loss of US if this facility is not provided as the students will find elsewhere to go but we cannot fill the need for their services.

I strongly encourage the proposed law of expanding the training opportunities.
