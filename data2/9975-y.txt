Peng Gong OPT is the best policy for the development of US. I strongly agree and support this rule to be approved for the below reasons:

1. The most important competitive advantage of U.S. is the high technology and innovation which make this country mostly different from other country and put it always in the leader of this world. Technology is core power and core strength that America always be proud of and stand at the very frontier of the world.

2. The most important factor to have this power is the people and talent. The Stem student is this part of people. They are young and they are highly educated. They learned the most highest technology from the university in US. Those are the most important resources that American government should always absorb and stay them in the country. To help it always keep it in the high level of the technology.

3. The technology power will not make the job less, however, it will make the economy much better and create more job opportunity by creation and innovation. Think about internet era and think about the up coming big data revolution. If U.S. still want to be the leader of the world, if US will not want to be a follower of Canada, Australia, Europe and even Japan,because the cancellation of this policy will directly more talented student choose to go there rather than America for their study and make contribution there and actually one of my classmate is thinking about that, expanding of the OPT and stay this part of talented people is the most efficient, most convenient, and most economic way to do it.
