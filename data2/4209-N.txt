I oppose the DHS and Obama's position on H1 visas and importing more alien workers to come take more American jobs. For an administration that is adament about making sure it gets every taxpayer dollar, they sure are lax when it comes to letting big corporations pay less taxes by employing aliens. Harry Reid blocked the Sanctuary cities bill protecting Americans who are being murdered by illegals because "we'd have to buy 20,000 more prisoner beds." Huh? 
Well, that money could come from the money you're letting corporations keep by hiring alien workers instead of our own Americans out of jobs. I know where this administration's priorities are. Keep Americans out of work and bring in more alien workers. But Americans don't have their heads in the clouds anymore. Hard-working Americans need jobs. Obama prances around pretending like he's supportive of the Trade agreement because it'll bring more jobs back to our country and outsource less. This is in direct conflict with H1 visas and doesn't make any sense. It's hypocritical and needs to be stopped. Americans are unemployed. The highest rate of unemployment in decades but Obama seems to think everything is just fine all the while with a big smile on his face. 
We need to control how many people come to this country. Not because we don't want diversity, but Americans and their jobs need to come first. With how our Congress and this administration have proceeded with senseless policies, I'm doubtful that all these comments will make a difference. But until 2017, all we can do is hope that enough representatives care enough to stand up for the hundreds of thousands of hard-working tax-paying citizens that are out of work.
