James Wills It's really sad to view some of the comments here. Some people are so short-sighted that they care more about their short-term salary than the prosperity of this country. The only way to ensure that we all have jobs is to make sure that our companies have the strength to compete with foreign companies. STEM OPT is a great support to our industry. Probably we will get a slightly higher salaries if we kick all foreigner out of this country, but in the long run, it is killing our companies! Then at that time, we will all be jobless and watch the fall of this great country helplessly. That's why I strongly support STEM OPT program. It provides fresh blood to our industry, and it keep our country strong and healthy!
