Clark Peng As a country that relies on innovation and attempts to attract international talents to shape the high-growth industries, USA has been carrying this core value for years. It would be a great discouragement if the OPT program can only be 12 months long, in which case most international students would find extremely difficult to continue their growth and contribution in this country. As competition warms up in STEM related fields, from a continuous growth point of view, it is more suitable to extend OPT program for international students at least for two good reasons: 1st, it is fair for international students who invest lots of money and time in their higher education to get opportunity to practice their career skills. 2nd, it would encourage the most talented students to stay in this country provided enough OPT time to win H1B lottery.
