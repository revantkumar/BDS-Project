As a current employee working at a high-tech company, I strongly support the OPT extension proposal for following reasons:

1. It's a GREAT benefit for American economy. As we know, high-tech recruiting market is incredibly competitive. The high-tech companies already paid a lot of money and time to have a qualified employees. If letting them lay off just because of a political reason, it's a huge hurt on those employers such as Google and Apple, which will finally have negative impact on American economy. 

2. It's a GREAT benefit for USA keeping leading position of technology. Most of those OPT students are brilliant and had very good education in those world-renowned universities. Without OPT extension, some of them will just go back and serve their home countries, which are basically competitors of America. Thus, why people coming from American education system don't deserve a chance to make contribution to USA, just because of they lack of OPT extension?

3. It's not harmful to American citizen's working opportunity! High-tech recruiting market is completely open and equal for anybody. The only reason why foreign students get a job is not they receive lower pays or some other absurd reason, just because they are QUALIFIED. Actually, companies will prefer citizen because they don't need to sponsor their working visa and green card, which are extra cost for them. However, there is just not enough citizen to recruit for this high-tech industry.

All in all, USA, as a country of freedom and a land of opportunity, should not reject those foreign students who will contribute their own knowledge and make America stronger.
