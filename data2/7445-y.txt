Isha Joshi I strongly support the extension of OPT period to 24 months. International students not only bring technical expertise but also provide an opportunity to learn about different cultures.
strong business personalities like Indra Nooyi (CEO Pepsico) and Satya Nadella (CEO Microsoft) are also internationals achieving greater goals for companies in USA.
International students are equally competent as native students and would appreciate an equal opportunity at success and career growth.
