I am an international student and have graduated from art academy in 2013. I Believe the government should let the students who learned professional knowledge and skills from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. We spent couple years to achieve a degree, because we wanna do something for this country and improve the industry better and better. 24 months means student have more chance to find a job and work in this country. Please let student have right to work in U.S.
