I strongly support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. Having a diverse workplace is extremely important also for fostering US jobs + workplace environment.

I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S.
