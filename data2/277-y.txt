Fen QING I strongly support the new proposed OPT extension rules for F-1 students with STEM degrees.

First of all, OPT extension is directly related to US educational institutions. It is fundamentally a selling point of the US educational market, and a lot of students come to the US rather than Europe or other countries due to this benefit. It would be a huge threat to the US educational financially institutions without this extension.

Secondly, I am strongly convinced that allowing F-1 students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their field. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Rejecting international students would gain the US a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students.

American people are wise enough not to harm your long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people!
