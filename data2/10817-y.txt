Larry Holley It is way past time for the government of the people to start doing what is best for those people!We must put our people to work and not try to worry about employment needs of other countries. If we don't put our own folks back to work we won't be able to help people in our country that need help. What do you think will happen here when the working class can no longer pay the way for people who are too lazy to get a job? 

We must put a stop to importing workers from other countries. It just doesn't make any sense.

Thank you.
