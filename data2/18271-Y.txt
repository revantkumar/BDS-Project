This is a very good initiative to attract more qualified and talented students from all over the world to US. Some people may think it will be detrimental to US job market or US workers, but it turns out not to be the truth given a second thought. If we make a calculation of the GDP and the new job opportunities created by these F1 OPT workers, we will find the number astonishingly higher than that "occupied" by foreign students. The overall result is undoubtedly beneficial for US and its people. Last but not least, we all know US is a great country established by various immigrants. You can hardly find a person with no treasured family members or friends from an immigrant background and you know how great these people are. Then why not keep attracting these great and gifted people to help make the United States more diverse and prosperous? The past prosperity of US was built upon its diversity and this will always be held just because it is too good.
