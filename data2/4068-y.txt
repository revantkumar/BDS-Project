Estelle Tao I strongly believe this OPT extension rule will benefit both international students and this country. International students who study in US for years should be allowed to legally work here after they graduate, not only for them to practicing their skills and also let them contribute the society with their knowledge. 

I saw lots of negative comments have a huge misunderstanding of this OPT extension, foreign students may increase the competition for job searching, but in a good way and it's not the reason causing citizens unemployed. OPT extension rule requires international students work for E-varify companies in order to keep the OPT. Those E-varify companies always consider citizens first when they have a job opening, because hire an international student is way more complicated than hire a citizen with same skill set and capability, also they may lost their international employees due to the H1B lottery based system and this is a risk they want avoid. So international students come in only because there are a shortage of qualified candidates among citizens.

In the long term benefits, international students will increase the jobs not decrease. Good competition help tech companies gathering more talented candidates, industries will grow and thriving with these talents and only a prosperity economy would create more jobs. Also the evidence shows many foreign students like start new business; between 2006 to 2012 one quarter of start up engineering and technology companies have an foreign student as one of the key founders, these new companies provide more jobs to the pool. Drive away these talented foreign students may let the job market less competitive in a short-term, but a close door market will loss potential opportunities and benefits for sure and hard to continue grow in the future, a far-sighted individual should be able to understand this.
