I strongly support this policy.
The most important thing is international students with F-1 visa could not affect people with permanent working right. No companies would hire a F-1 students if they have other choice. Because hiring a F-1 nonimmigrant student cost more. Companies have to apply H-1B visa for employee with F-1 visa which would cost a lot of money and time. Otherwise these employee could not work for a long time. So students with F-1 visa could only get the job position when no other people with permanent working right is available.
So it would be helpful for human resource market to expand training opportunities for F-1 students. Because they could fill the blank area in the human resource market and provide companies a last choice to hire their desired employee. 
In sum, expanding training opportunities for F-1 students would not have a negative influence to current US citizen while it could be helpful for those companies which could not find an ideal candidate for a job position.
