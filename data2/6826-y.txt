Rishabh Singh I support this change completely. 
After completing graduation in STEM fields, students and US economy both will benefit from this proposed rule. This will give students enough time to practice their newly learned skills as it's not easy to get this much exposure in their respective home countries and in turn provides the tech companies with the required work force. In no way this will serve as means of cheap labor as all international students take equal pays as their American counterparts. 
Immigration reforms, if required should be imposed in the visa being given to non immigrants directly for work. Students who have done their studies from colleges in USA should always be encouraged to utilize their talents in helping the economy. 
This also gives enough time to pay off the loans that most of the students have taken. 
IT industry, being the fastest growing part of current economy, needs this additional workforce that this rule will provide.
This rule will also help in restricting the jobs from being outsourced, which will greatly harm the US economy. Companies always prefer a US worker over a non immigrant so this in no way will take away jobs from any of the American workers. Outsourcing of jobs does take away these jobs (cheap labor) and this rule will help in restricting that.
In the end, I see this rule as benefiting both students and the US economy. So I strongly welcome this proposed rule.
Thanks.
