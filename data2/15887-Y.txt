I'm working in a top tech company and I would feel awful if my international colleague can no longer work with us due to status issues. 

In fact, a fair portion of my colleagues are foreign. They can get tough problems to be solved and we work closely everyday on making better life for humans. I can't imagine what the company would be like if they can't work here anymore. They put all their heart into their job, and they offer their intelligence with no reserve, they bring so much joy and diverse to our culture. It's just so unfair if we say something so mean like that (the negative comments here). 

I felt that all the negative comments are just so ridiculous. I don't know where are those comments come from and I really wonder what these people do for a living. It's STEM!! I mean, all those foreign students are extremely intelligent and hardworking students, and what's the problem with that???? Why don't you try working hard and find a good job! If they can, why can't you!!!It's the lazy people here complaining about loosing their job! We really need some kind of natural select to get rid of these people. 

They are not Americans ? They will be!!!
