I strongly support OPT-Extension! As one of many STEM students who choose to come to USA to pursue higher education, this OPT-Extension program is one of biggest reason. If not for this program, I would not consider to choose to come here at all, the tuition and the living expense here is so high, and without such program that allows us to work here and gain working experience, USA graduate programs will become much less attractive to foreign students!
