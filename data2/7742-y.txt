Ming Chen Dear Officers,

I am very supportive of this rule. As an engineering student, I will definitely benefit from it. And I think it is an all-win policy that will benefits students, US people and industries. There are concerns that students with STEM degrees will take the jobs that should go to US citizens. This argument can only be true when they are more job candidates than the number of jobs. As far as I know, US does not lack STEM-related jobs, but quite to the contrary, the suitable candidates to STEP-related jobs are lacked in US. So, I do not agree with the concerns of lost US jobs.

I will appreciate it very much if this rule is passed. Thank you very much for listening!

Sincerely,
Ming Chen
