I strongly agree that the OPT 24-month extension should be implemented. 

International student in STEM fields have made a great contribution to the continuous development of U.S. economy and technology. This group of students can greatly facilitate the U.S. development. American higher education has invested a lot in educating international STEM students. Remaining them to work in the U.S. for several years after graduation will certainly reward the American society. Only keeping these students to work for the U.S. can maintain U.S. competitive position in the world.

So STEM OPT extension is NECESSARY. It favors the American society.
