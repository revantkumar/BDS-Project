Chang Liu I graduated from Columbia University Engineering School. I'm currently working in a technology group in one of the largest hedge fund in NYC. I worked hard every day and build several automation program to help the company improving the efficiency. This will make a contribution to the tax my company paid every year and also make a contribution to the recovery of the U.S. economics. I enjoyed working in U.S. and I want to continue working here. This act will help me get more opportunities to get a working visa and continue my contribution. Please accept this. Thank you.
