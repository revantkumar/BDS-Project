I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.
It is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. Since I start finding jobs, the fact is really obvious that few applicants of STEM are citizens or green cards holders. Which leads to a lot positions vacant while companies are less willing to sponsor h1b. However, if the opt extends to have 24 months more, it definitely would be a big boost of US economics and development.
