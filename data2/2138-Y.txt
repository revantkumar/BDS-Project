I support Extending STEM OPT period. Because there is huge competition for h1-b lottery due to lower h1-bs and more applicants(nearly 8:1 ratio). Many f-1 students should go back if their h1-b is not picked. Because of this, the purpose of getting international work exposure will not be achieved though the f-1 student worked hard for 2/3 years during their masters. As a result of this, students will not show up for doing ms and there will be very back on prospective masters students. If STEM OPT period was extended, there will be at least chances for h1-b pickup instead of one chance. All F-1 students will be very grateful if STEM OPT period is extended and this will have very good impact on coming masters students from different countries.
