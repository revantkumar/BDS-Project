Wei Zhang I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. It is beneficial for US to retain well educated and skilled talent from all over the world. People holding an accredited higher education degree are the most valuable worker for the future prosperity of the country. We should not only let them stay but also improve the current immigration system to make it easier for them to stay.
It will not impact our job market. In fact the current number shows that our job market is at its best since the depression.
Retaining international talent will help to create more jobs not less jobs.
It will help to drive technology innovations that keeps us ahead of the others.

Thanks,
