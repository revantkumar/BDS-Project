Zhen Wang Strongly agreement.
A 24-month training opportunity would provide at least a 24-month free labor force to America. And no one know which student could become the next Bill Gates. America is the country born from the competition, and the competition is the energy of America's development. Because of the competition on each jobs, America could have such great development. 
Every country are trying to get the talent person from the work, and America is the largest birthplace of talent because of best universities. Expending opportunity for F1 student would take advantage of this advantages.
Most F1 student in stem speak a foreign language and be weak in writing beautiful words. But we know how to write a paper, how to develop the economic and science. Many people only know how to write beautiful word, but they are just like beautiful silk, they would not help you without the beauty. However the stem student are not beautiful and catchy, like sands, but they can contribute the base of the country.
