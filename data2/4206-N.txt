It's awful how this government and our corporations are not honest with us. For decades Americans have been replaced, fired, for cheap labor. Too jobs were outsourced and then companies flood the rest of the computer specialist jobs with H1Bs from India. Many different vocations and industries have had the same treatment. There are plenty of Americans that are qualified for these jobs but the companies want cheaper, almost slave-like, workers.
So as I see it, again you are lying about the need for foreigners to do American jobs. There is no need. Hire the Americans back that were fired. And then train more Americans for these jobs. We have a huge workforce that has been pushed down into menial jobs when they are highly educated and trained. We also have a huge workforce that is not working at all. This is simply unconscionable.
When will the government's lies stop?
This is a bad regulation. It is harmful and just plain anti-American.
I hope you tear it up.
