As we all know, USA is a immigrant country with less than 300 years' history. Though it does't have a long history, but it is the No.1 powerful country in the contemporary world. Why? Why USA can make it and lead the world. I think it is the immigrants that contribute to these achievements generation to generation. Maybe someone rejects this, and think the brilliant native American people promote the whole society to move ahead. However, maybe your ancestors came here by Mayflower in 1620.
