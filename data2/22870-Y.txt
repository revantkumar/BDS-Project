I totally support this rule because:
1, It allows more talented foreign students to stay in the United States, which in the long run benefits the U.S. society as a whole.
2, Foreign students have a good understanding of their home countries so their staying helps the US companies expand business globally as well as make foreign policy
3, If this rule is not passed, those talented students will study abroad in other countries that allow them to stay afterward and find a job there, helping their economy compete with the United States.
