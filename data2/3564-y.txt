Anonymous Anonymous This is the best rule ever. It's like free lunch to US. 
America spends almost nothing on these students. Because they are raised and educated in other countries spending other countries' taxpayers' money. They come to US for some STEM education by paying tuition themselves. And then they are ready to serve US by working in US companies. They not only bring in creative thought but also pay taxes to raise Americans. 
It's totally free lunch. So I'd say "America, take it!"
