Given that there are 90 million people without jobs in the US, given that the tech industry has spent a billion and a half dollars lobbying for the change in the H-1B Cap, and given that the request for the change in the H-1B Cap is so clearly an effort to circumvent legislation designed to protect jobs for Americans, this change should not be put into effect. If there are training programs for foreign students, there can be training programs for Americans to do this tech work. If there is such a "need" for tech workers, why can't an effort be made to fill this need with American workers, instead of changing regulations to fill the need with foreign workers who will work for lower wages. If foreign workers are willing to work for lower wages, thus increasing profit for tech companies, how will they support themselves on less than a "living-wage"? Will they be asking for entitlements, such as food stamps or housing assistance to meet their financial needs? Will the American taxpayer thus be subsidizing the tech industry by supplementing the low wages the tech industry hopes to pay foreign workers? I do not support this proposed change in the H-1B Cap that would allow foreign workers to be classified as "students" to work for more than 12 months. At worst, if this change is put in effect, they should not be classified as "students", who avoid paying taxes. They should pay taxes like any other else living and working in the US.
