It's apparent to me that NONE who are promoting this special treatment for non-American workers has tried to get an IT job in the US lately. Add in that you might be over 50 years of age and you can forget it. Twenty plus years of experience? Too bad. Need to keep working to pay your bills and have a hope of an actual retirement? Forget it.

Sponsored foreigners have taken the jobs and they're taking more each day. Half the IT recruiters who call me can barely speak understandable English.

I'd like to know why this administration is so busy spending time and money to expand opportunities for foreigners - when so many US citizens are under or unemployed. I'm pretty sure no government or employers in those foreign countries is doing the same for me.
