3) Your great president, Roosevelt, is immigrant. Please refer to the document: "His parents were sixth cousins[7] and both were from wealthy old New York families. They were of mostly English descent; Roosevelt's patrilineal great-grandfather, Jacobus Roosevelt III, was of Dutch ancestry, and his mother's maiden name, Delano, could be traced to a French Huguenot immigrant ancestor of the 17th century"

They are the long-term competitive source of the states, please refer to the Roosevelt/Regan's reform which introduce the act/policy to build the foundation and infrastructure, which lays the foundation of prosperity of the states today.
5) Short-term vision of not welcoming talents, is making the united states, to become the irrelevant and no longer leader in the world.
