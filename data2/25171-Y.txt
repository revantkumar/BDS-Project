I DO NOT think that this rule will make US citizens to lost their jobs or opportunities. First, High-tech companies will employ most of foreign students and they actually contribute to US economics and at same time US citizens will not lose their jobs in other industries. Even in high-tech industries, more international students may make more job opportunities for local residents. Second, the extension will absolutely attract more talents to come to America. Please do not forget that how foreign immigrants contributed to this country. Most of US citizens are immigrants or offspring of immigrants.

However, I understand why so many Americans cannot accept the rule. So I think the extension can only be applied to the students from top 50 or 100 universities in US. International students from these universities are top students from all over the world. Should we give them top education and let them go back their countries to compete with us? I do not think this is a good idea.
