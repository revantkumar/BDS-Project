Like I read in many comments.. It is not about killing america or stealing jobs. Every company prefers employing citizens compared to foreigners. It more economical for them to avoid sponsor any visas. Jobs are given based on merit. And anyone can get the jobs, It just about giving opportunities to people and this in turn helps building economy in USA. Technical sector is on a boom with talented individuals and this could be any of us..Need not necessarily be a foreigner or a US citizen. USA has been a platform to help individuals increase their talent and passion in STEM.. So I believe this rule only supports talent and economy of USA and not anything else. and hence strongly approve this
