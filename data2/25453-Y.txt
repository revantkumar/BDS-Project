This is a long-awaited improvement to the OPT program for tens of thousands F1 students, who already contribute substantial to the America society during their study through active research in STEM disciplines and are willing to continue their contribution by working in the US.

Every year many foreign students are forced to leave the US with their advanced knowledge gained from the post graduate education in US institutions, simply because they don't even get a chance to be considered for a work visa. The limited quota for H1B visa is in fact the core of this ever concerning phenomenon, which unfortunately could take years to fix due to the inherent complexity of immigration reform. The extended OPT program partially alleviate this problem by providing extended temporary work authorization to these students so that they could have slightly more chances of winning a work visa lottery. Although this is not a perfect solution, it is widely accepted as a relief for many foreign students.

It is true that many of the students benefit from the education opportunity in the US, but it is also worth noting that these young minds, with their expertise in domains covering almost all aspects of American economy, are one of the most important driving force of America's continued success in the competition of global leadership. It is only wise and fair if the America offers the chance for these brilliant young people to stay and seek for their American dream.
