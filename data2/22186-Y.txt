I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. As an international student from China, I had multiple options to pursue my master degree in DATA SCIENCE in US, British, Hong Kong, Singapore and also in mainland China. I chose to study here is that US government provides me the industry training opportunity during school and after graduation. I cannot believe that US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country. Many young ones like me would choose to study in other counties with better policy for foreign STEM talents. This new rule would ensure that the US academic sector could remain competitive globally.
Moreover, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it would be a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. They have high demand for diverse STEM talents.
