Nowadays, more and more international students are coming to USA to chase the dream here. OPT is one of the most important ways for international students to have opportunities to work in the US, and extension of OPT is also helpful for students to accumulate more experiences. I am an international student who came to USA 2013 fall, and my major is STEM, since I was hoping to use OPT to accumulate more experiences in the US, I would like to see that I could have chance to use the OPT extension after I graduate next year. 

Canceling the OPT extension is also showing a negative attitude for US government to the international students, especially most of the international students could help US universities and institutes to solve the financial problem, give up OPT extension will definitely hurt feelings of international students, so I don't think it is a good idea.
