Eddie Fisher I totally agree to extend the period for F-1 students. 

F-1 students generally work harder than our local people. Giving them a chance means our appreciations for their contributions. Why do we want to set up a rule for people who fears to compete with others. Our country is a country of equality. It sounds like a discrimination to me by earning those students tuitions and kicking them out of the country.
