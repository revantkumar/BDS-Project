Aman Sehgal I support comprehensive immigration reform in the favor stem graduates from you US universities. Not only are in them and students in the Stanfield extremely hard-working and diligent but also very entrepreneurial and lead to the creation of new companies and new patentable technologies that American companies benefit from. I think it is very important that stem graduate with a masters degree or higher from her US research university permanent residency so that they can pursue their research interests and courier double up man and further and enrich the US economy.
