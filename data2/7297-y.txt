Ethan Li I strongly support this proposal. This proposal is very helpful for academic institutions in United States to attract talents from all over the world.

In the past, diversity at academic institutions has made great contribution to the advance of science and technology. STEM students from other parts of the world contributed significantly to corporate projects or academic researches during their OPT period. With this new proposal for the STEM OPT extension, more and more STEM students would be able to use their knowledge in real-world training and help in the development of engineering and science fields. This OPT extension is important in that many projects for training after graduation take more than 12 months. Therefore, an extension would enable students continue with their training until the end of their projects.

Also, if STEM OPT extension is cancelled, students who are currently involved in projects using their OPT/OPT extension would be forced to interrupt their projects at once. And this would result in a loss to not only academic institutions in United States but also companies that work with STEM students. 

Therefore, I strongly support this proposal and I believe United States would benefit from providing 24-month OPT extension to STEM students.
