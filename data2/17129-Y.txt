I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international Electrical Engineering master student from China. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Germany and Britain. The most important reason I chose to study here was that US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. OPT extension is very attractive to attract international STEM students. This is why so many talented student wanted to come to the US and stayed in the US.The new OPT extension policy will obviously contribute to high tech companies choosing talented students.
Moreover, 12 months regular + 24 months extension time will be a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous internship experience, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.
As in my own case, I major in integrated circuit. Actually in China, there are a lot more opportunities in China. The only reason I want to stay here for 2 or 3 years is that I want more work experiences. I'll finally go back China. I think most Chinese students think so. 
As said above, OPT extension to 24 months is definitely a good thing for both America and international students.
