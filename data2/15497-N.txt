I am concerned with the signicant growing number of unemployed American stem wokers.
One Silicon Valley high teck company was caught forcing out some of their vetern US workers and replacing them with cheaper salaried foreign workers. They are and will use and or abuse this program to lower their labor expense to the detriment of their current US citizen workers. They will also not have to pay FICA and Medicare taxes on these foreign workers which is estimated to cause billions of $ short fall for Social Security ans Medicare. This is not good economics and not fair to our loyal US stem workers and recent Ammerican graduates with stem degrees who will loose these jobs to foreign import workers. Therefore I am against this program.
