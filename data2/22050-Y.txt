Dear officer,

I'm an International STEM student who really appreciate the 24-month extension. I believe this act is good for everyone.

Longer extension creates larger value for the society. America is built by elites from different races and culture. The STEM International students are those elites who are able to create values for the U.S. Longer time enables them a comparatively stable working condition, which guarantees their working quality. With such quality, the society would prosper in every aspect, technology, science, economy, etc. Besides, longer working time outputs steady and continuous contribution to America people. Scientific study, for example, if cut off within a short period of time, will not be picked up. Thus, what the government has devoted before all goes to waste. So a shorter time of opt extension, to some extent, equals to zero. In order to maximizing the benefits of STEM graduates, a longer extension will harvest.

As for students, we need a longer extension before we find a job back in our countries. First, raised in different cultures, we are more used to our native environment than American. So that wish encourages us to build our life back in home town. I have a lot of mideast friends. They all dream of going back and putting what they have learnt into their working areas. However, before serving our own societies, we need a good resume. That why we want a longer extension. In many countries, people are hired with good salaries because of their American education background, American working experiences, and International networking. It's especially obvious in my country. No one wants to start with a low paying in their homeland. That is why we eagerly want more time practice in the U.S.

In general, a 24-month-extension benefits both sides. Students will have a better career plan after practicing in America. That encourages them to work hard, and thus, hardworking creates value for the America society.

Thank you for your time!
