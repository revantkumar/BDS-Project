It is very important if US wants to be competetive in 21st century. I do not understand what is the issue with legal skilled migration which congress wont take and pass for the benefit of the country. The misconception that these people take American job is baseless as every American should know that a H1B is only issued by DOL when there is no suitable candidate found for that job in the country and same is also true for people who get employment based green cards. 

So even if you stop this program and deny skilled people coming here it is not solving the country skilled shortage requirement. 

Unfortunately legal immigration has become hostage to illegal immigration and a excuse for petty politician not to do anything.
