Anonymous U.S. tech companies grow fast thanks to immigrant workers. Great entrepreneurs create great companies, but remember it was talented and diligent immigrants who are contributing their time and effort to continue the greatness.

It is obvious that excluding immigrant workers, Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook or any other tech giants would definitely earn much less, and their financials will definitely miss Wall Street's expectations, which will lead to further economic downturns in this already weary economy.

There are also free marketing and advertising benefits for tech companies. It is said that the smartest engineers on earth are working hard to make people clicking ads these days. This is true. What is also true is that, these immigrant workers, be it on purpose or not, are marketing the company and their products to their social circles. People starting to know Airbnb, Snapchat, or other fast growing startups thanks to the immigrant workers who are working in that company and telling their families and friends about it. They are great assets for the company.

This regulation will definitely do more good than harm to the U.S. economy.
