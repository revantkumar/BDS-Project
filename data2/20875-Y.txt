This proposal should definitely be approved for the following reasons:

1. International students with STEM degrees provide for the skilled workforce required by all industries in the USA.
2. Many of these students have contributed significantly to the US economy by devoting their knowledge and skills 
3. International students spend much more in tuition and other expenses compared to domestic students and they should be given enough time to gain sufficient experience as well as recover some of the money invested in their education. 

I strongly believe that most of the international students intend to return back to respective countries. However, they just need more time to gain industry experience after their education to build a good profile and have a career when they return back.
