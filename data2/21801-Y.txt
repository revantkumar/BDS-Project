STEM area is not where those unemployment lose their jobs. STEM students are mainly hired by high-tech enterprises, particularly in internet business. An individual want to success in these area must take a dozen of year training to grab sufficient skills. Most of them have master degree or higher. Hence even there's no F1 STEM students, it wouldn't help those unemployment and veterans. The problem is who would pay for the expense of training them to become qualified STEM workers, not who steal their jobs away.
