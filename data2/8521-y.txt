Harshil Janak Shah There is a false news being spread against the international students on OPT that they do not pay taxes. I would like to clarify this baseless statement.

International students on OPT pay the full federal as well as the state tax. The only exempt they get is FICA taxes (social security and medicare taxes). 

This is justified as they do not get any social security or medicare benefits. Also, they have paid huge international tuition fees. 

For example, if a student is working for a firm in New Jersey and he earns 6000 dollars a month, 
he still pays 1374.9 dollars of tax ($ 1101.56 federal tax + $ 228.92 state tax + $ 40.50 SUI/SDI + $ 5.40 SLI ). 
His exempt is just 459 dollars ($ 372 Social Security + $ 87 Medicare ) in the form of social security and medicare.

This small tax exempt is like peanuts for him, considering his overall tax deduction plus the thousands of dollars he has paid in the form of international tuition fees.

Also as I said he is not liable to any benefit from social security and medicare.

An average student spends $50000 in the form of direct and indirect expenses till he graduates.
International Students added 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. 
International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014. 
For every 7 international students enrolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. 

International students are not a burden to the economy as they do not claim any free money but only contribute thousands
of dollars in the form of their education expense and taxes after getting a job. They are a huge catalyst to US economy.

For the US economy, innovation, research and legal immigration, this extension is very vital. I strongly support this rule and urge DHS to pass this rule on priority.
