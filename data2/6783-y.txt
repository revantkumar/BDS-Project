Yuheng Du, Clemson University As a student here, I feel disappointed with so many negative review against the 24 month opt extension for STEM students. For me, the 24 month OPT extension is a great proof of American's long history of respect of people with talents, which lead to and insures the prosperous technology advances here at the U.S. 

I can see a lot of talents going away from the U.S. if the act does not get approved. It will be a pity for not letting this act continue to bring the most important factor for making the U.S a great technology lead of the world, which is the human resources.

As for the opponents for this act, if we look back in history, there are always plenty of haters which are feared of new technology and more talented people reversing the life that they are used to. What will this attitude bring? I guess nothing but holding back of making American continue to be the greatest country in the future.
