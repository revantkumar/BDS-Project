Kevin Wu My name is Kevin W. I am a Senior Hardware manager for a U.S. owned compary; Oracle Corporation.

I fully support the proposal that would allow such F-1 STEM students who have elected to pursue 12 months of OPT in the United States to extend the OPT period by 24 months (STEM OPT extension). I support the 24-month extension to effectively replace the 17-month STEM OPT extension currently available to certain STEM students.
I also support the need for these students to have attended accredited universities within the United States.

The students we hire into Oracle have Master degrees and are very high quality engineers. They are an extremely valuable
asset to Oracle in developing hardware and are benefiting the U.S. corporation Oracle by creating Intellectual Property owned here in the U.S.

Extending the OPT to 24 months allows these employees to more readily be selected for H-1B visas. This allows them to work in the U.S. at Oracle and further benefit domestic Intellectual Property development. Please feel free to contact me if I cna help support this effort.
