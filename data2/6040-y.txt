Anonymous I welcome this amendment to extend the OPT period for STEM graduates. Its great to see DHS taking this initiative that would help many American companies to have continued service from top class graduates from around the world. Recently I have seen many forums who spoke against foreign workers and asking for local jobs. They are not understanding the basic fact that for an American company to be the best in the world, they need the best talent in the world which eventually boosts the American economy itself.This amendment will have a long term impact on US Tech industry, with all these companies able to keep their competitive edge.
