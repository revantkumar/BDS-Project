This proposal is awful and harms American workers, present and future.

I oppose it totally. 

We have too many foreign workers now who are, or whom have, displaced American workers. Who in the world is proposing these ridiculous policies? 

Workers and employers need to pay into Social Security and pay FICA taxes. It is out and out wrong to exempt any group. This provides preferential hiring to those foreign student graduate/foreign workers.

Something stinks in DHS if this is something that the agency originated and supports. I suspect it is the idea of the President and his advisors who will benefit financially from this policy. Could our Technology Lobbyists be the actual authors of this idea? 

I say no and I hope it will not be implemented.
