Advanced technology, especially Internet plays an important role in USA's GPA. The reason that Internet company in USA can lead in the world is due to International students' great contribution. They does not occupy any position that belongs to USA citizens, but create more job opportunities for themselves through their hardworking and so as to increase the USA's GPA. Also, thanks to more and more International students' coming, there is obvious increase in tourist industry, catering industry and so on, which means more job opportunities and more money for USA citizens. 
In conclusion, International students are not competing with USA citizens, but help USA compete with other countries and is very helpful to create more job positions and increase the GPA for both USA and its citizens. Therefore, it is ridiculous and unreasonable to shorten the OPT for International students, which means driving away them from USA.
