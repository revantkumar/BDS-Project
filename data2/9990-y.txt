Zhengyi Wu, University of Pennsylvania I strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degree. Here are the main reasons:

1. The country has spent huge amount of money on training the STEM students. This can be manifested by the amount of research funding put into these trainings. Therefore, it will really hurt the interest of United States if the US-trained STEM students have to leave the country. Because if this happens, that means all of the funding put into the training are essentially wasted. In addition, the US-trained STEM students will then work for other countries in the world, to advance their technology and science. This will definitely make US less competitive.

2. A lot of the F-1 STEM students will eventually get a green cards and citizenship and stay in US. These talented students specialized in important fields will significantly benefit the country for a long time. 

3. Overall, the US is in shortage of STEM-related jobs. So, blocking foreign F1 students will not not really help the job market for US students - the job market is already good. 

4. Sure, there is competition. But this kind of competition will still exist even without international students. After all, the economy needs competition. 

Given these arguments, I strongly believe it will hugely benefit United States to improve and expand training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degree.

Thank you.

Z. Wu
