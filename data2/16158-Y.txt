I strongly support this proposed rule. The extended OPT for F-1 students will give American companies more time and more opportunity to find best employees from the international graduates. Attracting and employing best personals from all over the world is very essential for the U.S. to keep leading the world in technology and economy in the future. The practice of this rule will not reduce the employment rate for native american in a long terms, since a good economy states is the most important factor to reduce unemployment.
