I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This is a tragedy. The American students are competing with foreign students on education opportunities. Now, it's working opportunities. Foreign students are coming from wealthy families, and their tuition are paid up front. With the proposed expanding OPT program, American students now facing the challenge of paying off their students loans because employers have more incentives for hiring foreign students. The economy of this country is going be worse and worse. As a country, you can't even secure lawful citizens' rights to get education and work opportunity. It's pathetic.
