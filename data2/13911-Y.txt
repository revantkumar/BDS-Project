Hi,
I strongly oppose the extension of the existing program, because it will seriously undermine the prevaling wage levels in certain jobs because of an increasing flow of suitable candidates who are willing to work for much less. Moreover, any increase in the STEM extension without a commensurate increase in the H1 B numbers will lead to a spiraling effect where the number of applications to the H1B guest worker program will increase exponentially each year. A simple scrutiny by the DHS into the avenues where current STEM OPT students work will easily reveal to them that a major fraction of them works in IT consulting firms, which in most cases, is not related to their field of study( a requirement of the STEM extension). A further increase in STEM extension only puts the genuine candidates at greater competition for visas, and allow the Indian body-shopping companies to continue importing cheap labor from abroad at the expense of American workers. Also, it is very unfair to other foreign workers who graduate in non STEM fields as it increases competition for the H1B visas. In my view, a general reform of the H1B program should be done before this program is increased to a 24 month extension. Steps like the administrative burdens stated in the new rule are certainly welcome as the restrictions would go a long way to prevent bogus consulting firms from exploiting talented foreign students because of their immigrant status and help genuine students by reducing the competition in the guest worker visa program.
