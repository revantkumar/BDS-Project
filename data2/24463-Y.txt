I came to USA to pursue my PhD degree in Computer Engineering in 2001. With OPT, I successfully landed a job in one of the biggest high tech company after graduation. Every once a while, I will hear some noise saying OPT/H1B takes job away from Americans. This is absolutely ridiculous. Unite states America is built by the immigrants. Without high quality immigrants, it cannot maintain its leadership in the world. Please don't take the American dreams away from F1 students!!!!
