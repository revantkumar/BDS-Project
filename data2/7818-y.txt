Sherry Zhu The OPT extension is a wise dicision by offering more opportunities for those who will really contributes to the U.S. Economy. A country accept diversity is a country that develops. Various culture and wisdom will benefit this country in several aspects, economy, culture, innovation, and sustainable development. I would love to see extended OPT providing legal status for those international students to contribute for our nation.
