The OPT extension policy would bring good opportunities to international STEM students, as well as the tech industry in the United States. Only a small portion of American students want to major in Engineering and technology at college, not to say start a career in this area. As a result, the high talent demand in this still-developing field could not be fulfilled with citizens alone. And the OPT extension just gives a high flexibility for tech companies to keep talents, even with other existing immigration restrictions like the working visa lottery. This extension will definitely bring benefits to the tech industry in the country by keeping talented people stay and contribute.
