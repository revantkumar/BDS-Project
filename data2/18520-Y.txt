I support the new rule proposed by Department of Homeland Security. After earning a degree from prestigious US university, many students find it difficult to believe 
that they have to be dependent on Lottery/Random selection to obtain visa. Given that the previous STEM extension provided very less time, students used to be worried about these non-academic things.

New rule proposed by Department of Homeland Security will ensure that qualifying students will have to be less dependent on result of random selection process and students can focus on the important projects that they are working on. I believe, the new rule will bring more collaboration in various academic fields, which will be beneficial to academic entities, industry and United States.
I liked the idea of E-verify employment eligibility criterion as it will help preserve the integrity of the program. 

Again, I would like to thank Department of Homeland Security for proposing the new rule and giving us the opportunity to convey our opinion.
