Jesse Zhou I strongly support the proposal since it helps provoke the development of various industries in USA. 
International students have different interests in certain industrial fields from American students. For example, as far as I know from college, advanced battery development is the research field where most professors and students are foreigners and they had made great contributions to it. As energy storage has been a such a critical issue all over the world, it would be very beneficial if these international students have opportunities to apply what they learnt into battery industry in USA. 
The same goes for many other STEM subjects. Also, one year is not long enough for their contribution. three-years would be a more appropriate term to make a good progress.
