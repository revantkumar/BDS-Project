I strongly support this new ruling. 

As we all know that the States higher education has been long short of enough students to do research. If the attractiveness of the States education went down because of the cancellation of the extension, then the researches would be the first victim. The States will lose its biggest advantage over other countries and will eventually lose its power. 

Some people mentioned that the States does not have a shortage of stem workers, which is so untrue. The companies not only need stem workers, but truly qualified skilled workers. A master student who have been in the university for 6 years is not the same as someone who attend a training course for 3 months. The poor high school stem education prevents the universities to produce enough skilled workers. Thus the States need more master students to contribute to the economy.

The fundamental reason for the extension to be 24 months is that a lot projects are 2~3 years long. It would be very much a trouble for companies to switch among different workers for the projects. Some potential projects even require more than five years' work and investment. 
In summary, I think OPT extension is not a threat to the States and citizens, but rather a benefit for exactly the States universities, companies, economy.
