I strongly recommend this proposed rule, This is a long awaited rule and should've been implemented much earlier. By allowing only 12 months of OPT it is not fair to the international students who have come from far countries in order to obtain most advanced information on technology and to get hands on experience . Retaining students who graduate from US universities will surely be a boost to the tech industry here rather than causing them to leave which is a Brain Drain. I saw some comments saying giving jobs to foreigners is corrupt and American students come first. Of course you are given priority before us. Have you ever wondered how tough it is to get a decent job and maintain status? Instead of saying we are foreigners why don't you check out where your ancestors are from? This is a nation built by immigrants. The land of the Free and home of the Brave. It will always be free to who ever wants to stay legally. You can show your anger towards the illegal immigrants. period.
