Why do companies even bother to hire foreign students if they have substitutable American peers? Complaining about your miserable conditions will not make any change! If you want a better job, keep passionate and work hard. I can't see any hope in America if its people are always complaining rather than strengthening their skills to make themselves stronger in job markets.
