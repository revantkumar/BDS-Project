Weiying Xu I agree with Homeland Security's new rule about extending STEM extension to 24 months.
I think this rule, if granted, will give more support to the on-going science research in the United States. International students are an integral part of the scientific research field. As we know, many of these researches, especially life science researches, take 2-5 years to complete. So the new rule is important to ensure the international graduates in this area have more time to complete their research with good quality.

Furthermore, for every 7 international students enrolled, 3 U.S. jobs are created or supported by spending occurring in the following sectors: higher education, accommodation, dining, retail, transportation, telecommunications, and health insurance.
