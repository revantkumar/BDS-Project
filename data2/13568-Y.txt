It's a great proposal. For those Americans who is worrying about internationals taking away jobs from you, please remember, it's the diversity, equality that makes your country the strongest country in the world. If you can't find a job, before you blame it to someone else, please take a deeper look at yourself first. You have better language skills than those international students, why don't you just try as hard as they do.
