I strongly support this OPT new extension based on the following reasons:
1. OPT extension does not mean every STEM foreign student can find job here in the States. They have to be outstanding enough to find jobs in their professional field. It means they are capable of contributing their excellent professional knowledge they studied in the USA to this country. No matter if these foreign students can get their OPT extended or not, those native people without capabilities are difficult to find a job. Those STEM majored foreign students are not the reason they can't find a job.
2. High technology industry needs those STEM majored foreign graduates. And America needs those high tech companies. Because all those world class high technology companies are one of the key factors which makes USA the most powerful country in the world.
