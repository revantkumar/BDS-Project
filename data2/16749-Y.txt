The proposal of extending the OPT period by 24 months makes a lot of sense. It not only helps ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study, but also provides US companies with a greater pool of talents that would otherwise go to other parts of the world and compete against US companies with the knowledge and skills they acquired from US schools. I totally support this proposal.
