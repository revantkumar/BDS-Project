Lily Kumar I support this rule. WIth this new rule we can attract more international students to come to the U.S. for their study and research. This will help our higher education and research facilities. These students can also contribute their skill to the U.S. using what they have learned here. Giving them more time to use what they learn would for sure benefit both parties.
