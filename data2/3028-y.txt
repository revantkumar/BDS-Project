Rama Sai Puvvada Expanding the OPT extension period would be very helpful especially for the foreign graduate students.

The foreign graduate student who completes his masters in 24 months and awaits to get a job that will match his skill and interest, this is not going to happen just like that or immediately after his master and in the 12 months of OPT. Students require some time to settle down and test their skill-set and to decide to continue in the path they have chose.

If OPT extension is not there and if student doesn't get the H1b VISA he/she has to leave the country in state of confusion of about what his future be.

International students come to this country for quality education and for industrial exposure by spending loads of money, so international students should be given a chance to workout their careers by giving sufficient time for choosing their path correctly. 

So i strongly recommend the OPT extension period of 24 months.
