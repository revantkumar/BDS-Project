I support the regulation of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees. This regulation is 100% necessary for the U.S. Here are the reasons. It has been almost seven years since last economic crisis. Now, we are glad to see that the U.S. economy is roaring again. What is the driving force? I would like to say the TECHNOLOGY. We are the leading nation of innovation in technical area in the world. Numerous inventions and standards are created by us. Then what is the base for our leading position for technology? It is STEM workers and students. Science! Technology! Engineering! Math! Without these hardworking people, we cannot achieve what we have today. However, one might not be aware of some statistics about STEM workers. According to Jonathan Rothwell's article which was published in US News on Sept 15, 2015, from 2000 to 2013, the job vacancies for computer engineers are roughly 4 MILLION and the total job vacancies for other STEM majors are about twice of this number. This result is convincing because it is based on the data from Bureau of Labor Statistics. I am very impressed by one conclusion that the author made in this article and here I rephrase: DON'T BUY CLAIMS THAT THE U.S. HAS TOO MANY STEM WORKERS. Just think about this statistics my friend. Now we are facing the challenge from EU and China. How can we continue to lead for another one hundred years without these lovely international STEM students and workers? How can we call U.S. the land of dream if we just refuse their stay to work for us? Please remember we are all the descents of the immigrants. Our forefathers came to this land with nothing but skills and aspiration. For the past hundreds of years, it is because the U.S. welcomes all skilled people that makes this nation the leader of the world. SO PLEASE JOIN ME TO SUPPORT THIS REGULATION!
