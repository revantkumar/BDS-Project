I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The proposal would be helpful to keep the outstanding international students make contribution to the most important fields in US development. 

2. This proposal confirms the value of diversity in US. Nobody can deny that the diversity makes US a greater country. This is the time to help people realize this.

3. The competition in the job market caused by the international students is pushing forward the development of US and improving the competitiveness of US in the world!

All in all, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal!
