I think one major reason that United States is the country that attract intelligent people is its openness. And I think this proposal is one that accord with openness. With the OPT extended, more intelligent student will make contribution to the important fields which make US a better and powerful country. I can not even think about a reason that a reasonable person would disagree with this rule.

Those commenters who refute this rule are either being discriminate or narrow minded. They need to know that only a country that keep attracting intelligent people around the world can keep moving forward, and that is the key to remain powerful.
