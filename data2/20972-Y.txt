I support Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees. According to the latest QS world university rankings, the US has the best quality of higher education in this world. Some people thinks that the reason is America has a broad land. But why the level of higher education of Russia, China and Canada are lower than America? The answer is that America absorbs the talents from all over the world. So the new policy will benefit this country obviously.
