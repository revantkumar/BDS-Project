I suggest extending the period of OPT is a reasonable decision based on several facts. First of all, currently a big portion of U.S. economy is relying on Alien's work, which immigration visa supports them to contribute a improvement of growth of economy, especially in IT area and other STEM fields. Second,
I don't think more extension of OPT will result in the unemployment of native local citizen. Most of STEM jobs are coming from the area where the local people wouldn't like to do. Third, President is also improving the immigration system, one of the big topic is to let alien people legally work in U.S.In conclusion, I 100% support new Immigration proposal to extend Training opportunities for F-1 students.
