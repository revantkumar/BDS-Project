Wanda J. March I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason. 

First of all, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay and keep making contributions to the U.S. As we all know, the U.S. government allocates great funds to the education part every year. Most of these funds are used in the higher education such as colleges and university. Recently year, more and more international students come to U.S. for their higher education because of the best programs here. We can see that they are benefit from the education funds from the US government every year. U.S. government and the society are now expecting for the return. Keep the foreign students stay and make contribution to the U.S. is the most important way for the return.

Secondly, diversity is very important to the US workplace. International student are from all over the world. Different culture and background will introduce different kind of ideas and view points, which in turn is very good for the company's development. Nobody will deny that most of those well-known entrepreneurs in now U.S. begin their first step as an international student in the U.S. universities. 

Last but not least, competition does exist everywhere. Some people will be afraid that as more and more international student are allowed to work in US, they will compete with the U.S. citizens in the job market. However, in front a position, everybody has the same opportunity. If you are the best then you can definitely get the position. Nobody will deny that good competition will help the U.S. country to select more qualified person with ability. With the good competition, both national and international student will try to improve themselves, which in turn enhance America's ability to compete globally.
