I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE for the following reasons:
1. Talented international student can make huge profit for US economy,especially in Science area.
2. if this rule approve, more and more international students will come to America and contribute their money for US economy.
3. I just want to remind you guys, USA is an immigrant country. Diversity makes this country great. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance.
