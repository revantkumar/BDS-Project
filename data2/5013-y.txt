I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained STEM degree in US. 
On one side, US tech companies can have international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax. 
On the other side, For international students, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.
