I strongly SUPPORT this proposal, and reasons are as follows:

First of all, this proposal just provides the opportunity for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees to contribute to the U.S. It is absolutely equally competition between F-1 students with STEM Degrees and local people. NO ANY preference for these students or discrimination for local people.

Second, Government implements this policy due to the shortage of related talents with STEM Degrees in U.S. If this policy cannot be passed successfully, these talents will go to the other countries which may become a "threat" to U.S. in the future.

Third, because of these outstanding policy, more and more international students are willing to study in U.S. Excellent students will consider not only the quality of schools, but also the potential opportunities after graduation when they decide to apply for the target schools in the world.

In conclusion, if a country want to keep thriving and prosperous, he must do everything he could to attract and keep talents.
