I am fully in support of this STEM extension. I am sure this opportunity will turn out the face our America. More inventions, research,technological advancements will happen today. Foreign students are not taking jobs from Americans students. Still there are 1000's of companies who does not hire foreign students because of their VISA status. People who are saying that foreign students are taking jobs from americans, it's not true at all. Everyone get theri chances, it's just that you have to prove yourself in that situation. American students does not face hard and tough situations as foreign students.
