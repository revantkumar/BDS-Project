Meng Wang I stand in support of this policy.

So many successful companies in this country are founded by immigrants, and especially by those who managed to stay via OPT route. In this age of technology, retaining graduates with a master or phd degrees with an extended OPT program means retaining more people who are capable of advancing the lead that the US has in this field, as well as creating working opportunities for US citizen.

As it stands now, there is a shortage of graduates from STEM majors. Letting foreign students stay would not diminish the chance of US citizen, instead, it would further propel the research and development of those industries.
