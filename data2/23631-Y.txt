I SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule. Both my husband and I are international PHD students from China. The reason we came to US is that US has the best PHD programs around the world and we desired to receive the best education in US. Besides, US can provide us many industry training opportunities during PHD study or after graduation. With this OPT extension rule, more and more foreign STEM students will come to US and contribute their knowledge to US. Therefore, this new OPT rule would benefit benefit both US industries and international STEM students.

The 12 regular months with extensions of 24 months is also great for the OPT program. I think we foreign STEM workers could have enough time to become familiar with the work we are going to do and gain good experience in what we are doing. If the OPT extension time is too short, we may lose our VISA before we become familiar with our projects.

As a Chinese STEM student, of course I would go back to China in the future. If I have work experience in US with about 3 years, I would be competitive in the job market of China. 

Hope more people support this good rule!
