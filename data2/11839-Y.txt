I support this proposal because it will help American economy and will benefit all American citizens in the long run. It also contains rules to make sure that the OPT extension is not abused to avoid minimum wages but used for legitimate reasons.

Extending the length of OPT is very important to not only F1-visa holders but also American citizens. For all the people who are opposing the OPT extension, please remember:

1. This is not a zero-sum game. American people can enjoy better benefits only when America has a stronger economy.
2. Immigrants contribute a lot to American economy. According to forbes, 40% of the largest U.S. companies are founded by immigrants or their children. Think about this: if America had closed its door to those highly-talented immigrants, 40% of jobs would not even exist, and it would be much harder for common American people to find a job. 
3. Tolerant immigration policy is the single most important factor for America to become a superpower in the world. America should keep this honorable tradition.
