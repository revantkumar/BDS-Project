I strongly support the STEM extension. The reason why US can be strong is that it has been embracing capable people regardless of their nationality in the past century. The STEM extension will encourage more science and engineering students all over the world to contribute to US. They are not the robbers who rob the natives of their jobs. Instead, they introduce competition and accelerates US economy.
