There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree.

The proposed "training improvements" circumvent hiring American workers at a competitive wage. 
They also end up compromising immigration laws as there is no effective system to monitor and control VISA holders length of stay.

It is reported that many Americans with STEM degrees are not working in their specialties and the reasons for this should be explored,
and understood prior to importing more competition in these fields.

Big Tech lobbyists have spent millions seeking immigration increases; 
but Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are laying off American employees and there are reports that Disney is forcing terminated
American workers to train their foreign hired replacements.

None of these conditions support the need for the proposed rule; rather a reduction in the opportunities for work in the US 
for F-1 students seems more appropriate.
