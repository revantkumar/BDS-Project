I support to expand training opportunities for F1 students. It will encourage international students to improve their technical skills as well as create a large amount of economic incomes for companies in United States. Information technology, considered as one of fast increasing industries, is changing people's life and create more new career opportunities. It encourages more people to join it, no matter native Americans or internationals. The nature of IT is sharing, open and equal, students with different background can innovate and speed up the development of IT from different ideas, which definitely make up much progress!
