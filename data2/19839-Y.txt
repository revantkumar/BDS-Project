I abdolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT.
I'm an international computer science master student from China. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents.Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) related industries like manufacturing, finance, professional services, and trading are great contributors (around 55%) to the US GDP (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2014 data) . BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 
STEM students all experienced high education in the US. They are LEGAL TAX PAYERS and very self-disciplined. They contribute to the economy as much as, if not more, than US citizens. We all know US is in big amount of debt for this social welfare which gives its economy a trouble. If we keep those young people in our country and let them keep paying taxes. It will release the financial burden of US significantly. With the taxes paid by opt users, we can build a better medical system, build infrastructures, reduce poverty and support for interesting scientific research.
