Cheryl Wu To whom may concern,

I think it's a good proposal. First of all, it definitely gives more consideration to those F1 students who are using their training opportunities working for companies based on US. Not only the students have chances to learn more at a practical environment, but also the companies will have more workforce who has STEM background and improve their diversity. Second, the training opportunities, especially its extension, was originally proposed partially because that H1B quota got filled up quickly especially these years. This proposal is an improvement at all aspects, a deny on this would be a huge regression, discouraging students have STEM background to contribute. Last but not the least, it's giving companies more choices of candidates, my company has been trying to fill some software developer openings, and we are pretty happy about the fact we can receive a good amount of STEM resumes and pick the best for us. I am not sure the situation will be the same if the training opportunities got hold back.

Thanks,
CherylWu
