F1 visa is an amazing opportunity for international students to gain knowledge and skills in cutting edge technology and other fields. It also benefits the american economy by matching better skilled work-force to meet the fastly growing technological opportunities. STEM extension provides more ROI for employers who has invested in training the international students during OPT. Extension of STEM to 24 months will further improve the employer's returns and provide the students an opportunity to hone their skills in their respective STEM major.The proposed time period of OPT extension is only upto 24 months. Students would still require to convert into H1B to remain in the work force. Hence increasing the extension will have no negative impact on the american work force. It will provide more experienced students working on OPT which adds to the productivity and economy of this great nation. This is a tremendous step that will benefit F1 students and employers alike. I support this proposal.
