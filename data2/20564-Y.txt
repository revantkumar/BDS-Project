Hi
I am pursuing M.S. in Computer Science by Feb / May 2016. During my masters I have leaned lot of new things which I did not hear.
Now I want to explore myself based on what I learn. One year is not sufficient for me to do this. If I work here on OPT for One Year then If did not got H1B, it could be a problem for future,

Lot of F1 students like me, may face same situation.

I believe 3 year OPT program is the best proposal for STEM students
