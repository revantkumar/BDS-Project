Xiao Wang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. As a MS student, I paid a lot of tuition to study here. If I was told that the OPT extension will cancelled, I probably would choose another place to study. 

2. I think it's beneficial for the U.S. economy to extend the OPT. My friends who are working or studying in the U.S. spend a lot of money every year. They purchase everything here, for themselves, family and friends. 

I appreciate the good initiative by the government. OPT extension is very important for international students on their career life.
