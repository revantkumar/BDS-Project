I studied in uk before I came here. Initially I thought this is a platform where international students can get jobs and do the stroke of work. But the recently disagreement about this OPT extension makes me wonder that this country does not welcome international students. It sounds like US is more like a "feudatorial society". Some short-sighted people are trying to shut the door for these young people. They are harmless and more than helpful to both economy and technology.
I can't see why people have to object the decison. Those fresh and creative ideas and thoughts that these students bring are extremely valuable. 

Hope more people support this good rule.
