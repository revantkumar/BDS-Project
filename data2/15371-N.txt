Hey Regulations.gov. I am an American born native New Yorker. How about you mooks immediately stop selling out to the foreigners and sleeper cell terrorists that are disguised within them!? You people need to show allegiance and devotion to this country called the United States of America. I should do your job instead so I could happily provide more jobs to the struggling American citizens in this country. Where do I sign up for this?
