Though most of the comments seem positive, I see some people commenting negatively towards such a great rule. Most of these negative comments have 2 statistical figures:

1.) OPT removed 4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds
2.) OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.

I would like to counter this argument with some real time statistics and data:

Counter to 1.) International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. If you analyze it from 2009-2013, it is a very huge figure close 100 billion dollars. (way more than the 4 billion dollars you are mentioning now and again ). You must be aware about thousands of dollars they pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. 

Counter to 2.) International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014. For every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. (leaps and bounds ahead of the 430,000 jobs over the span of 4 years 2009-2013, that you are mentioning time and again). 

Also consider those millions jobs which they will generate when they start their own enterprises with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. These are the students with masters and PHD's. You let them go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students.

To support my statement, I am attaching an official survey of NAFSA for the year 2013-2014 'The Economic Benefit Of International Students.

It is a very detailed assessment. Please take a look.

Please pass the rule and take care of those thousands of students which will go out of status on Febru
