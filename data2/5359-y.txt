Yanqi Li I am an international student in STEM field. What I think about STEM extension is that it will do a lot good for our international student. Actually, I am now a master student and prepare to work in U.S for some years and go back to my home country. And I do know that a lot of my friends think that too. If we get Master Degree in U.S. and then immediately go back to our country to search for employment, that will make us not very competitive comparing to students who go for job hunting as soon as they get Bachelor's Degree. Master's Degree normally is very short, and if we have enough time to stay in U.S. to work for a while, it definitely will improve our skills and raise our competitiveness. Indeed, students who want to immigrate is not the most of us. We have families back at home and our friends and our culture. Then only thing we want to do is to make us more competitive during working here. 
And universities as well want us to get good jobs in U.S. I know lots of universities in U.S. hold perfect career fair and excellent trainings for masters, especially international students to help them find ideal jobs. I really appreciate that. That means our universities really want to see that all of their students have a good future right? 
Besides, whether to employ a student is decided by companies. It is not that STEM extension is a policy that force companies to hire international students. They have their choice. What we, international students, can do is to better ourselves to meet the criteria. And I think that will help U.S.'s industry to get better employees no matter they are international or domestic.
Thank you for your consideration for my own thoughts. And please give us a chance.
