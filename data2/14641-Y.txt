I definitely think the OPT stem extension is beneficial to American economy. Companies especially high-tech companies hire international students because there just not sufficient amount of qualified workers in the market. One of my friend told me that their company was seeking a web developer last year and wanted to hire a citizen, and they were unable to fill the position for a year. It's not just big companies will suffer from the shortage of talent, small companies would not be able to survive without these well-trained foreign employers. 

btw, international students are not cheap labors, their average salary are higher than the American household income.

Therefore I strongly support this proposal.
