I do support the proposal of OPT extension of 24 months instead of 17 months. This makes it close to sufficient time for a student to take his/her study out in practice which is next step after learning in the class. The practice makes a full circle of learning process. 

Not only this will help the student to practice the study he/she learnt in class but also, helps the nation's economy, research and innovation. These students act as a highly skilled resources to help the country to lead in technology. These students with their advanced skills, bring diverse background and experience which is an ingredient of a better team effort.
