Why are you trying to overrun this country with foreigners to take American jobs. We neither want or need these people in a country that can no longer afford the citizens it's has. In my opinion it's a very Stupid idea and Homeland Security should start thinking about what's in the best interest of this country and stop trying to re-populate this country with these people that the American people don't want in this country.
