I strongly agree with the new OPT rule for the following reasons:

1.OPT program can attract millions of foreign students come to US for studying. Most of them pay their tuition and living expense by themselves. For this reason students parent will visit them sometime and this benefit american thousands of industries like tourism, food, car and others. As we know, most of US University or college are in lack of funding status, foreign students high expense tuition can greatly release college and University financial problem. Native students also benefit from it because most of native students need scholar ship and tuition waiver. The money foreign students contribute to University and College can make them operate well and keep high quality education which also benefits millions of native students. 

2. Most of IT company especially small company they are eager to hire Americans instead of foreigners for the native works protection policies and US owns millions of such small companies. I don't believe foreign students are able to take away Americans jobs. Most small companies they will firstly hire Americans not foreigners because foreigner have the high risk of not able to work for a long time for the reason of work authorization which Americans won't have such problem. Foreigners has language limitation and most of them can't socialize into companies culture. Companies need to pay H1b application fee and lawyers fee to help them to apply H1 petition and still have the high risk of losing them because of current H1B cap.

3.OPT STEM students are highly educated people and skilled. Extend OPT will make them to stay in US and benefit US technology. If not, they will go back to their country, at that time US companies will pay more to hire them back. That is kind of lose for US.
