I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 

1. The American Dream is actually providing people who live and study in United States equal opportunities for seeking employment. This is a great way to ensure the communication between United States and other countries and improve from it. And also it is a very efficient way to attract foreign students choose to study here, since United States provide better rules of after school opportunities. 

2. It is the great chance for those students who studied here to serve the country they studied in. The best way to use the talented people and stop United Sates from losing talented people. 

3. It will bring competition, but competition is a good thing for both U.S. citizens and foreign students. This is the best way for them to learn from others and improve their skills from the competition.
