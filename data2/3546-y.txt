Guoda Liang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

a)Immigrants are making HUGE CONTRIBUTION to the country, especially in the technical and engineering field. The denial of this proposal will in fact impose a negative impact on the economy of U.S.
b)Diversity is what makes America strong and invincible. By denying this proposal, we are actually robbing America of its diversity.
c)Immigrants and citizens can co-exist. The main reason of unemployment lies in economy itself, not immigrants.
