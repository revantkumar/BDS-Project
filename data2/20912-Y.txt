I support this proposal. It's a good thing to give these well-educated guys a chance.

opt is a very very important element to attract international students, who pay much tuition to support US colleges/universities. (As I know, tuition fee of international students commonly as double as native students.) Not enough native Americans would like or be able to work in STEM (especially in Computer Science/Electronic/Statistic). However whose talented and well-trained international students in OPT status could give a huge contribution to the US high-tech field. So why dont US government give them, also give ourselves an oppotunity to develop both our technology and economy?

Our country is known and respected for diversity and inclusiveness, because of these more people come here to contribute them to the society. Thus the US can have todays international standing and prestige. 

All in all, I don't think opt extension would hurt native americans benefits, nevertheless it will have lots of positive impacts to the country.
