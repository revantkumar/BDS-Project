I think it's time to turn our attention to American people. We need to take care of our own and stop caring for everyone else. We give our jobs to non Americans and our money to non Americans before long America won't even belong to us. Stop this nonsense and get back to the great country we once were. I'm so depressed about the way our country has gone and I hope we can turn it around.
