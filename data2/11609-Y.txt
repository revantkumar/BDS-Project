This was a nice proposal, all the students who explored their minds in their field of study got a pretty good opportunity to learn and implement the new ideas into their respective fields. By this their interest towards their fields and the ability to learning and improvising their ideas will get higher and higher which leads to the increase in enthrapranurship, job opportunities, creating more jobs. I think this rule will be definitely useful for the economy of this country as well. 

Thank you Land Of Oppurtunities.
