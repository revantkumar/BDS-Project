For several years now Immigrents, legal, illegal and refugees have been placed ahead of U.S. citizens. You have sent billions of our tax dollars to other countries for food, loans to foriegn countrys and Military equipmant, yes and even the lives of our oved ones. While you send all these things over seas, you continue wreak our nation. 

This hatred of Americans and the abusive spending of our money by these Federal mandates must stop!! If you can't comply with the Consitution, then have the decency to step down. We do not want an increase of immirants of any kind. In 7 years we have achieved greater debt than we have every had, we have higher unemployment ( just because you aren't counting those no longer looking for work or counting part time now as full time, doesn't mean we don't have high unemployment.) Do not increase ways to bring in more immigrant or exten thier stay or let them take jobs away from American citizen. This proposed rule expanding for made up issues is not fair and is costing jobs for American.
