Meryle A. Korn I commend everyone who pursues an education, regardless of whether they come to America for that purpose or were born here. I received my BA from a state college/university in 1965. From my freshman year in 1961-'62 until my graduation in 1965, tuition increased from $90/quarter to $130/quarter. I'm amazed and appalled by how high tuitions are in 2015! Nevertheless, I still believe that anyone who goes to college, again, wherever they came from, deserves support.
