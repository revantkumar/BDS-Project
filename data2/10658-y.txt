Donald Williamson PLEASE note that this rule is for F-1 NONIMMIGRANT STUDENTS rather than foreign workers. Its only purpose is to attract more TALENTED students coming to this country. F-1 students are only allowed to work for a total amount of three years here, at the ages when their intelligence and energy levels are at the very peak in their whole lives. From this perspective of view, this new rule is beneficial for our country.
