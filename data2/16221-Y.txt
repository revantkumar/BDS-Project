I strongly Support the proposal!

As an international students, I really contribute a lot the U.S. I learned technology skills and would like to contribute my skills. The U.S should let the international students stay longer so that we can boost the technological and economic development of the U.S.

Companies would like to hire people who is qualified for the job. We do not stole the jobs from U.S. citizens. The competition we bring will generate a win-win strategy. It can let people to enhance and increase their skill and give our companies more choices. And actually, U.S. citizens already have a natural edge, since they do not need sponsorship and have language advantage. It is harder for international students to get a job than native students.
