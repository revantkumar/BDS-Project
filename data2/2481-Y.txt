I think the 24 month extension is a good thing. On the one hand, STEM students can related the theories learned in school to real world experience, especially for graduate students, where they have tons of knowledge related to today's high tech. On the other hand, for companies, especially small or startup companies, they need those students to help bring the profits. It is actually generating more revenue and more job positions, for both US workers or other OPT students.
