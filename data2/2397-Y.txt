I strongly support this regulation.
1.Obviously, a long OPT will definitely attract more foreign scholars and talented students to America, which is obviously good for America Technical Companies. We can see from the fact that foreign people have made a lot of contributions to America Technical and economy progress
2. If this regulation don't get passed, it can be conceived that America shows a unfriendly attitude to foreign scholars and technical talents, which can lead to a decrease in the number of people from other countries studying in America. We all know what make America such a great nation -- the social inclusion and respectiveness for people from all kinds of background. If this regulation get rejected and abolished, this kind of American spirits is damaged and that is a really bad beginning.
