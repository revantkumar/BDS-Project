Mingjia Chen I believe the proposed rule is a great opportunity to attract talented students to come here and study STEM subjects. A 24-month period plus the original 12-month will give students sufficient time to train and gain experience. If STEM students can only stay here for a year, they can go to other countries that compete with U.S.

I myself is an international student with OPT. I'm a college graduate with a STEM degree class of 2015. If the proposed rule does not pass, I will be negatively impacted. The company I'm currently working for has a lot of training for new hires, I wouldn't be able to participate in all of the training if I can stay in the U.S for only a year. Because my work is also project based and each project usually lasts more than a year, I wouldn't be able to work on a project throughout the life cycle and I don't want to see that happen.
