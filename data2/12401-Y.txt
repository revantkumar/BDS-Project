Those students who use OPT extension are not cheap labors. Many hot start up companies, like Uber and Airbnb, are looking for smart engineers and these companies are willing to pay good salaries for talented candidates, but there are still not enough people meet their requirement. International students don't have a higher priority than US citizens. Hi-tech companies hire them only because they are talent in system design and have programming. 

During the past 30 years, numerous international students devoted themselves for Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon. They are not grubbing recourse from US citizen, but create more job opportunity and make a better life. 

US always welcome genius and always value diversity. I believe OPT extension is good for everyone, no matter US citizen or international students.
