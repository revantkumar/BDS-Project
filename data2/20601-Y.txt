I do not understand why so many people against this new rule, this is a free country right? You guys are so proud of that you have "freedom" written in your constitution and then, opposed of people of different race live in this land, work in this land even they are contributory for revenue? Don't you think this is kind of racial discrimination? Why don't just seal this country, drive away all foreigners? 

Half of companies in Bay Area will close for no workers. Maybe that's when you guys satisfied.
