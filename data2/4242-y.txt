Steven Harshfield The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program is crony capitalism and anti-American worker. The proposed rule would artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers. 

Young Americans in the STEM field are one of the groups who really need jobs to pay off their school loans. Now the government is considering cutting their financial opportunities? This is insanity. America does not need more half-hearted foreign workers in the STEM field. We need hard working American workers period. 

Charity begins at home or don't shoot yourself in the foot. Whatever your true-ism. it certainly does not include undercutting American workers.
