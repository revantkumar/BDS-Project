It is time to Stop giving America away! 

I am saddened to learn that both Bush presidents had succumed to big money lobbies to bypass congress and the will of the American people to illegally create the OPT program.

One crime against America does not justify another. Good Americans are sick and tired of President Obamas lawless behavior of trashing America. It is way past time for the peoples government to stop redistributing the wealth and success of America to outsiders at the expense of America and The American people who created this once great country.
