I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.

OPT has never been approved by Congress: it is yet another example of Executive Branch overreach. The DC Federal District Court has ruled that OPT has caused American workers lost jobs and lost wages. A further expansion will only further damage American workers. 

The proposed expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay, thus creating an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans.

Further, under current immigration law, F-1 visa holders are NOT allowed to hold a job in the US after graduation, and they promise to leave within 60 days of completing their coursework. This proposal violates that provision of the law.

At a time when American citizens graduating college cannot find jobs, it is wrong to give companies incentives to hire non-citizens instead of qualified Americans.
