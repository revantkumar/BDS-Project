I strongly support this new rule. First, the new OPT extension could help universities in the U.S. to attract more international students with strong background in their field of study. Second, with a longer OPT extension, more students will be able to contribute to U.S. tech companies, which could boost the development of new technologies. Third, the OPT extensions could help the companies to get more talented people working for them, which is also beneficial to the economy.
