I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. 

There are mainly three reasons for this:

(1) It is a win-win situation both for international students and US companies. It is known to all that the huge amount of international students have made significant contributions to the development of many US companies, especially those technology oriented companies. If this proposal can't be approved, then those companies will suffer a lot from lack of sufficient talented and hard-working workers to make the stable improvement of the leading techniques, which is also a bad thing for the US society.

(2) The most attractive part of US is its diversity. Only by allowing a combination of people from totally different cultures can the society be active. Different backgrounds and different experiences can produce different thoughts, inspire different insights. If international students are not allowed to stay here, then the US society will lose the chance to select the essence from other cultures.

(3) OPT policy is a selling point of the US educational market. By allowing students to work here, students can develop real world skills by actual experience and raise their competitiveness in job market, which is the main reason why international students come to US seeking for more opportunities. Those who blame this policy should ask themselves why they fear this, maybe the answer is that compared to international students, they are not good enough. International students can make the job market more competitive, which I think is not a bad thing. In this way, companies can have the chance to choose the best workers and make more profits, and everyone will try his / her best.

In sum, the approval of the OPT extension will have a profound impact on international students and the US society. I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS!
