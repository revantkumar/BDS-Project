I object to the OPT Bill.
It's not fair for those living outside of the United States to come here and take away jobs from Americans. I am sure many college students and citizens would love to have some of these jobs available to them.

It seems as though being an American citizen doesn't stand for much these days.....we are having enough difficulties supporting our own......without giving our hard-earned dollars to those who illegally cross our borders for their food, health and schooling. Let's take care of our own first!
