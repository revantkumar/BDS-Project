I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This expansion would allow foreign students to be favored over Americans because there would be no payroll taxes paid, saving companies a great amount of money.
Foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. It is imperative that this be kept in placed so that Americans can be hired for available jobs.
Our college graduates are struggling to find work and those jobs should not be give to foreign citizens.
