Lauren Payne I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity. This rule is very beneficial for retaining talented international students. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
