For those people who are claiming that the OPT are taking jobs away from the Americans, here are my two cents. Think about why companies would hire foreign student. Hiring them through OPT and H1B would bring in additional legal cost and requires a lot more effort compared with just simply hiring Americans. But companies hire foreign students anyways. Why? Because hiring decision should be based upon meritocracy, not where you were born, where you were from or what passport you hold. If the OPT program were to be canceled, this would gravely hurt the American economy, especially the tech industry. Facebook, google, and etc won't be what they were again. If they could hire Americans for all their positions, they would have done it in the first place and not be bothered with all the troubles that come with hiring foreign students.
