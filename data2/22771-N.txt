This is definitely designed to hurt American workers and give financial incentives to hire foreign workers instead of US workers. We don't need this or an increase in H1B workers. I have worked to IT for over 35 years and I know that Americans are NOT given consideration when lower wage foreign workers are available. This results in discrimination and discourages US workers from working in STEM fields.
