First all, I would like to take this opportunity to thank DHS for thinking through and proposing a great rule. This rule really encourages immigrants to go one step ahead to use the knowledge learned at the prestigious universities in USA and implement it to develop the community. I strongly support the STEP OPT extension increasing from 17-months to 24 months.
