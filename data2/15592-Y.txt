I fully SUPPORT this rule. This is a great rule that will benefit everyone. I graduated from Purdue University and I'm working in a mechanical engineering corporation in South Carolina. The company I work in is an international corporation, and people are from all over the world. We work together, we come up with new ideas together, we solve problems together and we progress together. International STEM talents won't be threat to the American citizens. Reversely, we will make huge contributions to this great country, as what we have been doing from the first day. Please approve the OPT extension rule!!!
