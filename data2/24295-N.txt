I have just read about the OPT program and have to say I am not happy about it. This program seems to me to be another unfair advantage for foreign labor over native born Americans. Why does our own government keep coming up with ways to keep the native born American at a disadvantage over foreign labor and foreign born people brought in to our own country! We have STEM students and graduates already having difficulty finding employment and we are going to stack the deck against them in yet another way! Did I serve in this country's military to give foreign born people an advantage over Americans? I also read this program allows the employee and employer to avoid Social Security taxes. If this is true, it would just add another layer to my disappointment in yet another disappointing government program. Please tell me who comes up with these programs that are blatantly against American workers. How do you expect more American kids to get into STEM fields when they are at a disadvantage from the start? The old argument that companies can not find qualified Americans does not hold water. U.S. companies like Disney and Southern California Edison among others have laid off qualified Americans and then brought in indentured H1B visa holders to take their place at less pay and then have the gaul to have them train their replacements. H1B, OPT, why do we come up with programs that do nothing but harm the American worker!
