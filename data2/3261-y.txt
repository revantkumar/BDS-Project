Kiran Veeravelly Thank you for giving me an opportunity to comment on this proposed rule. I strongly support this rule as it would create a win-win situation for both Tech companies and students pursuing STEM degrees. This rule will enable highly qualified STEM students from all over the world to contribute immensely to the advancement of U.S technological leadership and innovation.
