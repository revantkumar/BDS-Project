Melissa Willis I strongly support the policy because it will definitely benifit those tech companies in America which contribute huge share of the country's GDP. The extension of OPT for the STEM students who will bring profit to these tech companies will make both the compaies and the students more relaxed. For those students who don't plan to immigrant to the U.S., they probably intend to work in America after graduation until their OPT expired. The extension of OPT will save the recruitment cost for those tech companies because those students can stay for longer. In addition, the number of the foreign STEM students who have immigrant inclination is getting smaller because of the rapid grwoth of the tech industry in those students' home countries such as China and India. I have talked to some of my Chinese friends and they are looking forward to the life back in China because there are so many opportunities in that country. Many of them only want to gain some experience in America and use the knowledge they learn to work in their home countries. We have seen many of these examples in recent years.I believe the policy will benefit the tech industry of America and probably will contribute to the recovery of the U.S. economy.
