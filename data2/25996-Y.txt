I have been displaced by foreign workers seven times during a thirty year career. I am now fifty-one and out of work; having spent a third of my life in Information Technology. I have been told that the reason for my rejection is a lack of cultural fit. As I walked out of that particular office it became patently clear that my face would be the only native born American in the building. 

We have and continue to produce some of the brightest minds in the world. Just look at the condition of our entrepreneurial culture. Some of the best American jobs have and continue to be sent to India for political expediency and to provide more wealth to greedy shareholders. 

America needs a strong ally. The solution is to send middle class money. I am tired of experiencing a life rigged by the rich and powerful who like to have it their own way by spending other people's money. I want the wealthy to invest their own money. Take a risk like the rest of us; or are they so inept from generations of living off the fat of a crafty forefather that their brains have become soft like a cheese?

Americans are beginning to wake up to the class warfare started by the lazy rich. We can and want to have a peaceful social revolution. You simply cannot tell people to eat cake forever without repercussions. 

Stop being selfish and spoiled rich brats.
