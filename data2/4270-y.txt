Ranxing Choi You guys criticize OPT STEM extension targeted the wrong group!
Actually STEM students deserve every opportunity for legally extension. Those who consume huge social benefits are illegal immigrants, say those in California, lost of them entered US with big fatal lies and still get whole lot of benefit. So why don't you guys transfer your attention to those who should really be disqualified instead?

Nowadays hunting for a job becomes increasingly difficult for international students, they would be forced to leave US unless they finished their status transition with a diced H1B.

Besides, due to the constitution of US, citizens are always prioritized for job opportunities, yet still, numerous tech employees are permitted to get offer, especially in IT area? Yes, because your indolence, your incapability!
