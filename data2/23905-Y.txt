As an international student in United States, I strongly support the extension for OPT.
The reasoning behind that is
1. We are studying in United States, and we can contribute more to this Country if given more time to work here.
2. Most of the international students are seeking positions with relatively high salaries, we won't compete with those natives who have low salaries.
