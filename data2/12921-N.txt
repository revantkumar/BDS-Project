The United States is overpopulated as it is, we can't even fully take care of our own citizens. Increase immigration means more people which means more of a strain on the environment, increase use of natural resources such as oil, electric, coal, water which means more greenhouse gases being added in the United States plus over development of the land which drives wildlife out of their natural environment. There is also a huge national debt with a huge strain of all of our social programs mainly because we have too many illegal immigrants and too many new legal immigrants being allowed into the country while there are hurting legal American citizens who need more help but it's not available due to lack of funding of social programs simply because that extra money isn't there. Big business has also been allowed to get away with giving too many jobs away to foreign workers and outsourcing American jobs for the sole purpose of cheap overseas labor and it has got to stop because it's out of control. Big business has been getting away with too much, the don't want to pay legal American citizens a normal wage they can live on to meet their basic needs plus the government needs to close the loop holes to stop allowing companies to keep money overseas and get out of paying their taxes like everyone else. Both parties need to shape up and enforce all of these things which would bring in billions and billions of much needed tax dollars instead of putting the burden on the middle class and poor, some working 2 and 3 jobs just to barely try and meet their basic needs. Millions of Americans need to contact their members of congress and protest all over the country by the thousands if not millions and try to get at least 1 million people to protest the capital in Washington DC.
