1. The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.
2. The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers.
3. OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.

How much longer will we be giving away American jobs? Why is this seen as a positive thing? It used to be that companies were loyal to AMERICA, and kept the jobs for American citizens, and that's the way it should be. Who in their right mind would want to give American jobs to anyone other than an American citizen? American citizens are being assaulted by the companies they work for, who pay slave wages (wages having stagnated since the 70's) and keep all the profits for themselves, not sharing anything with the actual laborers. On top of that, we are sending jobs to other countries so that companies can make HUGE profits that are unfairly distributed. The whole thing just disgusts me. The government is going against everything that we, as Americans, want. Start representing us, as you're supposed to. This is not the country that my father fought for in WWII, and this is not the country I grew up in, which took care of its own.
