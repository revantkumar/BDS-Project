I was born in a traditional Chinese family in which all my family members encourage me not to pursue science because I am a girl. My family believes that boys are always better than girls in science. Four years ago my father sent me to the US to study business major. Studying in the US has changed my life and how I perceive the world and myself. After one year's study, I changed my major to Computer Science despite how much my family was against this. Living in the US made me realized that I have value and I can be a scientist even though I am a girl. After four years hard work, I finally got an offer from Microsoft. Now I have the chance to learn from the best company in the world and contribute to the most exciting leading technology. I am very happy but also worried at the same time. If the opt extension for STEM students were canceled, I only have 12 months to work and learn. 12 months are too short to accomplish anything for STEM students. It takes time to develop great science and technology. Many international students come to the US to pursue science and technology because we believe in American dreams. That is, as long as we work hard, we will be given the chance to contribute to the greatest science and technology in the world no matter where we come from. All we ask is a little more time. With the 24 months opt extension, I believe international students who are so brilliant and hardworking will have great contributions to science and technology.
