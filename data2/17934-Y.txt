I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 

Firstly, the employer in USA needs the opt extension. Or else in Feb. 2016, the employee in opt extension status will leave their position. The employer cannot find a suitable person in such a short time. All the projects in progress will be delayed. There will be a huge loss of profit.

Second, the STEM international students deserve the opt extension. When they chose to come to USA, when they chose their STEM major, they knew that there is an opt extension, which means there is a better training opportunity. That is a significant reason to choose USA and their major. 

Third, 24 months extension is necessary. Many projects would last 2 or more years. The employer needs to find another person to learn the whole progress from the very beginning, if the government lets the international students leave the country at the middle period.
