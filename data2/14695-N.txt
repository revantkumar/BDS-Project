I am an America-born STEM worker, and I ask that you not expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT). This program gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. 

Automation already requires less technical workers each year; whereas it may have taken 50 full-time workers to manage a corporate IT infrastructure in 1999, today that same job can be done by 5 or 10. This is due to the advent of sophisticated and powerful management tools that allow you to "do once, execute many times". 

In the coming years this level of automation will only become greater as it is combined with cloud-based service providers, which is aimed at selling services with the argument that you no longer need a local IT staff. I have seen successes and failures with that model, but I think we are in the point of that cycle where the pendulum has swung too far and technology workers are being throw into the streets for cheaper, poor service (see Disney's recent H1B scandal).

Please do not expand this program.
