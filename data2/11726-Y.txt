The extension of OPT is necessary for both the development of the U.S. and for the global economy. For lots of areas of subjects, e.g. environmental science, while the topics themselves are quite international, large agencies' headquarters are based in the U.S. which require the participation from citizens all over the world. Prolonging the time for students staying in the U.S. can not only help solve lots of global affairs and problems, but also increase U.S.'s national strength in global governance.
