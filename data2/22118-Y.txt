I strongly support this proposed rule because it doesn't benefit international students only but also benefit the United States too. These benefits for US covered many aspects including economy, culture and many other ones. 
Historically, international students have made great economical contribution to the United States and recently The increasing trend of the number of international students . Since international students pursuing master's degree still is the main part. They pay tuition to the college and their living expenses partially improves the local economy too. 
International students also increase the diversity and build strong communication between different cultures and US local culture. A bunch of international students participate into activities organized by local church and non-profit organizations. Many students have also joined the christian as part of the church. 
In the recent 20 years, many high-tech companies have spring up and grow in an exponential speed. So these companies need quite a few engineers to facilitate themselves. However, quite a little local Americans are willing to pursue a degree in STEM area. So the gap between the high need for high-tech elites and limited number of local students in these areas.
