Any job given to foreign students or other foreigners weakens our economy and hurts Social Security and other safety net programs. Many foreigners send a large percentage of their wages back to their home land and contribute little to the American Economy. Plus many pay no taxes or Social Security because of special programs. 

It is time for Americans to stand up and tell the wealthy to leave this country and shut down their business if they cannot compete on a global scale without hurting our economy and the people of the United States of America! There are many bright individuals who will be glad to replace them.
