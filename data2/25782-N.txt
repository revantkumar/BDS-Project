I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This program creates an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against them. WITH RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES STRUGGLING TO FIND WORK, THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO PROVIDE COMPANIES WITH AN INCENTIVE TO HIRE FOREIGN CITIZENS OVER U.S. CITIZENS

"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 yearsthe same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be validthere is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, IN VIOLATION OF CONGRESSIONAL INTENT."
