Sophia Beckham I strongly suppose the proposal for the following reasons:
US needs a larger tech-savvy workforce to maximize economic growth
Most of the US Universities and colleges will shutting their doors if the OPT extension is not given, because student will choose other countries for higher education
Total Benefit to US Economy Benefit in the range of $ 83600000000 for 5 years
Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in their field of study (Example Solar Energy, Medical Research)
Best practices from employers/industries can be reached to the Universities
Without practical training the education for 3 years will not prove to be beneficial to the students (Ex: mobile- android/iOS development)
Students acquire skills and specialized knowledge in their chosen studies
