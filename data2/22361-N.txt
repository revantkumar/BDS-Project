Quit bringing in foreigners to take Americans jobs. You can fudge the numbers all you want, but you are not fooling all the people looking for work and who have given up. Foreigners are not wanted or needed all you're doing is giving this country away and bankrupting it for those of us that belong here. Concentrate on deporting all these illegal aliens.
