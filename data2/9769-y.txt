Katherine Aragon I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. This is extremely important. If the U.S. wants to remain competitive and welcoming, we need to see this extension through. Thousands of students are depending on this, and so are thousands of families. Immigrants are contributors, not people who take away.
