I support this rule and believe it would bring great values to American economy. However, some comments are concerned that such rule would greatly reduce the working opportunity for American citizens. I find this opinion fallacious for the following reasons: 

1. American economy is rapidly recovering with a growing job market. Job opportunity has been increasing for everybody for unemployment rate has been lowered over the recent years. Concerning about international students taking all jobs is non-sense since unemployment rate is suggesting otherwise. 

2. This proposed rule is a highly regulated rule which only gives extension to international students of certain majors for a certain amount of time, which won't negatively affect American citizens' interest at all. As a matter of fact, in a free market or society, competition is usually beneficial.
