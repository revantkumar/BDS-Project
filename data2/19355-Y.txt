International students spend billions of dollars in tuition fee every fee and at the same time are contributing to the economy of united states by paying rent and other expenses. Most of the Universities depend on international students to run their masters degree programs. It would be a grave injustice if STEM extension is denied. If that ever happens then students will stop coming to US and move to greener pastures. Point in case is the United Kingdom. 

I urge the authorities to implement the new STEM rule that would allow students to contribute to the society.
