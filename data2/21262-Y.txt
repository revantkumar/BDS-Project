I support this regulation. I think it is a great way to help high tech company's increasing demand of science students. America government paid scholarship to thesestem students every year and after they graduate whysending them away? I have seen people who have stem background opening startups andhired local people to work. I believe they areactually boosters of American economy andemployment.
