I support the OPT extension not only for international students but for US citizen's benefits. I simply do not understand why some people play against those talent and highly skilled international students. If we could offer them more opportunity to contribute what they learned and skills in our industry, such as IT or any other high techs, our country will have a bigger human resource in developing new techniques and potentially keep us remaining a leading position in science and techniques.
