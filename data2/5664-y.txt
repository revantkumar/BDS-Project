Bo Zeng, UC Berkeley We all understand U.S's has prospered because it makes international talents stay. I think while some low-level low paying jobs have been obviously abused to shelter some not so talent internationals, and I totally understand the pain felt by American nationals when their necessary jobs that does not require international talents have been taken. We need to understand that this is not to eliminate the OPT program at all. What needs to be done is to make sure OPT is given to the right person, right company and right job. For example, school credibility has to be considered, job shortage has to be considered and payment has to be considered as well. It just require better algorithm in the OPT backend, not outcries by American nationals that really didn't know what is going on and distinguish the proper cases.
