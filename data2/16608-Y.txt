While pursuing my degree, I excelled with three diverse and challenging internship opportunities and provided significant revenue for the companies I worked at. All of this while paying my fair share of over 33% of my income in taxes. Apart from proactively helping to increase the popularity of my University, I have also helped two American friends receive job offers from previous companies that I interned at.

Now that I have graduated, I am trying to startup a technology company with a fellow international student. This can bring in significant revenue to the U.S. while at the same time the infrastructure and commendable market and logistics system can really help our business.
Knowing that we have to become extremely profitable in more than one year, can really help us and many more take a more sustainable path for growth.
