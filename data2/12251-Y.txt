The extension of STEM OPT time is a great policy that benefits both Students and The U.S.

The most obvious effect is that STEM students will have more time to take internships or full-time jobs after graduation. Given such opportunities, these talented young people can really work down-to-earth to create value and achieve something without worrying about their status.

Entering the Big Data era, companies also need the supply of a great amount of STEM talents to support the build of their own databases. Imagine a world without OPT, that's a nightmare for US economy.

US natives don't need to worry about the OPT policy because they already have huge advantages over foreign students. Speaking from whichever aspect, Americans would not be at the inferior position if they compete with foreigners. But if the OPT policy was cut, those Americans who are not so excellent would not have the incentive to work hard. That's not a good signal for the future of the States.

So please keep this extension policy!
