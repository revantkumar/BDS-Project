Lesley Blackner Please conduct a NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) analysis of this rule. I take issue with your finding that a "categorical exclusion" is appropriate. This proposed rule will result in population growth. It will also have definite negative impacts on the economic prospects of competing American workers. For example:

"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class."
"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money."
DHS "is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment."
"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers)."
"because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program."

Socioeconomic impacts, and impacts on population growth must be examined under NEPA. See, for example, City of Davis v. Coleman, 521 F.2d 661 (9th Cir. 1975). This proposed rule will induce yet more population growth. The direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of this growth must be analyzed, together with any and all socioeconomic impacts.

I am tired of the federal government implementing new methods to import cheap foreign labor. Enough already.

Sincerely,
