I strongly support this proposed rule since both the US and international students can get benefits. 

Firstly, most positions which fit STEM students are American don't like. Such us coding, programming, researching etc. It's dull and boring. But we American need someone to do it. So these international students are the best choices. 

Second, these students can get practice with their skills and knowledge they have learned in college. So that they can get a good job when they go bank their countries after OPT in the US.
