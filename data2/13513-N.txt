First of all, the fact that Homeland Security is proposing this rule change really makes my stomach turn. I thought Homeland Security was supposed to protect American citizens from potential threats; obviously, this was a false assumption! I don't think foreign students should even BE in this country; their activities are not monitored; they can simply disappear and overstay their visas; hook up with terror cells already in this country, etc. This entire OPT program is a boondoggle and needs to be disbanded, not 'enhanced." Avaricious colleges and universities just want foreign money from Saudis and other wealthy Arab states, to the detriment of American students. Unscrupulous corporations just want to hire a foreigner so they get the "bounty" and not have them contribute to the Medicare and Social Security trust funds,thus driving down American workers' wages and benefits. As far as I'm concerned, this foreign STEM system threatens Americans' livelihoods and safety. Instead of adding to the OPT program, DHS should "opt out" unless they thoroughly "vet" these foreigners, and temporarily microchip them until their visa have expired.
