I strongly support this 2 years extension. Some Americans are afraid that the extension will take out more of their own opportunities; however, companies always prefer to hire local people if they are qualified instead of hiring international students, which will take them a lot of time and also budget to finish paperwork. Companies only hire international students when they are unable to find qualified local people. What I want to emphasize is that this extension won't take away local people's opportunities, but only take opportunities that local qualified people don't wanna take. In other words, companies need those international students to work for them longer time.

What's more, STEM related jobs usually require much more time to get new employees ready for the job. If you are the CEO, are you willing to lose the employees that are just geared up to promote the development of the company?
