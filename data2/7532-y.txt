Tao Huang Strongly support the new rule!
One of the most important reason for me to choose USA as the country where I am pursuing the MS degree is the OPT. I used to hesitate which country should I go, UK or USA? And at that time, it is STEM OPT that helped me to make the decision. With totally 29 months training period combined, USA became the perfect place for me to learn more, learn better. I know most of international student thought the same way, and this leads to the global success of American academic!

For the academic field of USA, please support the new OPT rule
