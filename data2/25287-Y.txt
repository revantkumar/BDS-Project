I most strongly oppose this misguided program. Only after the current laid-off US citizen STEM employees have a job, should we consider an OPT program for non-citizens. Also I urge you to ignore the comments of the students that want to use/abuse the program and listen to the US taxpayers. Of course they are in favor of disadvantaging US citizens.
