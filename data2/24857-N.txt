It makes me angry to think that our government is considering helping foreigners like this when there are very many unemployed and underemployed U.S. Citizens. Why isn't the U.S. Government instead trying to help U.S. Citizens? Shouldn't it? Who pays the salary of U.S. Government Employees? 

How many OPT Students are there now? Are there any limits on them, both in numbers and what they are allowed to do? Can that change? Who will determine that and how? How will the public be notified? 

What is done to investigate each OPT Student before they are accepted? How is each OPT Student monitored after they are accepted? How do we know they will not use their skills to support terrorists? Who in the U.S. Government is responsible if we find out we are indeed training terrorists?

How many audits have there been on employers to protect U.S. Workers? How often are employers audited? Have there ever been any penalties on employers for failing to protect U.S. Workers, is so, what were they? How many auditors are there for employers? How thorough are they?

How many F-1 Students enroll in other academic programs? 

Has the Association of International Educators ever been audited? Why not or what were the results? 

$503.3 million dollars for this program? What is the current U.S. Budget Deficit? How much debt does the U.S. Government Owe? How much does the debt increase every day?

What happens if the Secretary of Homeland Security fails to enforce the nation's immigration laws? How does the U.S. Public know if the Secretary of Homeland Security fails to enforce the nations immigration laws?

I am opposed to this proposed rule due to the harm it will do to the U.S. Economy and also the harm it will do to U.S. Citizens.
