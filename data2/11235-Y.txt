I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S which not only provide more creative ideas and solutions all over the country

2. We all know that the America is diversity country, which was built by all kinds of people from the other side of world, and these people does contribute a lot to USA, and here is what USA is right now, we can not deny that lots of great scientists and leaders are not born in USA, but were attracted by American dream and belief, what the opponents do right now just thought for themselves, and they are certainly losers, worrying about the elimination cause only when they are afraid of losing in competition with other excellent students who acquire high level degree in American university, does they stand on the other side of OPT extension. And if you does cancel this convention I am certain USA must lose lots of excellent talented personand what's more, a lot of small company, especially in IT fields will face of much higher cost, which are what they could not afforded.

3. The lose is much higher than expected, and not only USA could not image, they also cut off an American dream road to other students, who are hard-working, intelligent, and stands out around crowding.
