I'm a STEM student working in tech company after getting my master's degree.
My manager still complaining it's difficult to find enough qualified new grad. Clearly there's no surplus of work force in STEM area.
STEM students are not allowed to work in other areas. If anyone robed citizen's jobs, please point your gun to those H1-B cheaters and illegal immigration, not OPT students. They contribute, work hard and humbly, seeking there American dream.
