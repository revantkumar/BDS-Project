I strongly support this new OPT extension rule, first of all, no matter of whether you are the US citizens or aliens, we all believe this is a country strive it to outstanding on earth because of we all hold the same faith and moral standard which is all men are created equal, we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights! the at among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. we all do know i am quoting the sentence in United Staes Declaration of Independence,one of the best-known sentences in the English Language. The history of USA is a history of immigration, no matter how hard we went through before, this country will always open the gate to any aliens around the world who just wish to works hard and try it one time in their lives. 

Secondly, I am a computer art master degree student from China, the reason i came here is i can see the future through the ideas or inventions that were originated from this land,they inspired me and keep me work harder to catch up. i met many great talented people who were not the green card holder or US citizens, but they work so well with the local guys over the computer science and art area and lead many beautiful projects that generating lots of jobs opportunities for any people in this country, let me show you an example, http://www.gamefuse.com is Chinese company called NetEase came to US and start an free to play game platform two years ago, one of my friend she is working at that company, even though she is a Chinese student but 80 percent of his colleagues is US citizens, all foreign companies or aliens came here is not to rob locals people's job, we came here for the same purpose as the locals want: happiness from self-strive,if locals and aliens work together we can create more than we used to have, that is how immigrations boost america and i believe that why here wee need STEM OPT extension to keep this country advanced in STEM areas.

Thirdly, maybe such public comment collection on website
