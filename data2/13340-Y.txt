I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It will attract more potential international student to choose study abroad in USA which provides a great deal of income for university and related industries. If they only have one-year OPT, they may choose other country instead of USA.The reason why I choose USA for my master degree is because I will have OPT and OPT Extension.

2. STEM student accept high education in USA and use OPT to work. They are legal tax payers. They make contribution to economy of USA like other USA citizens.

3. STEM related industries is very important to USA.If STEM students don't have OPT Extension, it might cause that companies cannot find suitable engineers.
