I am a US citizen tech worker who cannot find work, while very large numbers of foreign nationals have jobs I and others like me are qualified for.

What kind of country puts foreign citizens above its own?
Why are you betraying your country and fellow citizens by taking their tech job opportunities? Why are you taking hope from US citizen students who dream of having a good job in their country?
