I strongly support this rule for the following reasons.

1. International student can be great assets for companies and organizations in US. Students who have the ability to attend to US schools generally have good analytical skills and a vast diversity of backgrounds. Also, as international students, they could bring merits from their own culture in the first place.

2. US education have the best reputation in the world, but this reputation should not be restrained in classrooms, but also in professional society.

3. I personally and profoundly understand people's concern about jobs and unemployment in the current US economic environments. However, I believe that in a good economy, the employers should always be able to select the best candidates, regardless of their citizenship. Therefore, I believe it should be the employers' decision to hire or not hire a person, and the decision should be solely based on their ability.

Therefore, I strongly support the expansion of STEM OPT period and I believe this is the best for international students and for this country's future.
