I fully support this proposal.

To those who oppose it, I appreciate that you share with us your true ideas. However, before you throw out angry comments, have you ever thought why this rule ever existed?

The fact is, under current regulations, most employers would DEFINITELY hire domestic applicants as long as they are able to find them. Unfortunately, they cannot. That is why they have to hire international graduates even if they are forced to pay extra money and time. As far as I know, every one of my domestic fellow students have decent jobs after graduation, many of which are never available to foreign nationals.

Go figure.
