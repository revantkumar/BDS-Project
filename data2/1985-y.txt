Harry Cheung We strive to attract more students around the world to our colleges. That way, we make affordable higher education for U.S. citizens. Our main competitors include colleges in Britain, Europe, Canada and Australia. OPT extension is one of the most important perks that let us stand out. OPT is clearly a great idea as part of the whole college education process for international student.

If we want to keep attracting international students and lower our education costs, we should adopt the new OPT extension.
