American workers and american industry manufacturing and trade exportation(rather than unnecessary importation) helped build this country into the world power, leader and trendsetter that it once was. Sadly we are seeing a huge movement to the contrary ,intentional I believe, that was,is ,and will continue to hurt and ultimately dismantle this county's independence indefinitely and permanently. Stop the madness! Do you suppose this will work to your own advantage?Your sadly mistaken, and when reality finally kicks in, it will be too late to stop the slide down the slippery slope you( and ultimately, we all) are on!

Please, Please, Hire American, Buy American, and Preserve America!

Thank you, 

urgently,
