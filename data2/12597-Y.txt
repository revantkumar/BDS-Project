I totally support this proposed rule of extending OPT extension to 24 months. That way, STEM student will have longer time to work in the U.S and make much larger contributions to this country. 

First, the U.S, in order to develop economy, needs large amounts of people with STEM background, and merely hiring U.S citizens or permanent residents are far from enough: there are still large gaps needed to be filled. The foreign student are just the right person to do this. 

Second, these highly educated people are precious resources to the U.S. Foreign student who can achieve STEM degree in U.S are all excellent in their own countries. If OPT EXTENSION is extended, they will have more chances to stay here and make more contributions to America. The U.S only spends couple of years to nurture them, but they bring back much more value.

Third, they are very diligent. It's hard for STEM students to compete with citizens, so they must be more sedulous and much less picky about jobs. That makes them spare no effort to provide high quality work to make sure they stay in the companies. 

Finally, they will not threat the chances of citizens. The economy of the U.S is recovering and the need for work force in STEM major is larger than citizen. And OPT EXTENSION only includes STEM majors, the citizens concentrates more on majors like literature, economy, art, etc. So foreign student will only be a great supplement to the need. 

In sum, I am positive this proposal will benefit the U.S not just in short term but strategically in long run. Thank you for reading!
