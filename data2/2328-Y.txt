I strongly SUPPORT this ruling.

In the last 6 years we have already seen a tremendous growth for international students and the US market has get a great share for the economy boost by those foreign consumption. If we cancel the OPT, students are very likely to flood to other countries such as Australia and Canada. OPT extension is directly affecting 50 thousands students but canceling it may affect millions' students decision.

Also we could see the contribution by those STEM opt students. As a professor I could feel that very few American students are taking graduate level classes and do research. I can't find a reason why we need to drive them back and can't work for us. I don't think the US should suffer such a great loss in intelligence.
