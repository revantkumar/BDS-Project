Cynthia Wong For the past decades, OPT STEM workers contributed a lot of growth to the American economy. If America lost OPT STEM workers, it would be just a matter of time before USA becomes another mediocre country like the United Kingdom. British government have strict rules for foreign students and can you name some of famous British IT companies??? No! Most famous IT companies are from USA and a lot of them are foreign born tech workers! They are hardworking and talented. OPT STEM students are DIFFERENT from illegal immigrants! This is a common sense. It's so sad that some people equal OPT STEM students to illegal immigrants. Without OPT STEM extension, I can foresee that very soon the USA economy will sluggish, American citizens lose jobs, and social problems arises. 

APPROVE the OPT-extension!!
