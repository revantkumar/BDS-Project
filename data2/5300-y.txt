Zibin Fan America is an opening country for any people who has a hopeful dream and want to realize it. Many students study here and then want to do practical work after graduation. They do lots of practice and get experience here. They are doing good changes to the world, which makes The U.S stronger. OPT extension for F-1 Non-immigrant Student with STEM Degree really does good for both the students and The U.S. A friend of mine who has ever got a degree in the U.S and now he is working in China. He said working experience after graduation in America really matters.
