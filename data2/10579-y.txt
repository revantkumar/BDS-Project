Castiello Shane The extension of OPT for STEM degrees is very important for US and her citizen, therefore I strongly stand for the proposed rule.

US has been and will be a country encouraging people from all over the world to pursue their American dream and enjoy freedom and liberty in this nation. The benefits of this to the national interests are also obvious, of which the founders, lawmakers and most of her citizen of this nation have been aware, that in order to keep US on the leadership and top-class position in every field, she needs the world top class people from all over the world. The F-1 students with STEM degree are a great source of them. They usually were in the top ranks before they came to US and most of them obtained an advanced degree and achieved a lots of accomplishment before they graduated. They are the highly skilled people that US firms and institution looking for. When granting them the extension of OPT, they will have longer time and chance to use their skills and intelligence to serve their employers, hens the US. Some argued that if we eliminate the OPT, they will be more jobs for citizen. This is not true. Based on my experience working in high tech companies, every year, they have to hire people from abroad to fulfill certain positions because they can't find the right person in US. This is hard to say but it is the education system we should blamed rather than the DHS for the lack of competitive skills of some of citizens. If we eliminate the extension of OPT, there will be more such open positions that companies has to look for oversee candidates, which will dramatically increase the costs. One has to understand that OPT is not working visa nor a green card, it is a efficient and economic way to get the best human resources to use in those fields. US companies should not hire people who are not eligible for a certain position.
