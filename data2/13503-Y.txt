I hold tons of supports for this proposal as an HR in Amazon. It is a wise proposal with millions to win but nothing to lose. The general economy of U.S. will receive infinite benefits from that while at the meantime, the native employees in the U.S. won't be affected at all. 

Everyone knows U.S. is a country of technology giants in the global. The underlying reason is that its tradition of incorporating diversity around the global. But there are big problems awaiting for US economy, the technology companies are suffering from hiring staff in STEM fields to contribute to U.S. economy. 

According to the statistics from the Forbes(http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2015/06/19/the-companies-with-the-most-stem-job-openings-right-now-2/), there are a great number of technology companies in need of STEM employees among which the AMAZON has 2391 job opens this year, approximately double of the company in the same rank in 2013. Obviously, the job market are requiring a large number students in STEM areas. 

The great vacancies are far from being compensated by native employees since the demand is much larger the supply. Obviously, technology companies give no priority to international students in recruitment. Rather, international students have to pay more efforts in the job market and they work harder with distinguished academic performances. Technology companies are in urgent need for these brilliant people to make a joint efforts with local geniuses for accelerating the pace of economic increase.

The OPT extension will give us companies a larger pool of choices from students on campus. Also, it greatly save our time and efforts in matching the right person with our positions. Otherwise, we are going to suffer from having to put off projects and stop make brilliant products for social well-beings enhancement just because international great minds are discriminated in the job market.
