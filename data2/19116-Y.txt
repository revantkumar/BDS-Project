Extending STEM OPT will be best decision U.S. makes for itself. Looking at the recent 30 years of the country's development, technology has been the major driving force. A sad fact is that domestic American students generally do not like learning STEM subjects. On the contrary, a huge portion of international students are learning STEM and are DOING GREAT. 

Maybe 10 years ago, we do not need that much of foreign tech work force since we do not have too many technology companies. However, the recently start-up and venture capital boom are creating a large amount of more tech companies, which require an enormous amount of eligible tech workers. Domestic graduates alone can definitely not satisfy those tech companies' needs. If we do not extend STEM OPT, we are limiting our potential to develop further into a stronger nation. 

In regards to "foreigners competing for our jobs," all I want to say is that on the level of STEM work, there is no enough American work force now. The demand for tech workers is way larger than American STEM graduates; we need to fill that gap with foreign work force. Or we will slow our own development.

In conclusion, it is to our greatest benefit to extend OPT for STEM majors.
