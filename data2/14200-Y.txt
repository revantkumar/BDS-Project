I don't think international students who are on OPT or OPT STEM extension status are stealing our job. We should pay attention to the illegal immigrants and cheap labors holding H1-B visa brought by ICC (Indian Consultant Company). They are actually the people who steal from us; they occupied most of the annual quota of H1-B visa, they are paid way much less than the average standard, and they don't even have a US degree!

Take some time, you simply google "foreign h1-b overuse", tons of results will show up: Disney, Southern California Edison, etc. I hope I made a clear point in here, for most of you to see.
