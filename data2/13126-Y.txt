I would definitely support this new regulation proposed here since it will stop the happening of brain drain to the companies as well as would inhibit closure of small firms. Thus, maintaining/developing the North America economy. The most important thing along with the economy is the international relations which will remain at the best level once this regulation is passed contributing to the global peace as whole.
