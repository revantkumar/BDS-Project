I STRONGLY SUPPORT this rule.

From my personal view, I am just an international student with OPT extension. I would like to argue that we pay absolutely more than citizen in finding a job. The reason why we struggling in this is we know that USA is the place u can create your own dreams, not like my home country, with lots of corruption and bureaucracy. OPT is actually the first step for me to get educated and contribute to this country. Pls keep this rule to be 24 months.
