I support this rule.

Many international students, especially PhD students are founded by the US government for years to get they diploma. It would be good investment to get the well-educated people stay and work for the US. However, it would be a big waste of money if they had to leave the country and serve others for merely not having the VISA.

It may take more than one year for someone to finally find the right job and glow, and for the employer to discover employee's ability. OPT extension is a appropriate way to keep the human resource and select the elites from international students. 

Many countries offer great opportunity (salary, funding, housing, etc) for the well-educated group to come back from the US and work in their home country. The US would face a great loss in science, technology and finance without OPT extension.
