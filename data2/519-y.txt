Yisong Wu I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

OPT extension is the reason why I came to US and studied in Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, I could choose my other offers such as Hong Kong University in China and University of Sheffield in UK, which is cheaper and closer to my hometown. I believe Learning and practicing is the best way to absorb knowledge and motivate innovation. One year OPT is definitely not enough for applying what we learned at school, neither to contribute a lot in the work since a single project usually last for two or more years (from my current working experience in US IT company). Without OPT extension, US companies cannot benefit from foreign students as they can right now and also foreign students cannot apply their skills and innovation to US companies. The failure of this rule from my point of view is a double lose.
