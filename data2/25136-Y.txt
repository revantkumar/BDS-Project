From my point of view I think this is a really good rule that can help not only the US company to pay more tax to the government, but also since more foreign STEM students are hired, more tax they will pay to the government.

Secondly, if this expanding is stopped, a lot more unemployment will coming to the government because the company will bankrupt.
