Harshit Shah As an immigrant student, I strongly support the proposed changes to STEM OPT regulations. The reasons are as follows:

With just 12 months of OPT, there won't be much motivation for an international student to come the United States to pursue higher education in the field of STEM, because it restricts the opportunities an individual can have to give back to the US economy. 

As per the Open Doors report for 2013-2014, there was 6% increase in the numbers of international students coming to United States for graduate studies, from the previous academic year. This resulted in an increase of $3 billion contributions to the economy of US, totaling to $27 billion from international students.

Of the 886,052 international students that came to US in the academic year 2013-2014, 574,129 (64.7%) of the students had personal or family funding. It means that most of the funds that US Government allocates for scholarships goes to US citizen students, which motivates US resident students to pursue higher education.

If the number of international students coming to US for graduate studies decline because of no STEM extension, then it would result in a drastic fall in the revenue the US Education Industry produce each year.
