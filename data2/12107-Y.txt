I support opt extension. 
There are lots of F1 student with opt devote themselves in high tech area in United States, OPT is important for them. Since they are one of the main stream contributing to the IT area prospers the industrial and economy, it's difficult to image what will happen if the opt extension being cancelled. Qualified candidates are difficult to find, and one of the most important area to economy will suffer a lot. 
Thus, OPT extension is both important to these F1 student as well as United States.
