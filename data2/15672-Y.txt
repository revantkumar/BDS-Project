I'm also a STEM student who's using OPT extension now, yet still find it hard to work without worrying the future, because time is so limited. I'm not earning a low salary to do some easy jobs that everybody else can do. I've been studying hard at graduate school for my master degree in engineering just to be capable of this position, and have been working even harder to contribute to my company.
To be an engineer is not easy, because one always has to learn a lot before he really mater it. Apparently, 2 years is just a beginning, that what my team leader, a 30-year-experienced engineer said.However, it is considerably possible that I couldn't get my working visa before my OPT extension expires, and get kicked out of the country, just before I could make significantly more contributions to the society and the U.S. economy. And it's not just me, tens of thousands of STEM student out there are all facing this awkward situation.
So, sincerely, I hereby ask for your consideration for this expansion. This means a lot to us STEM students as well as the U.S. economy and the lead position of technology innovations around the world.
