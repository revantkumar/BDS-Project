I am in favor of this regulation on OPT STEM. The reason is that it will attract the best talents from around the world to the nation, and enhance every part of America's development. That is why America is still the strongest country in the world, and helping the world to be a better place. 

On the other hand, the regulation is clearly NOT going to undermine the native Americans' working opportunities, because the whole point of this regulation is NOT about to open more job opportunities to aliens, but to create a more rigorous oversight on the OPT STEM implementation process, to make sure only the most talented ones can benefit from this regulation.

All in all, I am absolutely in favor of this regulation
