I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I was a student once and I have contributed my knowledge, experience and hard work to the economy through working in multiple companies. Without STEM Extension opportunity, I would not have taken the risk of coming here considering US education very costly for any international student coming to US. I strongly believe this increased period of practical training is important for best and the brightest students students to fully develop their skills, find employment opportunities, contribute to the economy. It is not only good for the students but also for the companies to find skills more easily.
