David Cheng I strongly SUPPORT the extension of the OPT.

I am an employee in an IT company in the US. As I notice, there are so many people from foreign countries are contributing to this company and make new products everyday. Most of these people get their Ph.D or Mater degree in US, and find the job within their OPT time. Without these people, I cannot imagine what will happen to this company. Probably it cannot survive within a day...

Many people complain that extension of OPT will occupy the jobs for the US citizens. I think this is ridiculous, There are so many companies in the US are hiring the students from STEM. Every year, these new people will start their new work and continue the leadership of the US in the IT field. Can the US citizens fill this gap? We can't ask all the US people to learn programing, or ask all the people to become the scientist. If the OPT extension is canceled, that means a lot of people from STEM will have to go back to their home country and support their countries. I don't really think the US can still lead the whole world in many areas.
