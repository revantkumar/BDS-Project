Bo Chen United States is an immigration country. The reason why it becomes the no.1 super power country is because the technology it owns. And international students play a very important role on it. Without them, high technology companies like google and face book will lost their competition and so as United states.

Some says those international stem students are stealing jobs from native americans. That is totally wrong, because those students are not only consume resource but also building wealth for their companies and more wealth more job opportunities. And native american can also make benefit on it.
