I strong support for this and I believe extend the opt for stem degrees is good for our country. Many fields, especially in Computer Science, almost all the students are from China or India, if we don't let them work in U.S, how about our technical companies' future? Such as google, apple, Microsoft, they need students work for them. American is the most powerful country in the world, not because of restriction, but because of freedom. We must abandon the view that all the workers must from US, if we do like this, America will fall!
