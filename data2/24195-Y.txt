Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed huge growth to the US economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen. Without foreign workers, USA economy will stagnate, companies will lose a lot of talented workers, and social problems arises. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.
