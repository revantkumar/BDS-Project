Ted White This OPT is just more evidence of the attack on the American worker. These STEM workers have gone to school, at some expense, both in time and money, and worked and succeeded and OUR government is allowing the U.S. employer to import discount labor and subsidizing this corporate outrage. I am totally against allowing any additional work visas of any kind. I hope this is clear. Sincerely, Ted A. White
