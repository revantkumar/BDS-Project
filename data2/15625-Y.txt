I am here to support this extension based on the following reason:
1. OPT extension can fully stimulate the American economy and attract more worldwide talented coming to U.S.
2. OPT extension can reduce the cost of hiring for employers. 
3. OPT extension can have foreign students practice themselves in the real world after graduation.
