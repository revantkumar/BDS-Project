The STEM extension is critical for companies to keep a sustained workforce, especially for the high-tech industry. The 12-month OPT is too short, which makes it difficult for companies to keep their foreign workforce, especially considering the current condition of H1B visa. Hiring the most talented minds is the key to keep American companies competitive in a global economy. 

The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has pointed out that "economic projections point to a need for approximately 1 million more STEM professionals than the U.S. will produce" (https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-executive-report-final_2-13-12.pdf). Therefore, it is important for American companies to be able to hire highly educated foreign workers in the STEM fields in order to keep the current economic growth. The STEM extension also provides a valuable opportunity for F1 students to develop practical skills in a working environment.

The STEM extension is extremely beneficial to US economy and students, therefore, I strongly support the proposal.
