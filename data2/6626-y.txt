Thomas Puglia Dear Sir or Madam,

This another scheme or artifice to cheat Americans out of jobs.
It is another source of cheap labor, will depress wages, and again confirm that the current administration in Washington could care less for American families
The only time Americans are important is when the bills come due and The Executive Branch could care Less about anyone other than themselves 
The indifference to the impact this proposal and Unconstitutional Executive Orders have is appalling

Good Day,

Tom Puglia
