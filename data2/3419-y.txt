1. A lot of the students who can benefit from this rule have advanced technology degrees, like Masters or PhDs. These students can apply their expertise to a lot of advanced technology industry in the US, thus greatly speeding up the improvement of the technology of US.
2. Making nonimmigrant students work for the US is actually creating more job opportunities for US citizens, since nonimmigrant students can bring the advancement of technologies and the improvement of economy with their expertise in high-tech, which will result in more positions being created for US citizens.
3. If these highly talented students are forced to work for other countries because of the immigration rules, it will benefit the competitors.
4. US cannot be successfully without the contributions of millions of talented immigrants. The future success of the US also depends on rules that can retain talented immigrants.
