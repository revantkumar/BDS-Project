This is a ridiculous and unneeded regulation. In fact it is a slap in the face for American STEM workers that are out of work or not fully employed in their field or study as well as an insult and a roadblock against American STEM students who are already out of school and unemployed or who are working to achieve work in this field after graduating.
It is my understanding that about 50% of American STEM graduates cannot find suitable work already. Where is there the slightest need for a SINGLE unneeded and unwanted foreign student or worker in this field?
Trash can this stupid idea.
