I strongly support extending the OPT for STEM students. This is a great way to attract talents all over the world. With 3 years of OPT for STEM program, more students with an interest and specialty in science and technology world wide would be willing to come to U.S. to pursue higher eduction, which can drive the U.S. economy, and to work in the U.S. for 3 years after their graduation, which can help to advance the high technology sector. Take a look at Google, Amazon and many other technology related field, more than half of their employees are international. These international talents, relied on the OPT extension, will make everyone's life much convenient, boost U.S. economy. Therefore it makes sense to extend OPT.
