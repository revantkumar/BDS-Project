America needs to take care of its citizens not foreign students here on a visa for education. And give companies incentives to hire foreign students over its own citizens is beyond belief. We need to take our country back!!! And take care of our citizens first and foremost!!! There are too many americans that have lost everything due to President OBama's cut back . I have a number of friends that was employed at the Kennedy Space Center which have yet to find a job. Thanks to our fine Pres. closing the Space program down. And most of them are also veterans. So America needs to open their eyes and get priorities straight!!
