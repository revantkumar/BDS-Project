I strongly support this rule.It will help the STEM students to earn more practical knowledge in the the field of their studies and help the industry to nurture innovative ideas brought by those students. I believe those students, who are trained in US universities, with their skill-set, innovation and training will contribute to support the USA's position as a leader in technology and innovation.
