I strongly support this. As an international student, I choose to pursue a master's degree in the U.S. only because of the OPT. I believe the education and working experience obtained in the U.S. will improve my competitiveness over other candidates when applying for a job in my home country. 
If the OPT is only 1 year, its attraction is largely reduced. It's not worth the huge amount of money I paid for my tuition, and I'd rather spend the money in other countries like Canada.
