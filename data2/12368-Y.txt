I strongly support OPT extension because F1 nonimmigrant students STEM degree who stay in the US are making more contributions to the US economy other than taking away jobs from americans since the massive job opportunities in STEM areas can not be fulfilled by americans. The lacking of appropriate workers with STEM degree will retard the development of these industries.
