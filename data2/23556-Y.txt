I think people who against the OPT or OPT extension are lacking foresight. It is true that there are significant number of non-citizens working in the high-tech industry and academic. The reason is that these companies and schools cannot find enough citizens to fill up these positions. Many of the positions in these high-tech industry require professional trainings such as a masters and PhDs degree, and there is no enough graduates each year in the US. Most of the hiring managers and recruiters will certainly consider the US citizens first if they have the same skills with international students, because they dont need support for immigration visa. Maybe what we should blame is why we do not encourage more students in the high school to go into the STEM majors. Some people argue that these international students create intense competition for jobs in the US, which is certainly not the case. Most of international students are talented peoples who hold a Masters and PhD degrees. They have contributed significantly to the development of IT and Bio-tech, and create tremendous jobs in the US. 
Some also blame these international students for preventing the raise of minimum wages, which is ridiculous. The average wages of these international students is two to three times higher than the minimum wages. Around 27% of their incomes are going to the Federal and state each year, and benefit each US citizens. 
Indeed, we need the OPT to retain more talented international students.
