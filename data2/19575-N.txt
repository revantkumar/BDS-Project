I am writing in regard to the Optional Practical Training Program and want to voice my concerns. The Original intent of the OPT Program was to give foreign students tools that would help their home countries when they returned home, however this program today is being used by these students as a bridge to remain in the U.S. Employers are also using the OPT Program to get around the H 1-B cap. The DHS proposal runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT Program.

There is already an extremely excessive number of foreign students in the OPT program and it increases yearly. Employers are given incentives to hire them and this undermines the opportunities for American STEM workers.

Also, employers do not pay FICA or Medicare taxes on the OPT Students and these same students are holding jobs in the$60,000-90,000 a year range and they cost the US Taxpayers about $1 Billion a year. This is preposterous.

On a variety of measures former foreign students have equal, and many times lesser talents than their American peers. This is unfair to Americans. If the US needs foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do they need to be trained? And if special training is given to them, why can't this special training be given to American's instead?

DHS frequently defines recent college graduates as students which allows the student and the employer to be free from payroll taxes thus penalizing Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly and this affects our elders indirectly.

Jobs should be given to American workers first and foremost. We must take care of our own and give our people every benefit available to get American's working again. Unemployment is rampant in America and this shouldn't be.

Respectfully,
