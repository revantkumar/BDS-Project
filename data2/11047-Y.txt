I support the STEM OPT extension proposal. The job opportunities of native Americans are minimally affected by the foreign students. The fear that they are stealing jobs from US citizens is illusional. There was not a single native STEM college student I know of couldn't find a job because the jobs were taken by the foreigners. 
Meanwhile, many US companies suffer from insufficient qualified STEM job candidates. The STEM OPT extension makes it much easier for talented global students to work for the tech companies and research institutes, thus strengthening the leading place of United States on scientific research, information technologies, and many industries, while facing with competitions from rising countries like China and India. 
Highly educated scientists, engineers and technological experts are the driving force for the vitality and success of an economy. It is therefore very unwise to expel them as if they are thieves. The STEM OPT extension is one step forward for choosing diversity over discrimination, prosperity over retrogress. There is no good reason to reject a proposal like this which, in the long term, benefits so much for the United States and everyone living in.
