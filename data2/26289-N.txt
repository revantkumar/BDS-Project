What are you thinking? This proposed rule will displace America tech workers with foreigners, at a time when we have a record number of people not in the work force, and this is madness. On top of that, under this rule, they will not be not paying taxes, which will reduce federal tax revenue and place more of a burden on American citizens. Why do you want to do this? Our economy is not in great shape as it is and the middle class is suffering. Families have LOST $5,000 in income since 2008. Why why why???????
