This proposed rule is great for both the F-1 students and the U.S. people. I strongly support this rule.

First, many F-1 student with STEM degrees graduated from prestige colleges and some of them have advanced degrees. If they must leave U.S. because they don't have any choice, it would be a waste of the educational resource of U.S.

Second, many F-1 students run startups. In the world today innovation is the most important thing for sustainable growth of the economy, and well-educated F-1 students can help the U.S. people make innovations. And they hire U.S. people too!
