Improving and Expanding the OPT program is THE most important driver of the long-term U.S economic growth and the improvement of U.S. social welfare.

Let's break down the U.S GDP by sectors (Data of year 2010, year 2012, data source: BEA and WSJ. Please refer to the attachments). For U.S. total GDP, 11.9% came from Education and Health Care, 19.6% from Government, 12.9% from Real estate and rental and leasing, 6.6% from Durable goods manufacturing, 6.0% from non-durable manufacturing, 8.3% from retail and wholesale trade, and 10.2% from Arts & Entertainment, Construction and Transportation. All above sectors contributed a WHOLE 63.6% of US Economy. At the same time, all these foreign students majoring in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) are the customers, instead of competitors for employees of these industries. THEY CREATED DEMAND. AND THE DEMAND THEY CREATED GIVE US WORKERS JOB OPPORTUNITIES. 

On the other hand, in the industries where these foreign STEM kids tend to find jobs, such as Information Technology, Finance, and Research Institutes. All the Americans who are CAPABLE of doing the same job can find full-time jobs much easier than these foreign kids. (You don't want to hire international students for the uncertainty related to the visa issue if you were an employer, as long as there was an American kid who was able to do the same thing.) However, companies still hire international kids just because of AMERICAN WORKERS ARE INCAPABLE OF DOING THE HIGH-TECH jobs. THESE FOREIGN TALENTS ARE NOT COMPETITORS OF AMERICAN WORKERS! LET THEM STAY HERE, EVEN OFFERING GREENCARDS AND CITIZENSHIP IS THE KEY TO MAINTAIN THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF THE USA IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND SOCIAL WELFARE. Just imagine what will happen to the U.S if all these super smart talents are sent back to China, Russia and India. Where should we place our hope in the future of U.S.? In the undereducated, obese, heavy-manual labor workers? Bye-by
