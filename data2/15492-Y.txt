I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Students can apply what the have learned in U.S. to help U.S. economy. 
2. Many pioneers in all sorts of field are at first international students. 
3. Diversity/competition is the key to a vivid and active economic system. International students are the major force.
