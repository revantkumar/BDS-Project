I totally agrees with this new rules because it really gains much advantages to US economy. 

As we all know, most STEM students and professors in our universities are from foreign countries such as China and India. So if we do not pass rules like this to motivate them, it is highly possible that they will stop coming to our countries. Most private universities will lose a huge amount of income. What is worse, people who make a living by these foreign students such as apartment managers, landlords and traders near these universities will also lose their jobs. If many people near universities lose their jobs, the safety around these universities will become very bad. Criminals such as gun shooting will booming and this may do a great harm to US citizens' who are study and living in university campus.
