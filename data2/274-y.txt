Chao Qi In the past decades, nonimmigrant STEM students have contributed a lot in various high-tech companies in the United States,e.g., chemists from pharmaceutical companies, software engineers from IT companies. By approving this extension proposal, nonimmigrant STEM students would have the chance to keep pursuing their career goal in United States just like past several years. 
Not like a few people who are against this proposal said this proposal will take jobs out of local american people, these STEM students equipped with scientific knowledge and technological skills will not be the majority in the job market to compete with people who hold the citizenship or green card. Because these students is just a tiny portion of the population seeking jobs in the whole US job market every year.
On the other hand, the proposal will meet the trend of ongoing scientific revolution which science and technology is the new productivity of a country. By making this proposal into effect, nonimmigrant STEM students can have a chance to become employee of high-tech companies in US to boost the economy growth.
