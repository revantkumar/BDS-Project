This is about equal work opportunity rule. Restricting international students with STEM degrees to work in US is not a good action to improve the competition among young people. We are all educated in the universities, we sit in the same classroom and do the same homework, but international students have to bear such a huge pressure for job hunting, even they are smarter than a great portion of Americans! Young Americans will become lazy and noncompetitive because of the unequal work rule. In one word, diversity is the key to make US in front of the technology and stay the top for a longer time.
