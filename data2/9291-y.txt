Emil Collier I strongly support this new ruling.
OPT program is directly related to US educational institutions and is fundamentally a selling point of the US educational market. A lot of people come to the US rather than go to other countries because of this benefit. If the extension was canceled, then it would be a threat to the US educational institutions financially. No one would ever want to bring CASH to the country anymore in exchange of education. The extension, to some degree, is a basic sales strategy that has worked well. 
If students who are studying in the US all go back to their country after 1years of training, they will soon create value for their countries that will one day compete with the US companies. The US uses its own education to nurture its competitors?
