As an ongoing STEM PhD student, I strongly appeal that the OPT 24 months extension program can be passed. From my personal perspective, this would mean an avoidance of the potentially painful struggle to get H1B status in a short 12 months, a longer period of time to find a quality position that matches my skill and realize my value, and a better chance of using my knowledge and expertise gathered through the 4-5 PhD years to create value to U.S. society.

Such an extension will undoubtedly benefit the U.S. society as well, boost its competence in science and technology in the global market, increase its creativity to get better chance of solving the difficult problems that we're faced right now. I can't understand in what sense can a 24 months OPT extension program hurt anyone, endanger the employment of any worker. Even though on the surface it seems that more international PhD students stay would mean more competition to domestic workers, the truth is that the small number of PhD workforce can propel the advance of technology, create new types of employment to the whole U.S. society. 

I was drawn to U.S. by American Dream, by intelligence and hard working, everybody can realize his/her dream. My dream of making achievements in my field has just get started, and I don't want to get poured cold water by the shrank OPT period. I definitely believed that the U.S. government has the insight to appreciate the value of international STEM students, to put the development of science and technology above of complaint from the stagnant social inertia.
