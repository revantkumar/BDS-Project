Weian Liu As an international student, i totally support this proposal. First of all, it perfectly translates two important components of American Spirit, namely fairness and justice. We were crossing oceans and seas to arrive at America with an aim to contribute our effort to develop this great country and also pursue our American dream. Allowing us to legally work in the states for a longer time is the first crucial step, and truly make this possible.

Secondly, this proposal helps to attract more talented students over the world to the US, which in turn will benefit the US in the long term. As the President Obama mentioned a while ago that the US is going to revitalize the manufacturing sector. There is no doubt that international students in the STEM field could greatly contribute it. Therefore, it is an important initiative.

Third, domestic employees should not worry about the job-fighting or loosing jobs. Extending OPT period does not guarantee permanent residency. Therefore, domestic employees still have more advantages during job hunting than internationals since they do not need sponsorship. And it is an important consideration from employer perspective.

Therefore, i think the successful implementation of this proposal will truly bring more prosperity to the US.
