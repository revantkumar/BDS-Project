12 months for foreign students to gain experience here in the USA is extremely generous. There is no need to extend that time period. We need to promote OUR young students, citizens of this country, to fill the job openings that are available. F-1 students need to go back to their respective countries and put into use the things they have learned, while here as a guest in our country, and let OUR children take the jobs that they deserve as citizens of the United States of America.
