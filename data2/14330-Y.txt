I think it is right to offer the 24 months opt extension to STEM student.

U.S. can benifit from this extension. High tech companies can have enough time to hire a STEM studen and evalue the performance. Some person may argue that hiring STEM student can hurt domestic employee's job opportunities. Well, I would said it is the outsourcing companies hurt. This companies hire low skill cheap oversea workers, who have never received high education from an US college.If you doubt, please check the H1B file data. Most of quota are used by oversea hiring. The really bad things, the outsourcing companies make faked documents and file multiple times for a position in order to get a higher chance when the immigration department start lottery the H1B.
