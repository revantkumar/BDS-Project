Ziheng He This country was built by immigrants. No illegal immigrats? I can't agree more. But not allowing people to work here? How will you explain American Dream to your children? Pass the STEM OPT extension. We're not here to steal jobs, we earn them. If Americans don't fit the jobs in this country, thats the problem for the education system in the US. Its not foreigners' problem.
