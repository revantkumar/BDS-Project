I strongly support the extension for OPT session, and the reason are following. 

First, the United States is a immigrant country, and each year government offers millions different type of visa to different group of people include refugee and people who seek to political asylum, and we call them " protecting people's right" however, as an international student we also need government to protect our right. Imagine you graduate and you only have one year to look for job and get sponsored, most of the time you will not have a full year OPT time period, what that means in less than a year you have to find a job which agree to sponsor you, however if your EAD card has delayed, you probably only have nine months to do so, tell me which employ will put somebody in a management program who can only work for them for nine months, you may say then ask for a h1b, this is funny, as we all know, employ has to cover all the expense for h1b, plus not many employ qualify for applying h1b, plus they only have certain number each year for h1b, how about if you not graduate in a right time, and the employ has already filled out all the numbers for h1b, or how about if you only have nine months or less how could you compete to the people who has more than three months at least than you? So extend OPT session is just a way to give international student an opportunity to be a little bit more equal to local America, as well as a little bit more time to get ready for next step. People who are seeking OPT are the people who has already gained a value degree in this country, I don't understand why government been so difficulty to them since they are young and fixed tax payer.
