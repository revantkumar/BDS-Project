Neema Megalmani I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
Also, I would like to mention monitoring of students using the OPT (incase of misuse) and support employers in keeping their valuable employees.
