Jess Erwin, Providence Advisors LLC Not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes.

A 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.

The DHS's plan encourages US companies to fire US citizen workers and replace them with foreign-born workers and/or not to hire US workers in the first place and has the causal effect of wage suppression in the STEM job marketplace. The intended program is costly and ill-conceived at a time when creating jobs and encouraging US companies to hire US citizens should be the paramount concern.
