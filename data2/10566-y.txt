Rita Lee I support the OPT extension. I don't know why people are against this.
I am a software developer. I know many Indian and Chinese developers who are doing extremely good job in this field. They are treasures of the companies. But many of them are facing the problem of failing to get H1B visa within one year. If they dob't have a longer OPT they will have to leave the country which is actually a loss to the company and the country. With an extension of OPT, they will have more chances to win in the H1B draw lots and be able to contribute to the companies more.
People say we are receiving high salaries and we should give the high-salary-working opportunity to US citizens. But the truth is working in STEM field is not so easy. The work can be very tiring and high demanding. Just see how many software developers are balding. There is reason why we are high-paid. I don't think if we reject all the foreign engineers we can still find enough US citizens to satisfy the need of all the tech companies.
Besides, I don't see any relation between OPT extension and illegal immigrant. With F1 visa, OPT and H1B visa, they are all legal to stay in America.
The joining of genius from all over the world will definitely bring more energy to America and improve our competitiveness. Let's be open minded and do the extension!
