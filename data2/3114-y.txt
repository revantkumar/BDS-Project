Janessa Ravenwood As a STEM worker and a U.S. citizen, I believe strongly that U.S. citizen STEM workers should be supported over non-citizen ones. The situation over the employment of U.S. citizen STEM workers continues to deteriorate year after year, as employers continually try to replace us with cheaper foreign labor.

The Optional Practical Training (OPT) already gives employers substantial financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans, and has, in fact, done quite a bit of damage to our employability already. I thus urge you to please NOT expand this program. Indeed, its present form should actually be curtailed so that there are fewer unemployed U.S. citizen STEM workers.

Thank You,
