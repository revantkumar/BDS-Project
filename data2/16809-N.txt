The Optional Prcatical Training program hurts American teck workers.
US Companies should be hiring American workers , not foreignors. This is wrong, but the American people knows this is all about more money for these companies by using foreignors that will work for less.
Plus Congress has not approved this, just our radical, "destroy America" President.
Do not allow this to happen!
