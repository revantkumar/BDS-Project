Adeolu Morawo As a medical graduate from Africa, I have had the chance through OPT after graduate school to participate in clinical research as a Postdoc. The experience I am gaining will be invaluable and translatable when I return to my country. Imagine if we don't have to beg America for Ebola vaccine, but rather collaborate with her to make the world a safer and richer place. 

By giving nonimmigrant students the chance for practical training, the US would have indeed offered real help to the developing world. We don't want the fish, we want to know how to fish. It makes for a better world down the line when highly trained and experienced people can lift their home countries while contributing to the wealth and knowledge of the land of their sojourn. This is only possible through practical training of bright young minds beyond the confines of school. Please give us a chance.
