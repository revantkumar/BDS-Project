I support this proposal for the following reason:
The extension of OPT for STEM Degrees would bring higher economic freedom to the labor market of the US, which would be helpful to correct distortion in the labor market and thus improve the overall efficiency of labor market. This proposal once enact, would attract more talent people to the US labor market, and push the labor market closer to an efficient equilibrium. This would be helpful in improving the average productivity while bringing positive externalities to the society, and thus in long term, benefit the US citizens instead of hurt them. Moreover, this proposal aims to expand the degree of openness of the market, which aligns with the American spirit of a free country.
