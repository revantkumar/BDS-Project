I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule. Currently there are over 400000 STEM students studying in U.S. either in a 2 years master degree or in a 4 years undergraduate degree. I myself graduated from my 6-year PhD in U.S. and do need a training period, longer than one year, to help me transit from academia to industry. From what I know, international students come to US not only because of good education quality but also practical training experience such as CPT and OPT STEM. Silicon Valley companies here do benefit from innovation ideas and academia cutting-edge algorithms we PhDs provide. No need to say, if this new rule fails, it would be a huge economic loss for tech companies, and even educational organizations.
