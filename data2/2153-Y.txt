Strongly support!

The new extension policy has a more strict regulation on both sides of employers and employees, which make this policy itself no harm to the united states economy as well as the competition between american and foreigners.

Not to mention that it's already been really difficult for STEM graduates without citizenship to find a full-time job (except students with Computer science/ computer engineering major). Only outstanding foreign graduates stand are able to do so. Why not giving these kids more time to contribute their talent to the field they have great expertise? 

The OPT extension should exist with no doubt. The discussion should be led to "how strictly regulated policy should be made to ensure only highly-talented foreign graduates under reliable employers can go through this 2-yr extension?" And obviously the amended policy released recently successfully define this question! Well-done!
