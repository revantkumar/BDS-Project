Tom Trice I strong support the proposal by following reasons,

1. STEM students are all in science majors,the statistical data shows that most Americans did not like to learn science which consider much harder then other area. which lead U.S. need more immigration are talented in STEM majors to support the country.

2. Everybody should be known that U.S. has not been as great as before. Why? because we still depends on World War II's advantage resource and did not follow the steps with the world. why U.S. has a wonderful history? because everybody in this country 200 years ago were immigration. New knowledgeable immigration always bring the new view and new possibility for the country.

3. These students are also learn knowledge from U.S., as a tax payer for the country, they already use my money here. I prefer to keep them here to let them use their knowledge help us to build the the country, not tell them go back to their home country...if you prefer to see more countries better then U.S. in future, just let them go.

4. Remember why we remain strong on the world. because of diversity, because of knowledge, because of new immigration who always encourage U.S. to go forward.
