I came to this country because it has the best education, the best talent and most importantly, its welcoming attitude towards people from all over the world, that is what make American American. The international students come to US are mostly the best among their own countries', keep them stay in US after graduation is important so they can contribute what they'v learnt to help build a better American. There are so many international student fight their ways to the top of American industry or academia, their contribution are priceless, and this should not stop at our generation. Some say the competition makes American people lost their jobs, it is funny though the international students are blamed rather than the critics their own, after all people are competing under the equal opportunity which is protected by the US law.
