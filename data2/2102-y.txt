Kevin Anonymous OPT extension will not steal jobs from Americans, because there is a huge demand in STEM field which can not be met by US citizens. The distinct OPT program also makes US as the most popular country for international students, compare to UK, Canada, Australia, etc. 
International students SUPPORT US economy by paying higher tuition and living expenses than local students. People who cry about taxpayer's money have no idea how this system works.
