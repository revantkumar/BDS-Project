President Obama, I am a 55 year old woman basically forced in my career to take on $35,000 in student debt to continue my 33 year RN career as an RN for another 7 or 8 years. You have abjectly FAILED Americans in our job markets, in our economy and have totally FAILED the American people. I oppose ANY SUCH ACTIONS being taken by you OR other branches of MY Federal Government with regards to immigration LEGAL AND ILLEGAL for ANY IMMIGRANTS until you can put American jobs first.
