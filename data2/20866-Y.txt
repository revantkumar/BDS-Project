Extension enables international students to get on-the-job training to enhance their education experience, in particular, to apply what they learned no the reality. Most students enter the labor force in the end so they view their education as a step to better prepare themselves to the careers. If they could not get sufficient work training to justify their American education, they probably would not consider American colleges and universities since the knowledge might be different from what is required in careers in their own country. Attracting talents to come and stay will definitely enhance the economy and create welfare for every person.
