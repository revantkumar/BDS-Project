We do not allow foreigners to vote in U.S. elections for a very good reason. Why are we now allowing foreign students to have a say in U.S. regulations on this site? Aren't US laws supposed to benefit US citizens first and foremost? If a law can be designed to benefit citizens interest or foreigner's interests, shouldn't the citizen's interest come first?
