Edward Caldwell If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. The additional OPT time will provide STEM graduates with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Based on the experience of last few decades, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields. They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world.
