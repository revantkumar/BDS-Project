I am strongly in favor of this rule. It has been seen over years that foreign STEM students have stronger quantitative skills generally than American students and the contribution that workers from STEM programs have made is huge to the US. It is understandable that some native Americans would think STEM students are taking jobs away from them but when it comes to reality, is there really enough qualified American students with solid knowledge to handle the quantitative work? The US economy is seeing a gradual recovery, which needs more STEM students to make their contributions in this era when science and technology are always on the frontier of economic development. Plus, STEM students also pay tax during their studying time and after getting jobs, there is little inequality in tax space. From the strategic aspect, if STEM students are no longer able to work in the US, most of them will add value to their home countries, especially India and China. The US will be facing more competition across the world because of the loss of valuable intellectuals. If that comes true one day, it will be the time that the US slips into real recession.
