I totally support opt extension.

If USA stops opt extension, no foreign students will come to pay the expensive tuitions for these master programs and bachelor degrees, which causes all the colleges to lose money. Also USA will lack cheap high end human resources. There is no benefit of stopping the opt extension policy.
