Silly opinions by some people opposing this proposal saying that foreigners will lower the salary level. How is company paying you salaries? If they cannot make money, how can they pay you more. If so many foreigners cannot work in America for high-tech area, who can replace them? Can you? If you cannot, how to make more money or even maintain the same level? How can you build more awesome product to expand the company's market? 

I totally cannot understand why people think so simple. I support this proposal!
