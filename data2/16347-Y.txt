The new policy of OPT is necessary to take place in the USA because it is beneficial to not only the United States of America but also its relationship as well as cooperation to other countries. When the F-1 students have more time for works, their groups' works will be clear in the sights of American people to let the latter learn more about both the nation that those students come from and the way to collaborate with them to come up with more beneficial achievements for the national development of USA and even the whole world. Besides, longer OPT period leads to more foreign graduated student staying in the USA for works to create more and more profits and occupational accomplishments for Americans to help them develop much better, especially in the field of STEM. As a result, the achievement of former President Bill Clinton will re-happen with the help of this new OPT law.
