I think this ruling will have more benefits than disadvantages to the U.S.

There is a misunderstanding that OPT students are taking away job
opportunities that belongs to U.S. residents. That is not true. OPT/
STEM OPT is for training and serving as a part of university education. The
OPT students who want to be working in U.S. in long term has to be converted
to H1B Visa, which the major contributor that takes away jobs from local
residents. 
Based on the 2015 data, among the filed 215000 H1B applicants,
only 30000 (less than 13%) are STEM OPT students. The results of 2015 H1B
approval also shows that only less than 15% of the approvals are given to
OPT students, the rest are granted to workers that are imported from other
countries directly. If government want to control foreign workers and keep
more jobs to local residents. The right thing is to issue a H1B policy
change. Revoking STEM OPT will do very little to help.
