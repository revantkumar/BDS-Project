To whom it may concern: I being a concerned citizen and voter we don't always know all the issues going on internally with in our government. In regards to Docket # ICE-2015-0002 have some issue's with it's content. First of all why are foreign students getting jobs, rather than U.S.citizens? I didn't know this existed until recently when Walt Disney employees were being replaced by foreigners. So after this I did some searching and found out about these E-1B visa's are all about. I certainly don't want these visa's increased. Plus why aren't U.S. citizens with the same qualifications giving the chance as the E- 1B visa people. Does the big corporations have that big an influence on our governments actions? If these foreign students on E-1B visa's aren't interested or involved in becoming U.S. citizens, I say no hiring them. I hope in the future our government and all it's departments would be as concerned about our citizen's. As it looks like about foreign students.
