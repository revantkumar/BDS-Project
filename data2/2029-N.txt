It's well documented that American Companies are hiring foreign workers over Americans.
Think Disney. I personally worked at a solar company in Perrysburg, Ohio called First Solar where I saw them hire foreign workers over better trained American workers. I was part of the hiring process.There I seen managers complain about the poor quality of work from the foreign workers and yet yet upper management would insist on hiring them saying there no trouble getting there visas. Do corporation lobbyist write these programs?
