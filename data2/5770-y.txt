krishna chaitanya I wholeheartedly welcome the new proposed stem rule by DHS.If the new proposed rule becomes reality, a non-immigrant student gets 36 months of valid work authorization which makes an employee feel comfortable to hire looking at 36 months of EAD. If it is only 12 months,the employee will not prefer that candidate if the project duration is more than a year and this happens in majority cases. This minimizes the opportunities for a eligible candidate. The non immigrant stem students come to USA with a career plan that he/she is going to pursue Master's degree for two years and then for 29 months,he/she can work in their major field of study. Then come back to their country with that immense knowledge and excel in home country. If there is no stem extension, several thousands of foreign students career will be ruined as they have to leave to their home country without any practical knowledge and start the career from the scratch. So, the STEM extension by DHS is a thing to be appreciated and hope it comes to reality very soon.
