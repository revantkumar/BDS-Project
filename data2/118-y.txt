Elaine Hozdik 1. If the STEM OPT extension rule is not approved by February 2016 and the I-765 applications will be returned; will the application fees be refunded? 

2. STEM OPT Eligibility Categories: Will health science categories, such as Exercise Sciences, Community Health, Nursing, etc. be included in the STEM OPT eligibility categories?

3. Building a feature in SEVIS that reflects a seamless history of student's record; that will reflect: schools attended, reduced course load, employment history, degrees received, etc. This feature will allow DSO's to verify student eligibility prior to authorizing STEM employment. 

4. STEM OPT: Employer's Role. The employer's obligation to report student's end of employment within 48 hours is too short of a time-frame and would be difficult to achieve, in certain situations, such as if the student's job ends on a Friday at 5:00 PM; and 48 hours after that falls on Sunday 5:00 PM, not a typical work day for a DSO. A better time-frame would be five working days!
