Hongying Wu I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:
1. To students, they will have chance and more time to make their knowledge into practice. By industry experience, they can have a deep understanding of the knowledge they acquire from school.
2. To technology companies, they have more chance to hire excellent employees and this will advance technology for both US and the world.
3. To universities in US, this proposal will help them to attract more STEM students from all over the world to US for advanced study. Because if students have more opportunities to work or intern at US, they will have more willing to come to US for study.
