I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. The U.S. education is great and make a lot of contribution for student to learn knowledge. Students can stay in the U.S and put what they learnt to work to make contribution to the U.S. society.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. The U.S have a lot of people from all over the world that gives the US a good reputation for the diversity and makes U.S people know more about different culture all over the world which is definitely good for US in economy. 

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. If the US want to maintain the status of leader developed country, it need competition. Competition can people in the US more better. If no competition, people will be lazy and not eager to learn more. What's more, the number of international students is not that big compared to the population of the US as well as a lot of students will come back to their country after several months working.

In conclude, I strongly support the proposal.
