I just would like to remind you that the hiring of Aliens is conditioned on demonstration of "their actions will not negatively affect the job opportunities, wages or working conditions of workers already residing here by demonstrating there are not enough such workers available and that the proposed wages and working conditions meet regional standards", and through the whole time when an alien is employed, "the employer must also actively attempt to recruit workers already residing in the US to fill the position, including newspaper and radio advertising".
