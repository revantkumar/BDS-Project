I cannot see any reason to oppose this regulation. Lots of people are afraid that US citizens will lose their job opportunities.It does not make sense at all. Us tech companies will definitely prefer US citizens comparing to international students if they have the same skill sets because US citizens can work without any restrictions. If these companies can find enough citizen employees, why they would bother to hire international students and get more troubles? So it is obvious international employee are actually taking the jobs that Us citizens will not take.
