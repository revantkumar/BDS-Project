Erik Acosta Okay let's be realistic. Does U.S. need just more labors or actual technicians and engineers? If we leave all these spaces to US-born graduates, are they really qualified for this job? Can they really improve the U.S. economics and the development of technology? I deeply doubt that. OPT holders are being a GREAT part of the U.S. economics.
