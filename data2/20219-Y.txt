I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. One of the important reasons that I chose US university over Cambridge and Oxford is that US provides a good period time's OPT so that we can gain industrial experience after graduation. 

If OPT extension is cancelled without replacement, I believe it will make US universities far less competitive. And I believe a lot of Chinese students will make a different choice.
