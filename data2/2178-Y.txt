Please do not expand the availability of OPT for foreign students. This proposal is based on a false perception that there is a shortage of workers educated or trained science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. I am a Ph.D. student in physics. In my experience in graduate school, I have learned first-hand that there is a glut, not a shortage, of Americans interested in these fields. When I was working on my Master's Degree, I was in a program where I saw a number of strong American students who did not get accepted to any of the Ph.D. programs they applied to. I myself only got into two out of eight that I applied for when I went for my Master's and 2 out of 7 when going for Ph.D. programs. More than 40% of the graduate students in that department where I got my Master's were foreign. The inescapable conclusion from this was that Americans who are interested in STEM fields are being crowded out by foreign students. Opportunity for physics Ph.D.'s is very limited upon graduation. They are considered lucky if they can get accepted to a temporary postdoctoral position that pays some $30,000 a year....
