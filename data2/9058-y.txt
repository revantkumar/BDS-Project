Aaron Lockheart I agree with this rule. 
By hiring more high-tech talents, this country will grow even stronger. This rule will also attract other talented students from all over the world to help make America better. It will not affect normal US workers because we can not provide as many high-tech workers as this country needs. This rule will only benefit this great nation.
