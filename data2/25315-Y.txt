The pass of this rule will bring America significant benefits.

First, many international STEM degree students represent the most promising intellectual force of the new generation. Their countries couldn't wait calling them back to construct their countries such as China, India and etc. These countries are rising unprecedentedly fast and, armed with the well educated young people back to homelands, would be major competitors to the US. If these people are seeking opportunities in the US, we certainly should let them be here.

Second, without competitive environment domestically, our workers will only charge for more and be less motivated to bring innovation or to refine their technologies in order to be able to beat their competitors. Yes, in a globalized world, competitions are already prevalent, but without the competition from finding jobs on, many Americans would simply not realize how reality works. American labor force has much lower efficiency compared to their German or Japanese counterparts. If we want them to be strong again, we should give equal opportunities to international job candidates.

Third, it is nearly down right myopia for people living in the world's most powerful country to say that international people are stealing their welfare. America is a mature capitalistic market. We encourage the proposition that competition brings upward thrusts to drive the country forward. We also know that the scarcity of labor force is and will be the status quo throughout the entire human history, which means that those claims of aliens' threats are mostly false and are mainly used to serve for propaganda carried out by certain interest groups. We are conceived in openness, equality and competition, so we should strengthen these basis of our strong economic power and leadership of worldwide market.
