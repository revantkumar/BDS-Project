I think this is a good proposal. I believe extending the opt stem to 24 months will ensure the stem students to have the first hand industry experience based on their solid academic background. We all know that university is a place to learn, not to implement. Having at least 24 months industry experience is really benefitial to the students and I think that's what the professor would like to see, that their students are implementing what their have learned from school to contribute to the society.

With the above mentioned reasons, I strongly support this.

Yours,
