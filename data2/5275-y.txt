Xi Zhang I support this improvement and expansion of training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees. As STEM is of great significance to United States's development, this very important improvement and expansion will definitely secure US strength and leadership in the world now and in the future. Every country is doing anything good to itself. What about US? Of course US should do and must do. I hope this improvement and expansion of OPT extension will be approved and taken into effect soon.
