American Citizen's & DHS, Please do understand, we are not taking your Jobs.
we are just filling the gaps, which are available.

Please question your self, why will employers,
1. Take Risk 
2. spend more money for sponsoring the visa's, if they are able to find the local candidate.

Hence i request, DHS to implement this rule by Feb 14th 2016, so that no student working on OPT will be impacted.
Next, please extend this duration to 36 months, that will give enough time for employee to get hands on experience.

USA universities have trained foreign students & why do USA want to loose this talented creamy layer.
Train them --> send them back home --> To work as competitors for USA?
