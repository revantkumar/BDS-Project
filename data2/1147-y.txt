Zane Li I am a STEM OPT worker and I am very thankful that I can acquire advanced industrial working experience and networking which will become an invaluable asset in my future career. In the mean time, I firmly believe that having STEM OPT extension will bring huge benefit to the US economy and help remain the country SUPERPOWER.

First of all, education and living expense of international students has already become an important part of the country's economy. It would certainly attract more international students with the new OPT extension rule.

Secondly, most of the international STEM students are top-notch students from their own countries. They are smart and hard working. It would be a big loss to the US economy if the country fail to attract this great working force at their best years by letting them go back home soon after their graduation.

Last but not least, with more exceptional international students from over the world, there is a much better chance for continuous technology innovation and business cooperation between the students' home countries. This will surely help US remain SUPERPOWER in the long run. Just as history has proven.

In conclusion, STEM OPT extension is a win-win situation for both the US and international students. I hereby give my strongest support for this rule!
