The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program is nothing more than
corporate welfare. The proposed rule extends the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one 
year to three years; expanding the pool of available workers and allowing employers to depress wages in order to avoid paying 
their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy 
business owners at the expense of American workers. This proposal should be trashed; it's time to take care of our own!
