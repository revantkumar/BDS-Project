This is very good step taken by USA government. I support this, because bottom line - it gives freedom to the Graduates and the country/companies gets skilled employees. Unlike the other visas which are risk, complexity involved for the companies to apply a petition. This is providing better future for the foreign nationals, which USCIS is all about. Hail USCIS, Hail USA.
