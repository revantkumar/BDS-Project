Wenqian Zhao I really support the proposed rule. We all know the United State is the most advanced country in education. Many elites from all over the world come to the United States to get a further study. One of the reasons why they choose the United States is the benefit of OPT. Students can get an opportunity to work for a year after graduation. Other countries like UK do not have such good rule, so many elites choose to study in the USA instead of the UK although the UK also have many great universities like Cambridge and Oxford. But actually 12-month-length is still a little bit short, if the OPT is extended to 24 months, the USA will definitely attracts much more students from other countries. Then the universities will have more money to do the research, pay salary to professors and improve their facilities. All these things will further attract more students and form a virtuous circle. Also, if the number of international students increases a lot, because they have to consume in the USA, the economy of the USA will be much better. More jobs are created and the unemployment rate will decline. All these things are positive to the country. So, let it pass and the USA will become stronger and more prosperous.
