This proposal is quite alarming for the American worker. From what I have read to date Optional Practical Training (OPT) has: 

- Denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
- Removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

With the expansion of this program the above numbers will only increase. Please advise how this proposal will prevent the above issues from continuing and expanding? 

Furthermore, this appears to me be just another ploy to create a shadow H-1B program to import more foreign workers to take jobs away from American citizens because allegedly "we cost too much". 

Please do not expand this program. The cost is too high and it continues to take away jobs from American citizens.
