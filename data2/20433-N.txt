RE: Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for
F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for all Eligible F-1 Students.

The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training Program would be a
detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow US companies to hire 
foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the US. This would artificially expand the pool of 
available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put
downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign
students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should 
serve the interest of American workers, not act against it.
