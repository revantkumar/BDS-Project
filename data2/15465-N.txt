This plan punishes American graduates in STEM related fields.
DHSs plan gives foreign student graduates jobs that American students desperately need! 

Giving employers the tax incentive to hire from a pool of foreign students undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.

Optional Practical Training Program participants are sought after because they are cheaper than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 % when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they dont pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60k-$90k a year range but they cost Social Security about $1 billion a year!

The OPT program is a bad idea.
