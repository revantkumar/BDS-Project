For everyone coming to America, the OPT policy really do encourage us to work hard in US because it protects us to find jobs. We do feel excited while we are told that the new policy is supposed to extend other 12 months. When we finished our study in US, we have the ability to find jobs to contribute to this country. More time is like a guarantee.
