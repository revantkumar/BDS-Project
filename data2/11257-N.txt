There is no such thing as a job that a U.S. Citizen won't do. There is simply low wage competition from foreign workers that drives down the compensation for jobs to the point that a citizen can't make a living wage doing that work. We need to stop pricing our citizens out of the labor force. This is destroying the middle class to benefit big business and the top 1% that owns big business.
