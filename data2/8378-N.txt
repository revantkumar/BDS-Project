This idea is absolutely ludicrous. Everyday kids in school are told to reach for the stars and good jobs will still be available. They are told go to school, further your education, never mind about massive student loans you can't pay back. Why? This is flat out lie and American kids deserve better from their government. Government needs to stop selling out our kids and adults by making good on the promise of go to school and you will qualify for the better wage jobs that provide a decent living. No one with a college degree should be trapped in low wage, dead end jobs. It is unconscionable! Don't you dare vote for this kind of garbage legisation, no matter what the lobbyists promise. Be on the side of the American kids for once!
