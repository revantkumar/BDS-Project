Vamsi B First of all i would like to appreciate "OPT extension for 24 months ", So many international students contributing their efforts to US growth. If the "OPT extension is revoked so many international students will be on roads with financial problems and it will become a big remark to USA", because so many students are paying the college fees from bank loans & they are contributing billions of dollars to the US economy. As per my opinion "24 months of OPT extension wont enough,its better to consider 36 months or more duration".
Hope i will see a good decision from DHS.

Thank you !
