This horrible idea comes as no surprise to me because of what we have been seeing in recent years! WHY propose something so wrong headed when we have millions of unemployed people in this country? 

As you may have surmised, I'm totally against this idea of expanding the OPT program that has been shown to deprive Americans of jobs and take monies from the Social Security program. BAD IDEA!
