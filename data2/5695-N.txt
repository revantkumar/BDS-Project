I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. I am a retired person who was born here in the United States, worked all my life and raised a great family. I have six grandchildren in college and soon they will be looking for jobs. To think that immigrants will be given jobs before them is a disgrace to all Americans. We Americans should be given the first opportunity for these jobs. I thought America was for the American people, but this president seems to give the immigrants more respect then Americans. This final year of his can't go by soon enough for the American people.
