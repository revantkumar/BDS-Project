It is appalling to me that our politicians are more concerned with immigrants benefits and opportunities then they are with citizens. By taking such an action it would cause our students to have to compete for jobs in a problematic job market!

So I guess this is one of the places that the money that would be given for the cost of living increase for Veterans and Senior Citizen is going!!!
