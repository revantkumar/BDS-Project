Zhuoqun Zeng I feel this new rule for OPT extension proposed by DHS is an important way of showing people the fair and justice behind the America's value, and the open attitude towards all talented people who have their own aspirations and dreams, and also have knowledge and ability to realize them. There is no doubt that these talented people attracted by this consistently insistent policy has benefited the development of United States a lot for the past decades, especially in the fields of science and technology (STEM).

OPT and its extension provide a special bridge for connection between America and the world. It is a key factor why United States attracts hundreds of thousands of students to come to study. Most of them will play important roles in the cutting-edge research in academic institute or high-tech development of pillar industries after graduation if they can get chances to be able to work. They are making contributions to this country as well when they help their companies to improve revenue and competitiveness or conduct research in academic projects.

The extension of OPT will give those students possibility to have a different track of life, a way that can also benefit the US results from just a little more flexibility. In addition to the development of science and technology, they are helping to activate our society in terms of innovation, creativity and diversity, which I believe are the most important factors that keep the high-speed development of different industries and America's leading position in the world. It can be a great loss of all these advantages and prominent influences for creative companies and research institutes if we revoke the extension.
