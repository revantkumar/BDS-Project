I think this is a very positive direction. I am in support of extending the OPT period. There are a lot of companies loosing good valuable employees on F1 VISA because of the chance of H1B approval being so low. 

In addition, I would recommend to establish regulation to prohibit international "Consulting Firm" to abuse the H1B lottery by submitting same candidate with multiple job positions under the same parent company. 

We need good, honest, successful employee to work in U.S. and filter out those who trying to use "short-cut" to stay.
