Kenneth Woo I strongly oppose the DHS proposal to expand the OPT program. It should be cut back and totally eliminated.

I am a son of a WW2 vet who placed his life on the line for this country so his children would have greater opportunities
for economic advance. I lost my father at an early age but still managed to obtain my BS while living in the ghettos of Chicago. I was unemployed for nearly 1 1/2 years before my first low paying job as an engineer. During the late seventies,
the economy took off and I managed to become a R&D engineer for a major aerospace company BECAUSE OF A TRUE
ENGINEERING SHORTAGE. I held that last job for 14 years until I had completed the company goals. I was told in college
that having a broad technical background would enable me to easily obtain further work. TRUE IF THE FOREIGNERS WERE NOT HERE!
