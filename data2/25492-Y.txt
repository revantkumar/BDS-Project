I generally don't comment online at all, and this might be my first one ever. I suddenly have the urge to do it after reading this post. 
I have been told that there have been some voice against this new proposal, which did not surprise me at all. For people who 
need it they would defend and support on it, and for those who don't they might be on the other side. However, I constantly 
hear people, like this one, saying that foreign students steal their jobs. On one hand, this might be true as the employer would get
a larger candidate pool and pick a better candidate. But this would do US economic good overall. On the other hand, however, 
their argument is against the US policies to attract talented and enthusiastic student/personnel to US and equal employ opportunity 
act. And to be honest, international student would have to work harder to get employed. If I am the employer and have two equally 
qualified candidates, one citizen and one international, I would more likely to pick the citizen candidate which would save lots of hiring
work and sponsor fees. Therefore, I totally disagree with the argument stated above. Thanks!
