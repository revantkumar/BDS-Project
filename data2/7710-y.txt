Xuesen Li I strongly support this proposal for extending the OPT period for F-1 student with STEM Degrees.

Hundreds of years ago, people came to this massive land to pursue the American Dream of Democracy, Rights, Liberty, Opportunity, and Equality, which also serves as the foundation of this nation. Nowadays, millions of talent students, scholars and engineers also come here and hope to share the same dream. They are not pirates who pillage resources and jobs; in contrast, they are building up this country with their knowledge and skills, and at the same time, realizing their own dreams. They deserve to receive equal opportunities to live, to work and to develop their career here.
