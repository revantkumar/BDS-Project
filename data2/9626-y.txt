Bryan Wright It is unjust and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. 
Once you lose those foreign tech workers, the supply cannot meet the demand. The only way for tech companies to continue making profits is to send their jobs to overseas companies in India, China or somewhere the salary is lower. Right now, this is happening. The salary in those companies are growing slowly even stop growing because the job was send to somewhere else rather than in the US.
There are more regulations for a company to hire the foreign worker. No one wants to take the hard way unless you have to. Tech companies hire foreign workers is a must, they want a easy way just hiring citizens but they cannot meet the demand, the only way to continue their business is to hire foreign workers. Without the foreign workers, companies will send their job to India or China because they can not meet the demand in the US.
Anyway, the foreign workers still pay the same amount of tax as a citizen does. They are contributing to the country. Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tremendous growth to the USA economy. USA needs the talents from foreign workers to keep its machines running well, and running better than the rest of the world.
