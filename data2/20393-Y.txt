In my opinion, not only certain F1 nonimmigrant students but also the whole American Society will get benefit from this amended proposal. 

F1 Nonimmigrant students in STEM majors will have more opportunity to gain valuable practical experience after they graduated. They will have longer time to search for a job. And they will gain a longer working experience while they are in the US, an advantage for them to work internationally particular in their home countries. 

American job marketing has an increase demand for STEM major graduates. However, less than 30% students in some of the STEM majors are green card holder or US citizens. More than 50% STEM graduates are F1 nonimmigrant students. On the one hand, industry companies, especially those high-tech companies, find that it is very hard to find capable STEM major graduates to work for them. In order to compete with other companies for the small group of STEM graduates with green card or citizenship, they need to pay more money to those employees. And this huge cost will be a real burden for company development. On the other hand, non-immigrant STEM major graduates thrive for opportunities to gain working experience in the US. But currently regulations limited their possibility on this pursuit. So, the new proposal gives benefits to both these students and industry companies. 

Thus, I sincerely hope this proposal will get passed.
