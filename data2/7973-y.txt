Ke Huang I definitely SUPPORT this proposed new rule! 

We all need to realize that granting OPT to international students does NOT equal to giving them jobs for free! It only provides highly educated foreign talents a fair opportunity to be placed in the market along with other American jobseekers. Foreign students actually need to work extra hard and perform extra well to stand out, as most companies prefer to hire Americans among equally qualified candidates. Thus, this rule will bring only the best talents to help contribute to the America society. 

This rule will only BENEFIT the Americans! In the short run, high tech companies and research institutes will be able to retain enough workforce to keep making profits and make the economy running. In the long run, America can only remain its super power by attracting the best talents worldwide. America has won its place today just because of this society's inclusivity and diversity. 

Let's not jeopardize the future of USA by shutting foreign talents who want to contribute out of the gate!!!
