Sharon Pannell This program takes jobs away from Americans since it gives employers a financial incentive to hire foreigners over Americans. Employers don't pay certain payroll taxes on foreign workers, making them cheaper and more appealing. It perpetuates the lie that there aren't enough American STEM workers to hire when they are being put out of work or overlooked for foreign workers who can be paid much less. With so many Americans working in fields other than those they prepared for since employers and giving precedence to foreign workers, this program should be scrapped completely. American jobs need to be made available to Americans first. IF there are then any vacancies, foreign workers can fill them.
