Hello my friend , people from other countries contributing much in the field of IT and other technologies to USA and in their countries too.
It's unfair to say people don't know to speak English and work , if Americans are really capable non of the companies will go for foreign workers and no need for sponsorship from American companies to spend on them issue all kind of benefits 
You can check the USA growth has increased a lot because of foreign workers .
