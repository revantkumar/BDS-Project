I do not know why some people object this OPT extension. The reason for supporting this is quite obvious. 


The duration of an extension would be set at 24 months, rather than limited to a shorter period, due to the complexity and typical time of research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields. Affording greater participation in STEM training through changes to the period of the STEM OPT extension would also help the nation and its academic institutions remain competitive in light of global efforts offering international students longer post-study training experience without restrictions on the type of work that may be performed.

Thanks
