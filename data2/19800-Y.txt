This is a great proposal. There are so many international talents working for tech companies in US nowadays. Depends on both American and international workers' efforts, US has the greatest tech companies in the world now and in the future. During the OPT period, international students can gain most valuable experience from industry which gives them a huge benefit when they go back to their countries to continue their careers. Also OPT policy makes it possible for tech companies to hire enough excellent employees. It's a win-win game for United States and international students. Most projects on tech companies take more than one year. Without the OPT extension, international employees most likely can not even accomplish a complete project for their companies before they leave. That will be a big loss and trouble for those companies. There's no hurt, but so many benefits for US to provide the OPT extension.
