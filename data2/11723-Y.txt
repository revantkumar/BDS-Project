I approve of this new STEM OPT policy!As a US citizen,I feel so sad after reading some opposed comments.Our US CITIZENS even use the word'STEAL' to say that the foreign students steal their jobs.It is very ridiculous!The only reason that some US citizens lose the jobs is they are lazy and not as smart as the foreign students.Even I provide a job offer to our native Americans,I do not think that they can handle this!Because most of the American students are not graduate from the STEM major.I will not waste my money offering the job position to US citizens who can not handle the work!!
As a manager of pharmacy company,I definitely need the foreign STEM major students to work for me!The foreign students are much smarter and more hard-working,so could anybody give a reason that I can not hire F-1 nonimmigrant students instead of hiring some lazy Americans ??
Just prolong the OPT period!!!Just do it!!We need them working for USA.
