NO, NO EXTENSION, NO OPT either. Deport all the smart ass foreigners who beat the native students in all subjects out of the country right after they graduate, like they break some law or what. Let them take the skills they learned here back to their home country so they can use them to beat the US. We should definitely provide them no job opportunities at all, so that the lazy ass "native citizens" can take the jobs they "think" they are qualified for. At that time we will all be witness of the fall of America. 

And by the way, let's open our arms and hug all the illegal immigrants into this country. That's the information we are sending to the rest of the world: If you want to become a US citizen, being smart, study hard, getting a job and contribute to this country will not work, you need to crawl through fences, through tunnels, through deserts, and do cheap labor work! That's like saying: WE ONLY NEED SLAVES! 

I know you all want to talk about money, how big companies want to use this as a way to save money. Then how about the ridiculous amount of tuition they are paying, how about all the money and taxes they spend here? They are bringing hundreds of billions of dollars into the US every year. Think about how many jobs they creates, and what if these money is all gone because foreign students see no job opportunities after they graduate. Nowadays, many public universities are using the money they make from foreign students to subsidize in-state students. So they are not the reason you can't find a job, they are the reason you have a job.

To be honest, the United States is the greatest country on this planet, not because the people born here are the greatest, but because America makes many of the greatest people around the world Americans. So once America stops doing this, he's giving himself a death penalty.
