I strongly support the extension. It not only helps the development of economy and technology in the US, but also push Americans to strengthen themselves so that they can compete with foreign students. Competition is a major motivation to the development and progress of something, we should support legal and fair competition to make the world a better place. Non-competition environment will result in lazy people making no progress!
