I strongly support the OPT extension.

Right on the contrary of many anti-OPT-extension opinions, OPT holders are NOT cheap labors, and they are not stealing away jobs from Americans by getting lower wages. Since OPT extension requires the job to be directly related to the person's degree, the OPT extension holders CANNOT do whatever jobs they want to do. They do not have choice over what job they can get. They are totally passive in the job hunting. If a company would like to hire an OPT holder, his wage by law CANNOT be lower than the wage of citizens. In other words, the US citizens are more competitive than those OPT holders.

Moreover, as I just said, OPT holders' jobs have to be directly related to their degree on which they're been trained for years to be excellent. And some of them were supported by their universities as teaching assistants, or by the government science funds as research assistants. They've been using the US government's money to complete their degrees and get professional knowledge. And now should America just let them leave for free WITHOUT doing any contribution back to the great country which just supported them? I just think this is even more unfair for the United States.
