This program is being abused and is not being used the way for which it was initially set up. We need to hire from within our country FIRST! Our young people in this country deserve to have first shot at any available jobs. Those businesses who hire young people from overseas in order to pay cheaper wages are doing so to get away with not paying taxes such as FICA and Social Security. THIS WILL IMPACT ME AND FUTURE GENERATIONS THAT WILL DEPEND ON SOCIAL SECURITY WHEN THEY RETIRE!!! IT'S NO WONDER THAT SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE BANKRUPT IN A FEW YEARS! (And, really, it is already!!!) Why is this being allowed! Do not allow the President to expand this program. To quote Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa : "The proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was 'full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.'"
DO NOT EXPAND THIS PROGRAM!!!
