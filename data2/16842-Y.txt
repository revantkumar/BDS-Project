I fully agree with the intentions of DHS to increase the STEM OPT extension from the current 17 to 24 months. It will bring much needed relief for students and employers in high industry to train and retain them. These students work in industries that are at the forefront of innovations, any talk of getting rid of the OPT is economically a bad decision. Students with advanced degrees don't take jobs away from native but intact create value for the economy, thereby creating jobs for everyone. 
Other countries are taking steps to attract students who pursue STEM degrees, the only way the US can retain the number 1 position in innovation is to make the immigration laws attarctive to them.
