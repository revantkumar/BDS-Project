I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:
1. F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees can bring positive influence on American economy in general because with these students entering the specific job markets, the increasing competition between job-seekers gives employers more opportunities to recruit people of better quality. Thus, the companies will be efficient. As a result, those companies can contribute more GDP and thus improve the standard of living for Americans.
2. With a more favorable OPT policy, more and more international students will come to the US to pursue their higher education. Given that most of international students are currently studying at public universities, increasing number of international applicants to American public universities offers these institutions a way to relieve their financial pressure by accepting more excellent international students. The extra tuition income for public universities can substitute part of federal or state funding. Therefore, the federal government or states can use money on more urgent and important projects.
