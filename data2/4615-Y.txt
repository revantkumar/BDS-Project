I do agree with the OPT extension.
OPT extension can give students who majored in STEM more opportunities to practice themselves through application. I majored in Statistics currently. I know that many international students are attracted by the great working experiences that US companies can offer due to their advanced techniques and innovation spirit. In the other hand, international students contribute to the companies as well through both technical aspect and cultural aspect.
