I strongly support the new STEM OPT extension. It helps the US government and companies to attract talented students to make contribution to the US economy. Without OPT, most STEM students have to leave the US a short time after they graduate, making almost no contribution to the US, then what's the purpose of recruiting them into the US universities? Also, I don't think the international students make the US citizens unemployed. At least in the recruitment process of the high-tech companies, race and nationality is the least important factor, if it is considered at all. I agree that there will be some competition when both international students and the US citizens are on the job market. But competition helps people have more incentives to study harder, to improve themselves, right? If US and US citizens were not brave enough to compete with others, how did this country become so strong?
