Often the STEM graduate students in the US have worked on key areas and technologies which are essential for the USA to maintain its technological edge and maintain its economic prowess. The proposed extension will also allow the students to further develop their expertise without additional barriers. Allowing the students to continue working on OPT for additional 24 months will help the american society harness this expertise even more. It will also promote tremendous goodwill between the US and the home countries of these students.
