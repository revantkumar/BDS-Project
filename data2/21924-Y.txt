Students work very hard for 5 years to get their STEM PhD degrees. During these five years they work on various research projects and publish papers in scientific journals. Most of these trained students continue their research after obtaining PhD degree by becoming postdoc's. Postdoc's generally work on NSF, USDA, DOE, and EPA projects and most of these government projects require at least three years to complete. Expanding OPT to three years for STEM students will provide an opportunity to complete these government research projects and to publish results.These publications will take science forward. Thus I welcome this STEM OPT rule
