swati hegde As an international student, from Stony Brook University, I have realized that gaining experience in the field of our major is of utmost important. The OPT period allows the students to contribute to the nation economically and technologically. Many of the start ups in the US are founded by foreign nationals who have studied under STEM. And they are the one of the reasons for creating significant amount of job opportunities in the US. So I highly support the OPT STEM extension for F1 students.
