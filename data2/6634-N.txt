To Homeland Security:

As several critics have rightly pointed out, by increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years the Administration has already established a de facto shadow H-1B program. This move is clearly opposed to the intent of Congress.
Moreover, a GAO report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it. The government does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country, and ICE cannot ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status here.
OPT should be at most a temporary training program, not a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor instead of American citizens. We urge the Administration to follow the intent of current laws, and to place the interests of American students first.
