Amanda Short A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership and quantitative skills. Americans who engaged with international students while on campus are more likely in later life to appreciate art and literature, place current problems in historical perspective and read or speak a foreign language as per survey from duke university. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus.
