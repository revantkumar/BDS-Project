Xiaoxiao Yu I strongly SUPPORT this proposal due to the following reasons:

The OPT extension policy is one of the most important reason why I choose the U.S universities to pursuing my master degree, instead of the other countries. the extension practice time let me have a sufficient time to translate the knowledge from books to a real scenario. To be a software developer, as much as I know, there are huge numbers of the international students work in the IT area under OPT-ext status, they are making huge contribution to the high technology development of U.S. Terminate this policy will be a immeasurable loss for U.S
