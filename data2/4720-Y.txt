I strongly support the OPT extension rule since it is a very important policy to retain talented, skilled students from all other in U.S., which is required for America to maintain its rapid develop in tech and economy. 

International students working for U.S. under OPT benefit, not harm US economy and society:

1) According to NAFSA (Association of International Educators), 2013-2014 only international students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to U.S. economy, that is for every 7 international students enrolled, 3 U.S. jobs are created or supported. The OPT rule, if passed, will definitely attract more international students, and the American economy will further benefit from it.

2) International students fill up the gap between labor demand and the native labor supply in tech. Note U.S. students have far more chances to get hired compared with international students. Those who claim international students take away American's jobs, just think about that how much less trouble for those tech companies to hire U.S. citizens only than to hire foreigners, no H1B, no sponsorship. But the real problem is, there are NOT as many qualified U.S. citizens to satisfy the rapidly growing labor demand in IT field. 

As a conclusion, the OPT extension is necessary for IT, for the economy and entire society of U.S.. Educating students for other countries and not allowing or minimizing the chance for them to work for U.S., just does not make sense.
