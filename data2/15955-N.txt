Basically the rules would allow US based employers to hire foreign students instead of US citizens. The idea of training foreign students to learn skills to take back to their home countries is then circumvented. They in effect replace US workers/students and at the same time deprive their home countries of the trained people they need. In other words this whole process does exactly the opposite of what it was intended to do. This does nothing to put US citizens to work but deprives the people paying the bills of the jobs they should have. In addition because of certain tax breaks and FICA exemptions the government programs for US workers do not receive the proper funds they need to run the programs they are assigned to administer. Remember the pilots of the 9/11 attacks were trained in this country and several overstayed their visas. The lack of jobs, training for those jobs and opportunity for jobs is a very big part of the dissatisfaction in many inner city areas, things have gotten worse not better if anything. This dissatisfaction is spilling over into other areas.
