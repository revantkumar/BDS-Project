I have two sons who have graduated from college, but still have not found good paying jobs in their fields. Thankfully, they are employed, but underemployed. I do know families where their teenage children have not had the opportunity to work at that first job because so many immigrants have already secured those part-time jobs. I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with our government's immigration policies and the lack of following the rule of law. 

The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up toe 29 months in certain fields of study. the program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.

What has happened to the leadership of our nation which is supposed to PROTECT our citizens. In the last 10 years our beloved country has sadly spiraled down so far from its once great standing. Is that by design? I pray someone in authority will begin to think about the preservation of our nation that has done so much good in the world instead of its destruction.
