This rule - OPT extension always brings all benefits to the U.S. and the economy and no harm to the economy at all! It will keep all the brilliant minds in the world to stay in the U.S. and make their significant contribution to the country. Thats why the U.S. can keep the leadership in Education, Industry, Economic, Technology and Science in the world.

If OPT extension is aborted, those international students may instead go back to their home country, and build next Google, Apple, Facebook, Miscrosoft and etc. to compete with U.S. And the job opportunities will go to these countries, and the U.S. and workers here would suffer, and might not keep the leadership in the world any more! 

Can you imagine, if the brilliant minds all go to other countries, will the U.S. still be the great U.S. any more? NO! The U.S. will lose the science and technology leadership to other countries, and will lose innovation, industries, and thus job opportunities to other countries. The best products will be coming out from the U.S. any more, people will not buy products and services from here, and the workers here will lose their jobs. That U.S. will no longer be the great U.S. any more! 

Let the rule save the U.S. and save the great country, and save the best science, tech, industry and the best job opportunities here! 

The OPT extension does all kinds of good to the U.S. and the people. The U.S. just cannot afford to lose it!
