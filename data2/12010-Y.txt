First of all, More than 90% STEM students are non-citizens in U.S.(Reference 1). More than 60% are graduate level and above. Many of them have already made a lot of contribution to the development of science and technology during school time. They could also continue to contribute their skills and knowledge after graduated to US.

Secondly, non-citizens also pay federal taxes, state taxes and local taxes. Many of them also highly involved in local community volunteer work. They should have the right to work here. There are already lots of jobs require citizenship. This is the protection for citizens. Companies hire non-citizens when they cannot find a suitable citizen. Therefore, OPT extension won't impact any of the existing job opportunities for citizens. Additionally, many large companies (like Amazon, Google, Apple.etc)have a high percentage of non-citizenship employees, OPT extension will help industry continue to produce as before or maybe even better. Otherwise, it will cause a halt in US industry chain which will lead to immeasurable lose for the entire country.

Thirdly, United States is an immigration country. "Diverse, Mulitcultural and United" that is what make today's US. This philosophy works great for hundreds years and we should keep it for the future.
