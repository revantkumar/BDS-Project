I say no to this. We need to do more to help young US citizens continue their education and employment status and REDUCE the amount of time & money we expend helping foreigners. Statisics show that even if they obtain citizenship the majority move back to their homeland and use the knowledge we gave them to its benefit and not ours. Only if they renounce their homeland's citizenship should they be given any sort of help as a US citizen with NO dual citizenship and the understanding that they must remain here or repay all benefits received BEFORE they allowed to leave!
