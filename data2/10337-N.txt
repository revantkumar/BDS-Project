As a former Director of International Student Affairs at The University of Alabama (and foreign student advisor). I am very familiar with the F-1 Visa and the Practical Training provision.

As a college professor, I am also aware of the problems American STEM graduates are having finding jobs after college, and as public policy is my area, I know that the expansion of programs for immigrants of all sorts, has caused problems for Americans - let me list them:

1) Older Americans are losing their jobs and being replaced by younger immigrants;

2) American graduates, competing with foreign graduates are losing out to the foreign graduates;

3) American blacks are losing out to foreign immigrants for entry level jobs.

I may love the world; I may love foreign students; I may favor international education, but I am first an American and I do not favor the world over my own.

A few other things:

1) The DHS plan exempts beneficiaries from payroll taxes - making them bargains for employers.

2 ) The Economic Policy Institute (2013) said there are plenty of American workers, with and without degrees, qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors, and Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.

3) If companies are allowed to use the H-1B and OPT programs to hire cheaper, younger, more compliant workers, instead of hiring Americans in software and tech areas, all I can say is "this is just plain wrong."
