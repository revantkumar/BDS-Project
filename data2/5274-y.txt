Petter McGrad Highly support this rule. This rule is not only good for STEM students but also for American. As we all know, American is a power country with advanced Science and Technology, so this country needs a lot of STEM students who obtained advanced degrees to help this country get a higher level in Science and Technology. And also, a lot of tech-company, such as Google, Facebook, they need those smart, talent people to work for them, to help them make more proud products which could change the world. So this rule is really good decision for this country and for this country's people.

Best,
Petter
