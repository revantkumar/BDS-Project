when is this government going to start working for americans. until every american that wants a job has a job , seal the borders and stop immigration, it's time to start wiping the regulations off the books, send the illegals home, till government can start functioning like a government , the people in washington are making millions while every one else suffers and you never heart one word about cutting there salaries and benefits, they are allowed to do things that we the people are not allowed to do , and if we do we whined up in prison, why are we training the rest of the world and letting our kids out in the cold, trillions of dollars of debt and the country is falling apart, the big cities have infurstructure that was built back in 1900,the roads and bridges are falling apart, and all you ever hear is we don't have the money to fix them, while d.c. spends a million dollars a minute, government refuses to do the few things it was ment to do , and doing every thing it was never ment to do , for me i am just sick and tired of government think it has the right to tell me how to live my life
