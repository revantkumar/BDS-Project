Golam Rabbani I strongly support the new DHS proposal for "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students". It will immensely help STEM F-1 students in gaining valuable training and also give US employers access to this highly qualified work force. Thanks.
