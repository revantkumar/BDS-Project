Bryan Kelley I highly support the new extension of OPT. As a veteran IT work in Bay Area, as a US citizen with pride, I would say many international students have contributed to this field a lot. Not only has our economy benefited from that, but also all the companies. And high-tech companies really need more hands now than ever since the competition nowadays has never been this heated. We are competing with other nations, and see how fast other countries have been growing. With extension of OPT, companies can save money on the expansion of the new employees training. Due to the nature of the industry, 12 months is really not enough. This is not something that will take jobs away from our citizens. Those people who has been laid off are those who have not got higher education. We always need elites in tech industry no matter where they are from. I highly support the new rule. This is something that would really make our country greater.
