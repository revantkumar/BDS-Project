Firstly, I should state I support OPT extension. Why? The reasons are listed below. 
1, The reason why so many international students choose US's academical institute for further study is because WE HAVE OPT, which means they can get valuable experience in a real life working environment after graduation. This is critical, because a student without any working experience is not that welcome to companies. And 1 year's OPT is not enough at all. Just imagine what you can do and learn just within 1 year, you can understand it.
2. Attracting international students to our country is so important and it actually bring lots of benefit to our local economy. In a short term, the international students consume products and spend money on local business. In a long term, they will contribute their knowledge to OUR society, this is the crux. The reason why they can come to US is they are smarter and work harder than their peers, if they can work for us and they can definitely bring true value to our society. People may say they will steal our jobs, but actually they don't. A lot of companies never hire international students because they don't want to pay for the lawyer fee and risk of losing them after 1 or 2 years when the visa is expired. Therefore, the international student who can get a job here are actually true heroes, they just try so hard and make it, they can get the job because they are so qualified not because they are foreigners. Working with smart and nice people is everybody's dream, I think, so why bother? 

All in all, OPT extension is not only about international students being allowed to get a job, it is about local economy, academical competitive power and even the definition of our own future. Support it!
