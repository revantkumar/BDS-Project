Lang Zhou I strongly agree with these Regulations. International students in STEM field can help U.S. develop more working opportunities and thus improve U.S. economics.

Jobs in STEM field are key for the country to get rid of the large number of unemployment. These positions help U.S. create more job opportunities for people.

As an immigrant country, international students also bring in more diversity for the country.

Therefore, These Regulations are excellent for the benefits of the country.
