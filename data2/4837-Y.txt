Currently I am an international phD student in a renowned university in USA, mainly because USA attracted me with full scholarship and good working and research environment. I spent best years of my youth doing hard research in hope of getting my diploma and living my personal american dream. I do think my work/research would have great impact to the society sooner or later. By extending the OPT, out international students could have more chances staying here otherwise we would leave us for our home country and build our career over there. International students,especially STEM students are the most valuable assets in the world. If the USA want to keep its leading position in science and technology, USA must try every means to help to stay, OPT extension is only one of the slightest things that could and should be done. I know many of my friends who went back to china after graduation from USA, they become the most competitive worker and leader for the Chinese company. One key thing that we shall keep in mind is educated students should be considered as assets instead of burdens, they created wealth and making our lives in USA better.

However I would like to point out the major problems that is existing in current H1B system is the blatant treating by the ICC (indian consulting accompany), they blatantly make faked resume and brought in disqualified workers from India (in fact, according to one survey, right now around 86% of HIB visa were occupied by indians) these illegal actions have to stopped to make the HIB system work again, so that true talents shall stay in USA, while the lairs should be expelled!
