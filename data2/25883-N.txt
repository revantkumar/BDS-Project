I agree OPT for F1 students
The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit our country when they got an H1 or Green Card later. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is good for our country development in technology and science. Everybody knows USA has leading technology in the world and the contribution from the foreign students can not be underestimated. Moreover, there are quite a large amount of Engineering and Science student is USA college and university. If we do not give them working VISA, they come back to their country may be a threat to our country.
