I think, it's a great initiative to increase the time to help the students. I would really appreciate if USCIS passes the proposed bill to allow students for 24 months of stem opt extension. This bill would benefit thousands of students who are in immediate need of help. If the STEM OPT extension rule is given more time, it would be even more better. Thanks
