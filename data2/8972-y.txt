Ben Wright Wake up, America! We are in 21st century now and every nation in its right mind is fighting to get more scientists and technology talents to help build the nation. US used to lead the competition and thus prosper. And now we are training the best minds of the human kind and then send them back to Russia, India and China? 56 percent of the top 25 tech companies were founded by first or second generation American. We do not want the next google to be founded in China and next tesla in Russia, do we? But with the recent trend of possible ill treatment of the technology talents, that might happen in the near future. The Alibaba of China, with its vast pool of tech talents is now on its track to outpace Walmart to become the world's largest retailer and has already outperformed many US IT counterparts. What is even worse, they are now recruiting heavily with top dollars for the new tech talents just graduated from US elite universities. If we shut the door to the tech talents, they will just be warmly welcomed by our competitors!
