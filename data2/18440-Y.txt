Improving and expanding training opportunities will help United States to get the specialized services offered by STEM students which they have learnt at premier US universities. Not extending the training period will lead to migration of skilled students trained by US universities. After getting a good education at US universities and not paying it back what they got here will not help US economy in any way. Expanding OPT will be win win for both students and the United States to retain talents and get their services in STEM fields. In STEM field, there are not many skilled forces available at United States. It has nothing to do with domestic jobs because most of the jobs available for US citizens will see no impact. Rest of the jobs requires talents anyway be it US citizens or immigrants. Immigrants love this country as much any one else because the US has been great for it's openness towards a skilled and responsible immigrant.
