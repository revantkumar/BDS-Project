I strongly support this. This is beneficial for both international students who want to build their industrial experience before going back to their country, and the United states economic. Most students who are qualified for the extension are in the major of engineering, science, etc. The extension only applies to graduate students. Those students have strong technology knowledge and can work for technology companies. Technology today can help with improvement of the economy of the United States. Once the economy becomes better, there are usually a lot of job opportunities for American people. Thus, by working for those technology companies, those students actually could help the improvement of the economy and job opportunities.
