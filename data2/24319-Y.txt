I strongly support the new rule because this would allow the well educated foreign student body to contribute to the economy. I live in the Bay area, and have observed that the majority of the work force in the Silicon Valley comes from foreign nationals, and bringing the proposed rule in effect would greatly boost the strength skilled work force in the United States.

However, I would suggest the rule to provide an extension of 27 months instead of 24 so that students who graduate in the month of December can also get the benefit of the cap-gap extension.
