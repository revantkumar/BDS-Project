I very much support the new OPT extension rule, not only because I'm currently on OPT extension, but also for other good reasons as follows:

1. I'm an international student who graduated one year ago with a Mater degree and has been working for a high-tech company at silicon valley since graduation. My employer filed H1B application on my behalf but I wasn't chosen by the lottery, so without this new rule, I will literally lose my job and even my legal status in this country. But that is not only a disaster to me, there are tons of thousands people out there who are in the same situation. Most of us are making contributions to the high-tech industry and if all of us lose our jobs, it surely is a disaster to the high-tech industry. 

2. Few years back, when I decided to study abroad, I chose U.S. because I knew that I could get the best education resources and the opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in the industry for up to 29 month without changing F1 student status. If there was no OPT extension back then, I probably would have chosen Canada, which provides better post education employment permit for international students. I believe other students who want to study abroad take that into consideration too. This new OPT extension can keep U.S. attractive and hence bring top brains of the world, who can keep the academic level of U.S. the top. 

3. Regardless of how much contribution the international students can make after their graduation, we help the economy of U.S. even in school. We pay a higher tuition so that the universities are better founded. We book flight tickets; we rent; we buy gifts for family ; we boost the economy in many different ways. Imagine how many jobs are created for local U.S. citizens just because of us.
