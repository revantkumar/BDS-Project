If this rule is not passed, foreign STEM grads will take their skills and education to their home countries, costing America the opportunity for job-creating innovation. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A.
