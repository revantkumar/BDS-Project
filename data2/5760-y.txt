Phil Jordan As a native born American I do not understand why Homeland Security would be complicit in providing jobs to non-Americans. The loss of payroll tax revenue and other commercial taxes causes me to ask "What good is this law/regulation?" It has become some kind of trendy foolishness that enables non-American citizens to attain hiring priority over existing TAXPAYING citizens. I have been complaining for years about how the jobs were shifting out of America. I was one of the first Silicon Valley contacts of Dr. Norm Matloff at UC Davis sharing with him how H1-B (and programs like OPT) did so much harm to the software development workforce. This regulation just enables more of the thoughtless reduction of good paying jobs to people who do not have any allegiance to America. 
I am the T in STEM jobs, and I am tired of training my replacements, on-shore or off. The games played with H1-B and Lx visas, at the legislative and agency levels is shameful. Just goes to show how out-of-touch government is with most of the populace. Get out of Washington, DC., put down the faux analytics and see how these new regulations cause more problems. OR were you planning on GIVING voting rights to non-citizens? 

One further observation on this topic - does it pass the smell test of crony capitalism? Is this just so IBM,Apple, Oracle, Microsoft and Facebook can have cheaper on-shore workers? 

A vote for this regulation is a vote for more deficits as Social Security and other taxes are not paid.
