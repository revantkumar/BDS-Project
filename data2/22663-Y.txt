I strongly SUPPORT this new rule. As mentioned in the section '1.BENEFITS OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES', the diversity of different cultures is what makes US what it is now. The new rule making will further benefit and attract new international students coming to US. This is mutual advantage to both the parties i.e US and International students. International students can have a great opportunity of experiencing highly standard and innovative education while the US is benefited economically with a significant amount of around 25 billion$ every year on an average. Most of the public universities are benefited by international students who are paying considerable large tuition fee compared to instate students. This amount will help the universities to develop their infrastructure and there by helping to provide further high quality education to students in return. 
To move on, International students contribute a lot in research and development in various sectors. Several reports suggest that talented students of various countries who do not get opportunity utilize their in knowledge in their home country will likely move to a country which braces their innovative thinking and ground breaking talent. As a result several countries are developing good strategies to attract new talent. It is not surprising that, US is the nation which always strives to develop technologically by heart-fully welcoming students from various nations. This new rule will allow US to succeed in its effort to attract many international students and there by advancing technologically.
