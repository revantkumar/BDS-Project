I strongly support this new rule. I pursed a master of science degree in electrical engineering. One reason attracted me to study in the US is the OPT program(initial OPT plus STEM extension that is 36 months). Now if this STEM extension is revoked, the initial 12-months OPT doesn't sound attractive that much giving that one-year training experience is limited. My friends who are considering study electrical engineering in the US are extremely disappointed about the OPT STEM extension cancellation and they might not chose US university if OPT STEM extension is revoked. Think about the international students US is going to lose and the impact on economy. 

As for those who oppose to the rule,first, international STEM students and their American peers are competing job opportunities fairly. The fact is there aren't as many American STEM students as international STEM students so that merely American students cannot fill the gap of the job positions. International STEM students solves the scarce STEM assets issue in the US. If anything unfair about this competition, international students actually have more limitation than the US citizens because they are not considered in government or federal related fields. Second, US workers and international STEM students do not compete against each other because of field of the job they are seeking, their skillset and their capabilities are different. International STEM students at least need to earn an accredited degree in their related field. Usually it would take at least four years for a bachelor degree, or maybe more years for an advanced degree. 

In conclusion, this rule of extending OPT STEM will bring huge benefits for the US and international students hence I urge DHS carry out this rule before February 12, 2016 to avoid great disturbance.
