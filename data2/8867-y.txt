Feng Peng 24-month Opt Ext is primary for U.S, As far as I am concerned, most of students in this STEM, are from outside U.S. And amounts of facts are telling us, Reality left many of those high-tech companies in U.S no choice but must hire these International Students in STEM, cuz few citizens wouldn't like to have onerous, boring jobs like engineering and technology. Those International students complete the leadership of so many U.S high-tech companies on the world and significantly contribute to U.S's boom. So, how badly it would affect U.S economy , if there is no a 24-month OPT Ext , brilliant students would go somewhere else rather than come U.S for study, because they aren't having enough time, chances practicing and actually contributing in U.S. In that way, most of job opportunities would be taken by ICC companies, which hire a lot of persons, and those who don't even have authorized U.S degrees!
