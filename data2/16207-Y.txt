I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities to stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. American education is a profitable industry as well. Only by providing best service including OPT, can attract best students around globe to join American education and benefit both sides

2. Americ is a great immigrants country. If America refuse the well educated and trained students, they will have to come back to their own country, this will set more competitive competitors around the world for America. Diversity is very important for the U.S.

3. Competition does exist, but opt policy should take the blames. opt helps educated people and provide talents to create more companies and come up creative innovations which will help create more and more job opportunities in the future.
