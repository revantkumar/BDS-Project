Anna Berry Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. The additional OPT time will provide STEM graduates with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
