I am opposed to any action that would continue or expand the Optional Practical Training program. 

The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule would expand the Optional Practical Training program, allowing U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes. Not only does the program create an incentive for companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. 

With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. In particular, the proposed rule will:

- destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates,
- assault American middle class workers,
- increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands which will adversely affect job opportunities and wages, and
- provide significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.

It is disgraceful to continue to allow incentives that enable employers to utilize foreign students and displace Americans. I believe OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to get around limits on H-1B visas and will damage the US economy in the long run.
