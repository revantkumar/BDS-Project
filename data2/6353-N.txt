Expansion of the Optional Practical Training Program, which would allow foreign students to stay and work in the U.S. For three years after graduating, is bad policy.
Our American college grads do not need this additional competition from foreign grads who would be cheaper to hire, since the employers would not need to pay the 7.65 per cent payroll tax for them.
