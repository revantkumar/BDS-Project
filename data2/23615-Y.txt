I totally and strongly support this new rule. I just graduated with a master degree in Electrical Engineering in United States. The most important reason for me to study in America is that it could provide me the higher technology training opportunity. As a result, this OPT extension is very helpful and exciting for us international students to keep on staying the US and find a job and consequently make a big contribution to the development of technology in the US.
