I am in support of keeping the proposed rule of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. Some of the reasons am in support of this rule include:

1. The rule affects me as an international student as well and my aim after graduating with my degree is to gain valuable work experience to apply the educational experience gained in school in real life settings and the longer am able to acquire such experience, the better I would become in my chosen career.

2. The fact that it also allows for development and enhancement of the skills of the F-1 students through practical applications of the knowledge related to what they have studied in school is also an added advantage of keeping the rule.

3. Most importantly, the diverse backgrounds and different thoughtful approaches that F-1 students contribute to their different workplaces after gaining education from the nation's colleges and universities can only help to strengthen the different aspects and sectors of the United States economy.

It is my believe that my comments like many other comments from different supporters of this rule would convince law makers to ratify this rule into law as soon as possible.
