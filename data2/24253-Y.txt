The US is an immigrant country. OPT and OPT extension is beneficial to keep the international talents and fill the gap of the STEM worker need. As a student with OPT, I am paying the tax, the insurance, and contributing to the charity. My major is in Environmental Fluid Mechanics and very few US citizens have the expertise to do my work, such as analyzing the pollution dispersion and creating models to predict the impact of climate change, so I am not completing with the wide labors of the US for jobs.
