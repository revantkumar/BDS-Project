I agree with the Customs and Enforcement Bureau, extending the OPT form for STEM students from 17 to 24 months would be more than beneficial. As a foreigner myself, I believe that it is unfair that within a university, all students are held up to the same standards - we all have to take the same classes, pass the same tests, with the same grades, therefore we end up graduating with the same degree - yet after graduation there is a huge separation between foreigners and American students. While both parties were held accountable for the same information, the American graduates have an advantage while trying to employ their degrees.

Only one of these factors is the time limit given to immigrants through their OPT form. While I agree that 24 months of legal employment in the United States would greatly increase the chances of an immigrant graduate to find the job of their dreams, it would not change the fact that there is still a huge advantage to Americans. However, this is a good first step. And realizing the unfair situation the government is putting capable, hard-working, smart, but unfortunately non-American students, will hopefully one day lead to a perfect, globalized environment, where employers hire people based on their abilities, rather than the language of their Passports.
