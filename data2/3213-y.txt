Stella Song It is really hard to find a position which could be in responsible for what we have learned. The first months is really hard. Usually what we could do is just assistant, technician, sales or something unrelated. If we are lucky, after a period of hardworking, we may finally get a chance to do what we should do related to our major. However, it may take almost a year.Certainly we no longer get a further opportunity since the time is done. It's not fair at all since the difference of major contributes to the difference of career life. 

So I really wanna the extension could successfully pass. Please please please, we really need the chance to apply what we have learned.
