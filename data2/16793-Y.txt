OPT extension will definitely be a right desicison. There are tons of foreign STEM students graduate from US University year by year. Most of them want to stay and use their knowledge for this country. However, they have to go back to their home due to be lack of one more chance of getting a H1B visa. 

Loss of these students isn't a good thing for US. If US government can even accept those illegal Mexican person who has been in US for years, why can't you give more chances to those person who can really make US a better country?! STEM students are highly educated and skillful people who can make a contribution to US in a more professional way. Someone may believe they steal the jobs from US citizen, but to be honest of you, by the time they have to leave US because of H1B, they already "steal" jobs and being trained workers in either companies or any other facilities.

Then, they have to leave now. 

Sure, you are thinking this can give the job opportunities back to US citizens, but we cannot take back our Human source and material sources used to train a highly professional and skillful person. We discard them when they are finally good for their jobs! This is definitely not good for our country, not even saying we are allowing those Mexicans who can only do low level jobs to stay in US for years.

If we are afraid that foreigners take too much benefit from our country, instead of trying our best to kick out a useful people, don't we consider illegal immigrators first!? Or, maybe we should not give them any chance to stay in US after they graduate from university as a master or even a PhD. Just let them go once they graduate. Do you think it will be better for US? The answer must be negative.

Give more chances for those F1 students, our country could be better!
