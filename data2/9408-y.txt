Yuheng Cai I strongly support the OPT extension rule considering this is a win-win strategy, for both international students and United State.

There are some US citizens who claim that the 24 month OPT extension will dramatically decrease the jobs available for them. But the truth is extending OPT from 1 year to 3 years will not directly increase the rate of the students who get offers. Let us assume there are 100,000 international STEM students every year. Without OPT STEM extension, 50,000 of them will get offers. One year later, they have to leave the US. But new 50,000 STEM students will take over their jobs. Extending the OPT to 3 years will not bump up the employed international students to 150,000 every year. It surely gives the old students opportunities to stay. But, at the meantime, the new students will have to compete with these old students with one-year work experience. Some of them may be extremely outstanding that can take the jobs from the old students or get new jobs from other places. But the number will certainly not be another 50,000. That is the reason why OPT extension will not change the employed international students number dramatically, not with just a simple multiplication at least.
From another perspective, 1 year OPT will force old students to leave and the employers will have to spend more time and funds on training new employees. Or the companies will have to hire someone less qualified than who they truly want. Either of them will obviously reduce the competitiveness of the US companies. 

Competition is a magical thing that individuals intuitively want to eliminate while the community will benefit from it. At the beginning, it will make people suffer for a while. But, then they will have to come out from their comfort zone and challenge themselves to achieve higher goals. Eventually, competition is the driving force to a brighter future for the society and the people in this society.
