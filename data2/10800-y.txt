Julian D. I support the proposal.

Student that got their degrees in US consume valuable education resources, they should also make contribute to US.

Also, the opinion that they will compete job opportunity with US people is not persuading, because:
1. 24 month is just 2 years, not permanent.
2. It is necrssary to understand "US people" correctly, don't forget US is based on high quality immigrants. These STEM students, are important (if not the most important) candidates of high quality immigrants. If they are outstanding enough, we should give them opportunities to become US people, but not let them go back to other countries which are completing US.
