I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I'm an international Ph.D student majoring statistics. The OPT extension rule is very important for attracting foreign talents, which is also one key factor I considered when I decided to pursue my Ph.D degree in US. Also, I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is more suitable for OPT program for STEM students. Based on my own research experience with clinical trial data, a complete data analysis typically requires 2-3 years. I also worked at SAS on developing solutions for predicting energy, and such an industrial project also requires at least 2 years of development, since we need spend time on connecting with customers, developing statistical methods, testing and coding. Therefore, this new OPT rule would benefit US pharmaceutical and high-tech industry considering number of international STEM talents who contribute to these companies with their knowledge and creativity.
