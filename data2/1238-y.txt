Simon Johnson I can't agree more on the proposal of OPT improvement as an Assistant Professor in economy. It is tempting to speculate the potential harms over citizens. But in fact, such untenable arguments come from ignorance.

Job market won't be competitive as many negative comments address. Overall prosperity of economy has countless benefits for the country and its citizens. 

The opponents are massive but provide no evidences in supporting their arguments. They are worried about the job competition over citizens while ignoring that OPT Expanding is only beneficial for students in STEM areas where a large vacant positions require candidates. 

According to the research conducted in the paper "The Impact of Skilled Foreign Workers on Firms: an Investigation of Publicly Traded U.S. Firms", quantitive analysis of positive benefits shows it is definitely a wise choice for productivity and prosperity of U.S. economy which will benefit native job seekers in return.

Ignorance and unnecessary worries of the opponents should not be in the way of this sagacious proposal.
