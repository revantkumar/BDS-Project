Why cant the Obama administration put americans first on there agendas.Why cant we work for American prosperity and growth in our country.the list is endless.why cant the senate and the house of representatives work for the betterment of americans.Americans vote these people in office.when will they represent us.This country is a country of immigrants.But allowing special treatment for iimigrants while throwing our citizens under the bus is just plain wrong.
