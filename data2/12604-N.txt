I oppose the Dept. of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.
The intent of the Optional Practical Training program was/ is to provide foreign students with on-the-job training lasting 12 to 29 months in specific fields of study that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. 
The proposed rule will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This allows U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay.
This change MUST be the result of tech industry lobbying, because the U.S. already has an abundant number of STEM skilled citizens from college graduates to 50 something highly skilled innovators.
This change smacks of the usual greedy drive to keep payrolls as low as possible for the very workers who invent, design and make the products that enrich those businesses and their investors. Of course, this is always helped by laws written by lobbyists hired with the profits not shared with such workers, and used to ensure those lobbyists are allowed to write drafts of laws and regulations that ensure no new start up companies get the same level playing field they had as they grew. And it guarantees that American STEM graduates continue to be unemployed as foreign F-1 Visa students are given those jobs...in direct violation of the Visa's intent that they return home with those skills.
It is this type of crony favoritism that so corruptly attacks the well-being of the nation's citizens in every field dominated by corporate greed for ever higher profits on declining quality of products and services while ensuring citizens are robbed of the ability to be hired based on honest comparison of skill.
