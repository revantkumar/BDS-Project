Esther Garvett I am in favor of extending the visas for immigrant students that are studying in the United States. It is good for the students and good for the United States. These students become our best ambassadors when they have an opportunity to learn about the United Staes, our citizens, our way of life, and our values. Please allowed them to extend these visas.
