I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer science master student from China. The most important reason that I choose US colleges as my first choice when I applied for graduate school is that US provide STEM major students good opportunities to apply their knowledge and experience in industry and tech companies. OPT and OPT extension rule is a huge part of this policy. Without it those high tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and so on, would suffer a huge loss in foreign talents. That's not wise at all.
