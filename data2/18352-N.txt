Why is it the government is backing programs that allow US companies to NOT hire qualified American workers and, offer these companies tax breaks to do so? This is just another way Obama and his cohorts "sell us out".....AGAIN! When we should be investing in America for Americans! Not to mention the security concerns. Why allow possible terrorists to legally enter our country and set up shop? Is it so difficult to see how much this hurts Americans? It's far beyond time OUR GOVERNMENT made decisions strictly based on OUR people and OUR economic developement! ANY COMPANIES that seek to better their bottom line at the expense of OUR PEOPLE should pay HIGHER TAXES based on the number of foreign workers on work visas. 

We used to be THE ECONOMIC EXAMPLE other countries looked up to. Now, we are the laughing stock for SOFT GOVERNMENT because we continue to allow these poor decisions to put other countries and people's over OUR OWN PEOPLE! I wonder when OUR GOVERNMENT will stop SELLING US OUT for the benefit of foreign people? I feel sure, with the number aged congressmen and senators, the phrase "Charity begins at home" has meaning. Help OUR PEOPLE FIRST! Then, and only then, should we seek to "give" to other countries! We need a "Government of the people, by the people and for the people"! Not a Government of the government, by the government and for the government! Stop the chronyism!! Members of the government that make decisions based on THEIR monitory gains from outside interests need to be revealed and relieved of their duties! 

It is far past time that OUR GOVERNMENT work for US! Not for THEMSELVES or THEIR PET PROGRAMS!
