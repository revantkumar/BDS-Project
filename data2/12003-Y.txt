I definitely support this OPT extension proposal. US prides itself to be the most diversified country in the world, and it is part of the friendly immigration policy that makes this come true. Moreover, nobody can deny the contribution that the immigrants have made to this country.Someone uses the domestic unemployment rates as the reason why we need to against this, but how we could tag US as a country where everyone has the equal opportunity to chase the American dream, while at the same time busy pushing immigrants away? I think whoever is capable deserves a good job, and this could define what is so called democracy and fairness, on this free land.
