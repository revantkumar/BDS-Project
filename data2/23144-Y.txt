Just one more thing to add on. This is my personal story happened 2 weeks ago. I interviewed with one of the Big Four for a full time position in IT Advisory practice. They had good feedback on me and I really like the company. But at the end of the day the company was not able to offer me the position because they have reached their H1B sponsorship quota. If non-immigrant students can be offered a longer period for their training opportunities and even larger cap for H1B visa, companies might adjust their policy to loose their constraint of hiring outstanding non-immigrant students.
