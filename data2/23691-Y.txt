I strongly support this proposed rule.
Foreign students pays a lot of money to come to USA to learn advanced technology and knowledge. After the knowledge gained, they should have enough time to practice and also contribute to the USA industry. Everyone should have equal opportunity in jobs and a job position should be taken by who has the most satisfied skills. Usually foreign students are pursuing higher education and job positions needs creativity and passion. This will promote the US industry and technology.
