I strongly support the OPT extension proposal for the reasons below:

(1) International graduated students are great resource for technology companies in the US, they are qualified candidates for various position provided by these companies. And they can definitely contribute great effort to the growth of these companies, and furthermore United States.

(2) Diversity is very important for United States and diversity can be fulfilled through the OPT extension.

(3) I agree that OPT extension will bring competition for Americans, but this kind of competition is motivation for all of us to work hard and improve ourselves.
