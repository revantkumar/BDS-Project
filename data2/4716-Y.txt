I support the proposal:

1. International students add billions to the U.S economy. If this proposal is not approved, there will be less and less international students coming to the U.S, which will be a disaster for many universities, schools, the economy around the area of the school(Car industry, Housing industry, retail industry, etc) And even bigger loss when some of these students could become the important person in STEM, and contribute to the whole country. It is easily seen that there are many international faces of professors in the universities like MIT, Stanford, and so on. Most of them were international students in the U.S. Also in the industry of energy, Internet, there are many great international people working to give huge benefits to the country.

2. International students are good competitors to U.S local students. There are studies showing that the existence of international students can benefit the U.S classmates, (http://today.duke.edu/2013/06/internationalengage)make us the U.S students have a global view and increase our interests in STEM majors. Even when they go to work it will be a great benefits to the colleges and gain more benefits together.
