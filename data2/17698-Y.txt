I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1.International students can only find the job, if the job is proved that most of the citizens cannot do this work. So there is no relationship between the opportunity given to foreign students and the unemployment conditions in US.
2.What's more, brilliant international students also can build start-up company, which provide job offers for the people in America. So the opt extension not only will not shorten the chance for citizens to find job, but also provide jobs to them. When the start-up is found by the government, to some degree, it means that more and more jobs are offered to citizen.
3. As we all know that, if the company pay 50k for you one year, it means that you created more than 100k for the company. The extension for opt for international students just means that they can build more accomplishment to US, those kind of money is also can be used to donate to the poor and rise the financial aid to the unemployed. If you cut down the work for the international students, the poor will have to work to survive, also, the money from the taxes will be cut down too.
