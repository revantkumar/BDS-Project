Jordan Andou I feel delighted for this new rule, not only because it is good news for the international students but also it will benefit the engineering field. 
More and more international students choose America as the ideal place to pursue their degrees since America is not only the most powerful country but also provides the best chances for them to practice after graduation. In Japan, the software field is not viewed as important as it is in US. In contrast, tech companys role is obvious here. Frankly speaking, direct revocation would be unreasonable since US will lose its unique attraction to students. Then what will happen if the amount of foreign students severely decrease? University will definitely lose huge amount of fund since the expected tuition form foreigners disappear. Companies will face few candidates when trying to hire new graduates since the majority of STEM students are foreigners. Even more, the businesses stimulated by the foreigners like Asian restaurants, renting companies will suddenly shrink since they lose their customers. All this will be a strike to US I believe. 
Besides, the rule almost has no influence on American citizens. The rule itself does not require anything from Americans, contrarily, the foreigners in OPT extension status contribute to the technology development, pay taxes to local government. The only concern may be the influence on the job opportunity for the local. However, the fact is the job seekers in STEM fields are always the foreigners! From employers prospective, they would like to hire citizens since they do not need to consider the foreigners visa problem. Even in this situation, the employers inevitably interview lots of foreigners, the reason can only be that there are too many positions for the citizens to fill in.
After all, I am on the side of the new OPT extension.
