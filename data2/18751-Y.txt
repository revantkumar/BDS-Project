I'm highly agree and support with the expanding optional practice training for the international student. More highly educated people come into America market. It bring more energy to America market and society. it s good for America economy. America is a country that is equal to everyone, it allows anybody success here or failure here no matter what country and what color the people is. It's America's characteristics.
