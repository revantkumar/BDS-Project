Zhenhao Ge Hiring people by skills rather than by nationalities will ensure companies to find the best candidates who can maximize their profit and eventually straighten the company for more job opportunities for others. 

I strongly agree with the proposed rule and hope all American can benefit from it by living in a better country managing in better hands. I understand for individuals, no matter citizen or non-citizen, they may lose their job, since the company can find a better alternative. However, I accept that since it should be a better solution for company or country. I am willing to pass my job to anyone who is more qualified than me, no matter he/she is citizen or non-citizen.
