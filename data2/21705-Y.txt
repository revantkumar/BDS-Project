After over 200 years of welcoming immigrants into this country, the U.S. is now telling the best immigrants to go away because they cannot obtain a valid VISA. By now, the value of immigrant entrepreneurs to the U.S. economy is beyond doubt. But the appeal of the United States as an immigrant business incubator may be slipping away. A new study co-authored by Wadhwa and released by the Kauffman Foundation shows that the proportion of immigrant-founded companies nationwide has slipped from 25.3% to 24.3% since 2005, and in Silicon Valley, the percentage of immigrant-founded startups declined from 52.4% to 43.9% during that time. This is the wrong direction.

For several years, anecdotal evidence has suggested that an unwelcoming immigration system and environment in the U.S. has created a 'reverse brain drain.' To maintain a dynamic economy, the U.S. needs to embrace immigrant entrepreneurs. According to the study, immigrant founders are most likely to start companies in the "innovation/manufacturing-related services (45%) and software (22%) industries," and employed some 560,000 workers nationwide. These companies generated an estimated $63 billion in sales from 2006 to 2012, the study found.

The neglected state of U.S. immigration policy has created a situation where we are kicking highly skilled workers out of the country before they've had a chance to fully realize their promise in America. The U.S. grants tens of thousands of education and work visas to skilled-immigrants every year, but because of arbitrary caps, the demand and need for such visas has now out-stripped supply. We bring people in as students, we bring them in to work for American companies, but we won't let them stay beyond a short period of time. 

So the new rule of OPT can help solving this serious problem.
