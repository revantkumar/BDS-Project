The proposed rule is a no-brainer for national interest. The United States has the best higher education system in the world, which attracts top talents from many other countries - mostly paying higher tuition out of pockets. It would be a shame if we cannot keep the very best of them here and instead push them back to China, India, Russia, South Korea, and other countries that are trying to lure them back. If one takes a look at the percentage of foreign-born scientists and engineers that contributed to the Manhattan Project, Apollo 11, and the technology advancements in the past decades, think about what would be the consequences to the US if the next big things happen elsewhere. 

In addition, while tens of millions of illegal immigrants were allowed to stay in the country as deportation enforcement has been a completely joke, is it fair to deny these tens of thousands of foreign students a chance to have more training in the US and possibly immigrate to the US later, considering that they entered this country legally, followed every possible law and regulation, paid tens of thousands of dollars in tuition every year (that may support your jobs), and paid every dime of tax that owed to Uncle Sam (that may help support your social security in the years to come)?
