The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.
The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers.
Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.
OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.
Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.
OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.
OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.
It is hard enough for college graduates to find work in the STEM system as it is. Don't give away our jobs to other countries that don't support us. By allowing them to hire foreign workers and to not pay taxes on them because they are "students" is a slap at all Americans and American students.
