We have a lot of un and underemployed American citizens that need these jobs. Don't you think it's about time to put our citizens first for a change. Please start putting our citizens to work before looking to immigrants for these positions. Americans are tired of the constant government practice of taking from us to give to everyone else. Take care of our own first.
