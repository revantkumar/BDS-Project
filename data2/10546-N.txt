It is outrageous that this program would even be considered. American citizens should always be considered for any job in America over non citizens first. I would expect it to be that way in any country. 
With everything foolish that is happening right now in America, this would be just one more mistake; please re consider this program that would honor our citizens and allow them to have the jobs after graduation instead of handing them over to non citizens.
Sincerely,
