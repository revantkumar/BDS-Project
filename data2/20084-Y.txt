When heard the news about the cancellation of OPT extension, I and other international students who plan to go to America to study further feel scared.I am a master student graduating next year and plan to pursue PhD in America.

One year is too short a time period for graduated to get into a job.This news would make U.S. lose many talented people. The students that work during OPT program could make big contribution to the America companies.If the OPT extension is cancelled,many students would come back to their home country and in some ways, American will lose competition with countries such as Canada or German
