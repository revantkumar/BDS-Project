I am amazed that our government is initiating rules that favor foreigners over our own citizens. When did it become a 
government of the foreigners, by the foreigners and for the foreigners? Incidentally, I already know the answer to that question
and I'm hoping that we might regain our sanity before we destroy ourselves. They say that charity begins at home, so why 
don't we give that a try, and begin to provide jobs for our own children, instead of giving them away to foreigners.
