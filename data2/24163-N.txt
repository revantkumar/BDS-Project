Any open position that can not be filled with an American worker must first advertised prolifically for at least one year before any attempt to hire a foreign person that does not already have a green card and a working permit for the whole duration of the proposed position. Also any foreign person who is qualified must be evaluated by congress as well as any agency of the administration.
