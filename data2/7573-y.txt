Damon Roosevelt I do strongly SUPPORT this proposal for some reasons,

The economy of the states is bad and now is being supposed by China and other developing countries, so the government should really need students who learned knowledge in the country and keep them to contribute to the US, especially when talk about science and technology we are talking about future, more important ,competition is always a good thing for the development of a society and a nation.
