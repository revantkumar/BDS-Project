Optional Practical Training for foreign STEM graduates is an extremely important way for the US economy to stay competitive. First of all, a significant number of students in US colleges pursuing STEM degrees are international students. In fact, majority of graduate students in STEM fields are international. They are able to utilize their education and training to advance the technological development in the US. This in turn will boost the US economy, creating more job opportunities in the related field such as manufacturing. If these international students return to their home country for work after their studies, it is evident that they will take advantage of their US education to advance the technological development in THEIR HOME COUNTRY instead of the US, and subsequently bringing more business opportunities away from the US to their home country. Having a short (1-year) OPT will make it very hard for US companies to employ these foreign STEM talents because of the possibility of losing them during important projects. By having an extended OPT, US companies will be able to better utilize the expertise of these foreign STEM graduates to achieve the individual goals of these US companies, in turn bringing more business opportunities to the US and creating a dynamic economy and generating more job opportunities for Americans.
