Students need more opportunities to get their skills trained and help our society get more bustling and developed. F-1 nonimmigrant students can contribute a lot to the fields that they are focus on and help to build up diversification. As a result, I highly recommend we should improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with stem degrees.
