I oppose the passage of this bill. I now have 2 young grandchildren and worry that they will never find good jobs because the jobs will be going to foreign students. American schools are just beginning to expand their STEM studies. What good will those efforts do if the US government will allow foreign workers with STEM degrees to come to this country and take STEM jobs? It doesn't make good sense.
