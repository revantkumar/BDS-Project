I strongly SUPPORT the proposed rule. As a scientist in a research university, I have met and worked with a large number of international researchers who have made great contributions to advancing our nation's scientific research when holding a OPT extension status. 

These people are hard-working and smart enough to be accepted into our nation's higher education programs in the first place. Upon finishing up their education, they often want to practice in their STEM fields in US for a period of time first (no matter becoming a US citizen or not later on). These fresh international graduates are often highly-motivated and smart and have been an important part of the workforce in my research university. Turning down this proposed rule will make the nation lose these highly valuable minds and potentially harm thousands of projects they have been or will be involved in. Moreover, these genius going to other countries that provide them better job opportunities will strength STEM fields in those countries and threat US's leading role in STEM around the world.

A lot of my friends are US citizens. They have never thought giving STEM students extended OPT is a threat to their job opportunities. Most of them are hard-working and smart as well, and they support fair competition from international STEM workers and enjoy the energy, brilliance, and diversity international STEM workers have brought to their institutions.
