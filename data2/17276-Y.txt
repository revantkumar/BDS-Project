I believe everyone deserves a chance, if obtained following all the necessary steps that are required and expected by the individual.

STEM students have obtained their legal right to be here to further their education. Shouldn't they be given a chance to find a job here as well? For them to be in this country, there would be more opportunities for them. Not only do they benefit from our countries economy, We in turn also benefit. The world is moving towards a more mature age of technology, more STEM students would be beneficial for us in the future. Helping our economy grow and be more stable.
