I oppose this proposed rule as it effectively takes US jobs from US citizens and gives them to non-US citizens. 
Such a step, leading as it does to increased unemployment, is hardly a sensible one for improving the US economy. 
What are the US citizens supposed to do, go and find jobs in other countries? I don't think so. Those other countries wouldn't 
be silly enough to place foreigners ahead of their own citizens purely to serve the self interest of corporations who clearly 
have no interest in good citizenship. Remember, we have a lethargic, weak economy by any estimation, as evidenced by 
companies like QUALCOMM and Microsoft planning to lay off significant numbers of workers in the coming year - 4,500 and
7,500 respectively are the numbers of jobs each is planning to shed. I'm not against foreigners, I'm against a government's 
misguided, damaging policies that will hurt its own citizens, primarily younger, graduating college students with STEM 
degrees. Plainly, this is government against the people it is supposed to serve.
