I support the rule. Diversity and technology is why US is the most powerful country in the world and OPT STEM extension brings both. However, it should be ensured that STEM students are paid the same amount as American workers to prevent possible abuse. Furthermore, it might be beneficial to distinguish between the education levels of STEM students. A researcher with a PhD degree may require more time in his/her training to achieve a high level contribution compared to a recent college graduate who works as a software engineer.
