Why Hire F-1 Students?
Most college graduates leave in less than two years. F-1 students who want permanent residence must stay seven to twelve years.
Employers have almost no liability at any step in the process. The F-1 student takes every risk, the company will complete the "green card" process.
The out of pocket cost for this process is almost zero when compared to retention of a qualified, highly motivated employee for seven to twelve years.

Guys, please do not do this to US citizens and residents.
