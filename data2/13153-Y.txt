It is shortsighted to say that the foreign students are taken away the job opportunities from US citizens. They are not taken away the job; they are putting their effort to building US, making everyones life better. Like Bill Gates has not taken away our money, he is creating wealth --the Microsoft --for us. Anyway, we are accepting immigrates for all kinds of reasons, like refugees or even past illegal immigrates. why not giving these young talented students an opportunity to work for us? We actually WANT these technical guys!!!
