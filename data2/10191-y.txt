Jeanie Cain I vehemently oppose this. It is obvious that foreign students have been encouraged to flood you with comments of support - I can see why they would. America being suckered yet again. it is American taxpayers who should be consulted as it is our money, our security, the future of our grandchildren that is at stake. With unemployment at it's present level (real numbers, not the massaged ones we get on the nightly news), this is not the time to be worrying about "helping" other countries while ignoring our own youth. This program is in violation of Congressional intent in that it is shadowing H-1B; it is inefficient and fraudulent in nature. We are currently being swamped with 'students' who overstay their visas and may well be a threat to the security of this country; or at the very least taking jobs that American youth should be selected for. This program should be deep sixed before it gets off the drawing board.
