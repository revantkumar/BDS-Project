As a international student, I deem, it is necessary and fair to extend OPT period. It is less likely that the employer could hire the employees who do not have the specific skills. So internal students have to find the job which is suitable for their majors. And when we study in US. We are also the tax payers owing to we consume every day. So I think that it is fair for us to extend the OPT period. Thank you
