I STRONGLY support this policy. This policy allows America have more chances to keep the international STEM degree holders in the country. First of all, US is an immigration country who has been benefiting from immigrating people from all over the world which is self-evidenced. Secondly, considering the difficulty of successfully being admitted to and finishing in the STEM majors from American universities from a different country, the STEM major degree holders are part of the smartest people in the world whom US should try best to keep as long as possible instead of abandoning. Thirdly, the STEM major degree holders make the critical contribution to create more total fortune of the society and in the same time generate more job opportunities. Fourthly, a lot of the jobs filled by the international STEM major degree holders are actually the ones those the US citizenship or PR holders DO NOT want to do.
