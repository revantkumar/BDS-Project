This should be supported for a couple of reasons:

1. United States as a country has been formed by people from different other countries. Equal rights and freedom have always been a crucial part of the American spirits. I do not understand why people are angry about others getting job just because they are of different nationality.

2. The contribution that talented students made here can create huge fortune and opportunity for US. There are not just limited number of jobs available.
