I firmly support that OPT STEM extension should continue since it both benefit the US and the STEM students.

US economy have been going down for a while and the STEM students are highly educated and specialized talents, they are equipped with high technology and will generate tremendous value for US. Nowadays, it is science and technology which leads the world and decide the the future of the country. Therefore, obtaining talents is obtaining productive forces. 

Another perspective is, most of STEM students were well educated in their own country, and come to US to get further education, therefore, US get high quality talents without investing a lot in their education. It is really a good deal. It is worth to extend the OPT and get more talents staying in the country to contribute to the technology and transfer to GDP.

For the students, OPT extension provide them time for getting internship, to further trained their skills in work, to contribute to the US economy, and also benefit themselves as gaining experience. If we don't extend OPT, they will easily go back to their own country, and that will be a huge loss for US.

It is argument that E-verify is helpful in regulating the employment process, but in fact, only very few companies are E-verified, this requirement make the OPT extension much less useful, even with extension, very few companies are qualified for STEM extension, and this make the extension void. To make the biggest value of the regulation, I strongly suggest that E-verify is not linked with extension, but US can mandatory require every company join E-verify, so it will not become a limitation for STEM students, but as a whole foster a more standard way for US employer.
