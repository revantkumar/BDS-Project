I fully support the STEM program for three reasons:
1. America is a country of immigation, and it is the immigrants that make this country success and prosper energetically. American dream deeply rooted in everyone's heart, and without this I think America is not America anymore.
2. Considering the potential immigrants from the STEM program, they have high level of education, receive their master or even phd degrees in American university, which means high quality and high future production and contribution to this country. How can Americans let these people go away? 
3. Imagine what the world will be like after 100 years or 200 years, will our world still be divided into different nations, probably not. As the extent globalization increases, the difference between people in different regions become more and more similar to each other. People learning each other' language, enjoy the same genre of music, and use the same intanationally manufractured iphones. As you dig deeper, you will see more and more thia kind of similarities. Now America is the first country facing the immgration issue on a legal level, sooner or later, the whole world will encountor this chanllenge. As in the 2nd and 3rd Industralization, in this enormous social revolution, what role should Americans take? A leader or a outmoded one? The choicr is in yout hand. Being openminded and brace the world,!
