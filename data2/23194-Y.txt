I strongly advocate this proposal for 3 reasons. First, those students with STEM degrees especially Masters and Ph.D are very diligent and talented, we should provided good circumstances for them to make great contribution to US. If the proposal will bring much benefits to the country's well being, why should we work all the way to prevent it? Second, STEM(science, technology, engineering and maths ) is an area where international students account for large portion. According to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Securities Investigations, of all the international students, more than one-third (35 percent) are pursuing degrees in STEM fields. Rejecting students in these fields would undoubtedly cause elite decline, which is really an catastrophe for the companies and universities. Third, as the economy develops, many country struggles to attract more talents to build the country's prosperity. For example, many universities in China are having special plans for oversea graduate students, including high salary, good research platforms and housing condition,etc. There is growing number of students who would like to go back to their own coun tries. In order to attract these elites, we need to extend the OPT period.
