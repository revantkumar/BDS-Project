The American people are sick and tired of a government that favors non citizens over tax paying citizens. Again, we are being sold out to fulfill the economic desires of the tech industry and the 1%. This is a bad deal and favors business while pitting workers against each other in a race to the bottom. I am so very tired of the government and big business colluding to screw over workers. So disgusted that I am looking for a new country to call home. Boehner finally leaves but is replaced by the equally noxious Ryan. It is no wonder Trump is so popular. We need change but I doubt it will be of the kind that will be of benefit to American citizens.
