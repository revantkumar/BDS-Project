I strongly support OPT extension regulation. 
I'm studying at Columbia University in STEM subjects. From the observation of me and lots of my friends among almost 100 American universities, there are only a few American students major in STEM. And American STEM students can get a decent job with less hard-working than foreign students due to their excellent expression and communication ability. And most of the companies prefer to hire natives since they don't have the ability to sponsor visa. On the other hand, STEM foreign students are not allowed to work in fields other than STEM during OPT. So this regulation will not harm the right to gain a good job for native Americans. On there contrary, it will boost the development of American economy, science and engineering.
