New OPT extension rule is good for the research of US universities, because a lot of post doctor hold OPT visa. New OPT extension rule provide them three years to finish the research. If new OPT extension is failed, then the OPT is only one year. It is too short for most of research, because most of research need two or more years. It will cause disaster for a lot of research projects in US universities.
