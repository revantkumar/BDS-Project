I strongly support this.

If you do a research, almost in all graduate schools in STEM across US, international students are far more the majority. For example, in the computer science department, the portion of international students can be more than 90%. Those international students have contributed so much in U.S. Technologies and economics. This is also a major reason why U.S. can be lead in the world's technology today. 

1 For short term:
Big IT companies rely on so much on international students. Americans who can do the work are far from enough. If the OPT extension is gone, there will be a disaster for those companies. And the direct effect would be that, those companies have to outsource their work to workers in other countries. This would be a great loss of the tax income of U.S.

Besides, losing those talented international students will make our current big IT companies less competitive. Since the internet is an open world, they will be quickly replaced by their competitors in other countries. For example, China already has some big IT companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, etc. If we lose our talents, we will die soon. As technology companies contribute so much in the US economy, it will have a consequential effect on all economic systems in U.S. Possiblely cause another big depression. Then we cannot imagine how many Americans will lose jobs.

2. For long term:
If we do not give an OPT extension for those STEM students, they would choose some other countries such as European countries to do graduate research. This, in the long term, U.S. won't be a lead country in both technology and economics.

After all, U.S. is an open country that accepts all who love this country and would do contribution to this country.
