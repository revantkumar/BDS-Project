I strongly SUPPORT this OPT policy! As a freshly graduated PhD student, being able to continue my new job in data science area is both important for me and the company before I get my H1B visa. There are not many people available in this area especially in Michigan. Without these foreign students like me working on engineering ares, the economy of US will be delayed. 

We are trying our best to contribute to this great country. Please support us!
