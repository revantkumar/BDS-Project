I support the new rule of 24-month OPT extension, and sincerely believe that more people should support the new action.

First of all, while some people could argue that OPT extension could result in more immigrants in US, which might cause employment or other social resources issues, the benefit of international students is far more than the drawbacks. US higher education and research institutions can definitely benefit from international students both financially and intellectually, as they contributed a large portion of tuition fees and other sources of research funds, and they participated in all sorts of scientific researches, which would potentially benefit everybody.

Secondly, it is necessary to adjust the OPT extension period to 24 months so that the benefits stated above because a 24-month OPT extension is a powerful attraction to students who would consider studying abroad, and practically, a research or corporate project would last for at least 2 to 3 years to see the final effect, thus 24-month extension would be reasonable for international students participating in those projects.
