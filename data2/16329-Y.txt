I strongly support OPT extension. This provides an equal opportunity to everybody in America. America is a country of immigrants, and has been always welcoming immigrants, this should never be stopped. Immigrants have been bringing a lot of values to this country, they have been helping US economy development.

Many opponents are against this proposal without a good or even valid reason. Some examples are:

"I am against expanding training opportunities for F-1, International students. Jobs should be given to U.S stem workers & American students seeking stem careers." - This is terribly wrong. This proposal does not imply jobs will be given to foreigners instead of Americans. It just gives them an equal opportunity, which they well deserve for their hard work.

"STEM workers in this country are being laid off and replaced with H1B immigrants" - Again terribly wrong. Many OPT and H1B workers are being laid off as well. While it's unfortunate, it's fair between foreigners and Americans.
