I continue to be disappointed with our governments assault on the middle class, and the American workers. We have an untold number of Americans out of work, downsized, or just plain replaced by cheaper foreign workers, and in some cases by illegals.

You continue to increase immigration, and pick and choose which laws you want to enforce as related to immigration. I think you need to remember that this is the United States of America and you are paid with American taxpayer money, not money that is sent back overseas as soon as it's earned.

We need more programs to get Americans back to work and strengthen our middle-class and not turn this country into a low-wage Third World country. What we don't need is a plan to import more foreign workers until American workers are back to work.
