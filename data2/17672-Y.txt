Don't just think about jobs or other people steal something from you on this...thinking about if your children are abroad, exploring themselves, and they found something that they would love to do, don't you think it's fair to give them more time to be employed? 

Authorizing the STEM 24 months is just extending it from 17 months to 24 months. Extending 7 more months would not influence most people but would have a huge impact on the young and hard working students. Please authorize the rule!!!
