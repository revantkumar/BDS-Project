This proposed rule would be a good way to prevent the losing of US education resources and guiding more STEM foreign student into the development of U.S. high-tech industries. Every year the U.S. education system shared a considerable part of education resource to train these foreign students. Now instead of sending these students back to their country, why don't let the best of them stay and serve in the US industry system so this portion of resource used on foreign students could be turned into the force that push U.S. economy forward.
