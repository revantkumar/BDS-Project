IT IS GOOD TO HAVE NEW OPT EXTENSION. I am currently working in Deloitte and our national team is a relatively small team which is made up with 40 person or so. Besides, majority of the new hire or experienced ones are international students.You can imaging that if the OPT EXTENSION is canceled, The bottom of the team is collapsed. How could you expect the company to hire 10 or more people in a team in a short time? How could the team work? How could the team submit the work to clients during the deadline!

SUPPORT 24 MONTHS OPT EXTENSION!
