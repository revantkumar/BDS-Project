Di Fang I strongly support the extension for the following reasons:

1. With longer time in the US, more F1 students can stay here in the US, which greatly increase the domestic consumption.

2. Statistics show that there are great needs in the employment market regarding to STEM degrees. More talented, well-trained and high-educated people are needed. 

3. The extension of OPT will certainly not increase the number of immigration, as long as the total amount of working visa remains. 

Based on the reasons above, I believe that the extension of OPT is a good case!
