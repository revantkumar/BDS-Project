Karen Lee International students are making great contributions to our country. According to the Partnership For a New American Economy, immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million owrkers around the world in 2011. It would be unjust and shortsighted to deprived international student's of their legal right to work simply because they are not citizens.

STEM are fields critical to the US leadership in the world and many international students are among the best of these fields. H1B visa holders also pay often more than 30% of their salary to the federal and the state. The minimum hourly pay standard for H1B holders is $24.16 in Albany, NY, which is far beyond the region's minimum wage level.

In addition, international students are not an obstacle to raising the currently salary level in many industries, such as the computer science industry. Instead, outsourcing is a much bigger contributing factor.

The loss of international students in the job market would only create a short term relief of job competition. It is the same population who would vitalize the job market in the long term.
