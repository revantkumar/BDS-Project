Xiangxuan Gao I have to say, the cancellation would have huge impact on American employment market and cause a large brain strain out of USA. Not to mention the effect on all those international students. The extension can be shortened to like 12 months instead of being completely canceled. Even if the cancellation is necessary, it should not be carried out in this way. The process should be gradual. Above is my opinions. To sum up, I claim that I do not support the cancellation of STEM opt extension.
