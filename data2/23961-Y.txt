I have to say that it is strongly necessary to extend the OPT to keep the benefits of US.

Currently, I'm a Phd student on Computer Science, and I have worked on multiple NSF research projects. My general sense is that most projects lasts at least2-3 years, which is clearly beyond the period of 12-month OPT. Without extension, it is very likely that many post-graduation researchers have to stop the on-going project because of the expired status. Is this situation good for US?

Further, higher education highly competitive, and US's nowadays leading status benefit a lot from gathering talented international students. No one can doubt the fact that many of them are attracted by the good training opportunities, and thus the result can be expected if the opportunities disappears. Thus, in the long-term view, international students helps to keep US universities's global leading status.

Further, someone only complain the possible threat from those international students, they fail to see the great benefits to the community. For public universities, international students pay much higher tuition, which services as a great financial income for the universities. In addition, the community, restaurants, car dealers and homeowners, as a whole can benefit a lot from the large population of international students.
