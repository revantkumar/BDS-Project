I stand by this proposal.

If we cancel training opportunities, the economy of US will immediately collapse.

We cannot afford losing all these highly educated people, who are making essential contributions to the industry and science of our country.

If we cancel OPT STEM extension, international students will not stay, and even more, future international students may not consider coming to US, but go to Europe, UK, China, or India, where governments are spending huge amounts of money to attract scientists and engineers. We, the US, will be less competitive, compared to those countries. Thus would be a nightmare for the future of US, and finally affect all US people.

Thus, I absolutely support this proposal.
