I am here to support STEM OPT extension. First of all, the extension allows American companies have more chances to get qualified employees. Extending the OPT means allowing international students to stay for a longer time. In this case, American companies would have enough time to pick skilled employees before they are kicked out of America. Second, diversity is one of the most important characteristics of American society. From American history we can see: advocating diversity is one of the most effective ways to keep America making progresses. For example, if one American company wants to cooperate with Japanese companies, that will be really helpful if they have a Japanese employee. Third, for those people who think American citizens should have higher priority to be hired by American company, Charles Darwin would say you are wrong. Companies only hire people that are qualified. Even though you have American citizenship, if you can do nothing for the employer, why should they hire you? If you are thinking let those international graduates get out of America then you will be hired because they have no other choice but you, then i am wondering: do you really love America? International students work hard and they should have the chance to strive for their American dreams. Government extends the OPT and then let the company to decide whether F-1 STEMers should stay or leave (if they can't be hired, it is pointless for them to stay in America).
