As an international student majoring in electrical and computer engineering, I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. The reason I pursue my PhD degree in US is that US has the most well developed semiconductor industry. And since the electronics market is increasing rapidly all over the world. The requirement of the talented researchers in the semiconductor industry is more and more crucial to keep the US companies running with overwhelming competition over the other companies all over the world. Since there have been excellent semiconductor companies rising with excellent researchers contributing to them outside of the US, it will be definitely great to keep more talented researchers in the US so that they could work for the US companies. In this case, the new OPT extension rule will result in increased competition of the semiconductor industry in US. Without OPT extension, those talented people may just lose their chance to work for those companies. So I strongly agree with the new OPT extension rule.
