David Stone International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions. This suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
