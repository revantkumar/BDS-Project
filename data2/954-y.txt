Binyi Liu, Columbia University The reason why US still has such a great impact on the world is its policy of attracting thousands of elites from all over the world. The proposal which allow F-1 STEM students to extend the OPT period by 24 months (STEM OPT extension) will be a strong tool for maintaining these elites in US and make further contributions. The 12-month training for graduate student is only enough for them to equip themselves with skills, but then their skills and experience will be forced to be brought back to their original country. Longer time of STEM will help US gain sustainable work force and earn more benefits from these graduate student, and at the same time, the 24 months are not long enough for every student to settle down, which will not cause immigrant problems.
