Li Zhou I support the proposed OPT extension rule. STEM major graduates make huge contribution to US society in many domains. The OPT extension could further encourage the contribution and presumably reducing the numbers of immigration applications. 

In addition, I think there should be a differentiator placed to sepearate PhD level and master level graduates. The PhDs are generally leading cut edge technology in US. They should be served and make more contribution here.

If this country encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, there should be a visa catalog to address this need. There are tons of examples of international talents whose businesses make huge impact and creating jobs and profit in US.
