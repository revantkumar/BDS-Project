Abandoning STEM extension will prevent many highly educated and qualified people froming obtaining longer term working or immigration visas. This will force them to seek employeement in other countries. People who have STEM degrees are highly capable individuals who can help U.S. in economic growth, innovation and creating jobs. The STEM extension is a bridge that gives time for these individuals to apply more permanent visas. It would be a shame to force intelligent individuals who are willing to work for America leave. Abolishing STEM extension will create a huge brain drain of U.S. and exodus of highly educated individuals which is not the best interest for anyone living in America. 

In addition, most PhD (doctoral degrees) tuitions are paid with American tax dollars. A typical PhD costs around $350k in five years. Is it smart to let these PhD leave after graduation or let them work and pay taxes so that others can have the same education opportunities? I think the answer is oblivious.
