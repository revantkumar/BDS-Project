Anonymous The OPT, especially STEM OPT is good for America! Non-citizens are definitely NOT treated better. They pay much higher tuitions, which can be used to fund American students' financial aid. Their employment is also highly restricted. In fact, the average international student cannot get a job here at all. The ones who can get OPT extension are way above average, even outstanding. They significantly contribute to the technological development and advancement of the USA. On the surface it may appear that they take some jobs, but in the long run, they help keep this country strong and wealthy, as a result, we can live in nice houses, and drive cars, and have a safe country to live in. So the stem opt is good for America!
