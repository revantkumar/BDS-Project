The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers. Additionally, my nephew is a STEM worker. He has already lost one job to an H1B visa holder and was required to train his lower paid replacement. My nephew is an outstanding STEM employee and is being forced out of his field because the government wants to replace him with foreign workers. This is un-American and is complete insanity.
