I strongly support this extension rule. This helps US attract better talents in all industries. All the tax for revenues and tuition fees are pretty helpful to US economy. 
Honestly I do not understand the comments "we should give US citizens to have the STEM jobs". This is a fair market, everyone are at the same stage to find a job. US citizens has already owned some advantage to get a local job because they are residence and do not need sponsors. Each position should be given to a better fit and much hardworking person.
