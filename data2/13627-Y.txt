I fully support HSD to have 24 months extension for F-1 student. 
I am working for Fuyao Glass America for 8 months now. The company need me because I am good at Chinese and English for speaking, writing, listening, and reading. This Chinese glass company is the World's second largest automative glass maker. For the past 2 years, this company starts business in America, bringing more than 10,000 job opportunities into America. Fuyao has three manufacturing plants in America so far, and providing about 300 million top-ranking car glass to all OEM brands, Chevy, GMC, Buick, Cadillac, Ford, Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep, Ram, VW, BMW, Honda, Toyota... Bring more job opportunities to all American workers and good value glass to all OEM. Fuyao introduces the most advanced manufacturing technology into America. This company is expanding fast now and it needs a lot of STEM workers who know Chinese and English and technology at the same time. As STEM student, we know engineering, we know technology, we are the conduits between Chinese experienced workers and American native new workers. International students play important roles in the establishing and starting of the company's business in America.
If STEM students cannot have the extension, they cannot work for this company anymore. And without bilingual workers' support, this company will encounter difficulties and may close the business in America. If the company ends the business in America, 10,000 of American workers will lose their jobs.
