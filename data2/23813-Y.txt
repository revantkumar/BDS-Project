Some native American workers think that the international students and their OPT (extension) will have a negative influence on their working opportunities or their life. In fact,this is not the truth. According to research of NAFSA (Association of International Educators, a non-profit professional organization for professionals in all areas of international education), "in 2013-2014 academic year, 886,052 international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy". 123,465 direct jobs and 216,543 indirect jobs were created or supported thanks to the economic benefit of international students in US. So some of native American workers may actually benefit from this but do no know it.

On the other hand, as DHS stated, US academic sector would like to remain competitive globally and a STEM OPT extension is an action to better ensure this goal. Countries such as Canada, UK and Australia are actively attracting international students right now. One of the nice things about studying in US, compared to studying in other countries, is that OPT and the extension can help students to learn real industry/academic experience. In STEM area, due to the complexity of research or development, it often takes more than 1 year to finish a project and obtain relatively complete knowledge about the specific research topic.
