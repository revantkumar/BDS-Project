This OPT extension rule is definitely a support for USA economy. It's a fact that not so many Americans are learning these technology areas, and the marketplace has a high request for people possessing such knowledges. If the extension was cancelled, companies cannot afford employing and training foreign students for 1 year and then looking for new employers. It will be a great loss for these industries.
