I spent six years in the USA, I got good knowledge and I just want to serve people of such a great country. Having extended OPT helps me to get a practical knowledge and when I back home I can improve lives of several people. Also, if I work here in a company, when I get back home I can extend business of that company to my home country so I will work as an agent of that company in my country which helps your country get more income.
