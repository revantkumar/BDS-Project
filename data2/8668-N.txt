You have got to be kidding me! With as much unemployment that there is for US citizens in the high tech fields, you would think you would be pushing for our citizens instead of foreign workers. What is wrong with you? I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. In addition, this lowers the standard of living of people in this country. We all know, foreign workers will work for less money since most of the money goes back home to their countries. We need higher paying jobs in this country, not lower paying. Makes you wonder who's side are you on anyway?
