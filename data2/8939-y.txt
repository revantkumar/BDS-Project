Yanxing Wang To support this rule, I'd like to give some comments from universities' point of view.

As an international student, why do I choose US to study instead of UK, Australia or Canada? 

Everybody knows that applying US universities are hard and the tuition is relatively expensive. At least for me, one of the most important reasons is studying at US will give me 12+17 months OPT. With this 29 months OPT, I can get lots of industry experience and when I return my country I will be very competitive.

If the rule was removed, thousands of STEM students will feel CHEATED. In the future, I can say US universities will no longer be attractive for STEP students. In 2013/14, international students contributed more than $27 billion to the U.S. economy, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Most of this $27B was from STEMs. 

Guys, do you really want to lose that?
