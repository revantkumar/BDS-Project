I strongly support the proposed rule for improving and extending training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students. This will help the students to gather valuable practical work experience, and provide a clearer perspective about their career opportunities. I also think this will also help the US to attract talented international students from all around the world. Therefore, I strongly support this proposed rule.
