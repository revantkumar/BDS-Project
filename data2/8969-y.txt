Michael Brandon Please pass the rule. F-1 students are not illegal immigrants but a fortune for our country. I work in university and I can see how international student body can bring good diversity to the campus. I am sure these good international students will also help the country grow when they graduate and start working on our soil. I feel lucky that the most talented ones still consider our education the best and are willing to come for study and work.
