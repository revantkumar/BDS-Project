Shuo Li I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I was an international computer system engineering master student. Right now a software engineer intern.

I had multiple options to purse my master degree in different countries before I came to US. Without this OPT extension rule, I don't think US could attract foreign STEM students every year to contribute their knowledge. I probably would choose to study in other countries.
