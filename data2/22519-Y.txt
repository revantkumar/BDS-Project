From my point of view, this new rule can ensure U.S. a leading role in science and engineering and enhance American economy in the long run.

Longer OPT extension attracts intelligent international students to pursue a degree here in U.S. and make a contribution to science and engineering. Those young, smart an creative minds will make sure U.S. is still leading the world in the cutting edge of new technology.

More international students can bring more economic incentive to U.S.. Those international immigrants will study, live and travel in the U.S., which is a big incentive to travel industry, sales industry. More importantly, because they are creating more and more startups in U.S., they can create more and more job opportunities.
