I am a graduate Student with F-1 visa majored in Computer Engineering. I think this rule will benefit both the industry and STEM F-1 students, because as far as I know, there is not enough software engineer! 

According to the US Bureau of Labor, by 2020, there will be 1.4 million new developer job opening and only 400,000 computer science graduates to fill them. Although there are lots of schools like "General Assembly" and "Holberton School" trying to fill that gap, the market still needs more Engineering students. I think the new rule proposed by ICEB meet that need.
