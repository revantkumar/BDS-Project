I am very happy with the fact that DHS came up with better rules this time in order to benefit OPT STEM students. However, I feel that the mandatory rule that requires employers to provide training and mentorship to STEM student might backfire for firms that have very little resources. I honestly feel that in a real world environment there are cases when students should be able to learn on the job by themselves. I believe that DHS should not include this rule because it might prevent employers to hire OPT STEM students because of this. On the bright side, DHS proposal to increase the STEM opt to 24 months is a welcome change. It will enable the students have better chance to qualify for h1b lottery as they will have more chances.
