Please Extend the STEM OPT !!!

International students can make huge contributions to United States by working as hard as Americans. It is well know that international students from China, India and other countries are pretty good at subjects related to engineering and science not only because they are smart but also they study really hard. They wish to work in United States so they choose to spend four years or even longer time to study in universities in America. Most of the international students have great GPAs and proved their strong abilities to work well in technical fields. Thus, they get opportunities of internships in some famous companies in United States. 

However, the short OPT time recently becomes an obstacle to international students. If the OPT will not be extended, their will be a sudden short supply of technical people to the companies and the development of those companies depend greatly on the work of international students. Also international students who are preparing to apply American universities will be discouraged by the short OPT so that they would not spend the expensive tuitions to study in America. 

It is pretty obvious that a large portion of students in STEM majors are international students, so if the OPT is extended, they will make huge contributions to the technical development of America. If the OPT is not extended, the companies will definitely be influenced negatively and the development of technology in US will be impeded.
