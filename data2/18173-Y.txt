I strongly support this new proposed rule for STEM opt extension.

Firstly, this rule helps USA keep talented international students. Since most of the students who are going to need this extension already got full time job offers from US companies, which means they are needed because of their skills. We need to keep them in this country to help us build a stronger nation.

Secondly, this rule will definitely help the US education industry. We need fund to help our citizens to go to college and the international students are contributing a large amount for our universities. This is a win-win situation for both the international students and citizens.

Lastly, this wouldn't have too much impact on the US job market since this will only affect around tens of thousands of students. And I believe they are filling in a gap where some specific skills are needed that can not be fulfilled by our own people.

Besides, I hope the DHS should build better ways to avoid people abuse this new rule.

Thank you.
