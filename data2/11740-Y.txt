I strongly support this proposed rule for the following reasons:

1. Equality is the essential American spirit that makes US the most influential and most developed country in the world. Everyone should have the equal opportunity to get a job, work and live here. Approval of this proposed rule will show the world the central value of the American society, that is, everyone is equal here.

2. Talented foreign students have been bring their talents and gifts to serve US and have made significant contributions to all areas including but not limited to the STEM fields. Approval of this proposed rule will encourage more talented foreign students to come to US and contribute to the development of US. Otherwise, disapproval of this proposed rule will force a significant amount of foreign students to leave US soon after their graduation, which will only slow down the development of US.
