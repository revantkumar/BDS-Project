Even in STEM fields, it's extremely harder for international students to land a job. 

Many technology/financial companies refuse to accept international candidates' applications, not to mention the national companies/labs. 

It's unfair for those stellar international candidates who land a job and are kicked out of the country after a year. 

I support this new proposal.
