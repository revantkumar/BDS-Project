I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Intelligence is one of the most important contribution to the fast growth of the U.S.. It is the open-minded and welcoming attitude to the elites from other countries that makes United States the most powerful country in the world.

2. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

3. Competition does exist, but it may be a good thing to this country. 

4. Most of the international students are the elites in their own countries. Receiving better educations in the States would make them even more compitant in becoming the leaders/experts in their fields. They could be a great resource for the U.S., and so for their own countries if they are force to leave. As a result, the U.S. are training and helping its competitors in a great hand.
