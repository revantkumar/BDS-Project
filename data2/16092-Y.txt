America is a country of immigrants. I could imagine how bad the economy would be if the immigration is blocked. For those who defer this proposal, I highly doubt that you guys are just afraid to lose jobs because the markets are more competitive. 
And this extension just provides one more chance for those abled foreigners to get a H1B visa. The chance of getting the visa each year is only 25-30%. Immigrants are the inner productivity to drive us economy. If you want to drag the economy down, ban it!
