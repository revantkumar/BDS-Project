It is a crime that the elected representatives we trust to do what is best for America and American citizens have stooped to creating an immigration system which is destroying America and American jobs. It is also a crime that our education system has created millions of voters who lack the ability to discern how uncontrolled immigration is destroying their ability to earn a living wage in America. Our politicians have already spent our grand children's future and now they are giving away our children's present. It is sad and will get sadder.
