yida yang The program will not take jobs away from American workers for the following reasons:
1. This program is aimed at extending the eligible working time of advanced degree holders in STEM. A lot of positions out there, mainly in corporate R&D and scientific research, requires advance degree holders. As far as I am seeing, there are only limited number of Americans who truly wants to spend years of their time earning advanced degrees. It is fair to say the demand is over supply in these positions.
2. From my own experience, employers favor US citizen employees MUCH more over foreign employees. For any position, the privilege always goes to US candidates, as there are much more time and money to spend on hiring a foreign employee than a US citizen (all sorts of fees and processes). I cannot emphasis this any more, as I faced these situations numerous times when i was looking for a job.
3. Two years of OPT extension is not a permanent work visa. There are only limited spots for work visa every year. Employers would not want to hire a person who can only work for 2 years and has unknown future afterwards, unless they cannot find any suitable US candidates.

In conclusion, American workers have much more advantage over foreign workers if they are competing for the same position. This program is aimed at filling in the gap of supply for advanced degree positions. The conflict of interest here between American workers and foreign workers are small.

An addition comment to some people who are saying foreign workers are bringing down salary rates: Foreign workers cannot bring salary rates down. Instead, I know a lot of foreign workers, who work in corporate R&D positions, are earning high salaries. They get what they deserve and it is now way past the era where foreign employees would sacrifice their earnings just to stay in the states.
