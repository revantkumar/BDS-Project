There is no evidence showing STEM international student labors are cheap.

I was a student majored in Information Technology and Management in the University of Texas at Dallas. During past 3 years, there were more than 80% student in our program are international students. (Attached picture - STEM Student Profile - ITM) 

During academic years of 2012-2015, the average hourly salary of our internships are $20.36. Is this rate cheap in Texas? (Attached official statistical data - "ms_itm_internship_2012_13", "ms_itm_internship_2013_14" and "ms_itm_internship_2013_14")

Above data also list the employers of our students. Most of them are well-known companies, such as AT&T, Ericsson, UPS, IBM, Dell, etc. All information can be find on the Link. http://jindal.utdallas.edu/isom/information-systems-programs/ms-information-technology/#05-student-profiles-amp-statistics

There might be some STEM students hired by low rate, but when discussing about a new immigration rule, it's make more sense to consider the average rate in the big picture.
