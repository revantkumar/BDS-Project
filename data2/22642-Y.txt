Strongly Support New Rule. Tuition from foreign students is one of the important source for US educational funds, and at least half of the foreign students majored in STEM professions. If the new rule couldn't be proposed successfully, the ethusiasm of foreign students who plan to study in US will de depressed, and it will cause financial loss directly. New rule of OPT extension is not only necessary for foreign students, but also benefit for government.
