Edward Smith As an analyst I would like to point out that allowing more international students work in the US as hi-tech roles will actually CREATE more job opportunities for Americans. Because within a business the proportion of different roles have to be balanced. A business cannot just recruit more and more hi-tech employees without getting much more people for other roles. According to the study here:
http://www.bayareacouncil.org/community_engagement/new-study-for-every-new-high-tech-job-four-more-created/
"For each job created in the high-tech sector, approximately 4.3 jobs are created (multiplier effect) in other local goods and services sectors across all income groups, including lawyers, dentists, schoolteachers, cooks and retail clerks, among many others."
And also:
"The jobs multiplier effect in the high-tech sector is significantly higher than for almost any other sector. By comparison, traditional manufacturing has a multiplier effect of 1.4 jobs.
Demand for high tech occupations will be considerably stronger than demand for other workers at least through 2020."
Hence this greatly benefits all Americans. I strongly support this proposed rule. And I insist that not improving opportunities for international students is short-sighted and not wise at all.
