I strongly support the STEM extension new policy. The reason why I support will be listed as the following: First, no country in this world could develop its society without having talents in math, science, engineering and technology. International students in STEM majors are the smartest and most talented students in their home country. They work so hard and put the skills that they have learned from university into practice. It definitely will benefit development of US economy. Extending OPT will help US attract more talents in area of high technology. Please pay attention: it is not for all the internationals, just for STEM majors. Second, OPT extension will not fight against American U.S. born citizens. Only when a society is well competitive and strong, it will create more job opportunities. Only when a country welcome and cherish these STEM talented students, it can be more competitive and strong enough. The relationship of STEM internationals and U.S. born citizens is not to fight against in chaos, but to work together to make American a better and strong country. Not only our generation, but also our next generations will be proud of what we do today. It should not limit to race, color, and where you come from. To fulfill American dream, we should open our door and respect all the people who make contribution to US. OPT extension is not a green card, not a citizenship for STEM students. It is only an opportunity for these smart student in high-tech to use what they have learned to contribute US economy. Third, this OPT extension is very important for students, employees and employers. Today, there are many international students in STEM in high-tech companies. And they get trained and do a great job in company that can bring huge profit to their company. Canceling the OPT extension is great loss for these companies. OPT 24months extension will have a great effect on the development of USA. I strongly hope the rule can be approved.
