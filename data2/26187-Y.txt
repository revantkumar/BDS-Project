After reviewing so many negative comments who object the proposed rule. They all come to one point that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries.

I don't think they have to worry about this at all. 

First, OPT extension only allows international students to work in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if they get caught. 
Second, it was because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that international student can come in. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. 

And those tech companies is risking potential loss of those international employees because of the H1B lottery system.

Anyway, blaming foreign students for not able to find a job is absurd. If one is good enough, he/she will get hired.
