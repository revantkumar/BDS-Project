Most foreign students are perusing or have earned higher degree in the US (Master or PhD). They are very important for many industries. For example, the R&D department in my company hired three PhDs in last year. Their creative idea, solid background and knowledge are very important for my company. Most of the foreign employees are driving innovations. Some people may ask me why we don't hire citizen to do this work. The answer is we couldn't find high degree US citizen can to do this work. If we revoke the OPT rule, are the citizens ready? No! the US citizens are not ready to take over those jobs. 

Due to the H1B cap and large number of applicants, none of the new employees in my company obtained H1B visa. They have to use OPT extension to work for us. If the extension was revoked, it could be a disaster for my company and even for the whole industry, since we couldn't hire more young foreign scientists any more. They will go back to their countries and work for competitors. This could make our technologies far behind other countries. Many companies have to meet the same situation. The US will no longer be a strong and attractive country any more. Our economy will go down, no people want to buy our product. The companies will fire more people to reduce cost and survive. The unemployment rate will definitely rise.

If we want to reject this rule, we have to make sure the US is ready to do that, make sure the US have enough well educated higher degree citizens to fill those jobs. If not, the country is not ready, We should not do it now! We should have a long term plan before we make such disaster come true.
