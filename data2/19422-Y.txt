I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1: Those have advanced degree from US universities, they learn knowledge from US system. Those who want to stay in US, they need to stay away from their country and can't visit their family, which means they like America and they want to make a contribution to America.
2: Competition dose exist. But if American itself is not excellent enough, they can't blame international students. We work hard to make a living instead of playing all day or doing nothing all day. Those excellent white people, like Mark Zackerburg, he always support immigration action.
3: Diversity is an important factor which makes American a great country. A lot fancy company like Apple, Yahoo, Tesla, their co founders are from other countries.
4: We are different from terrorist. If we stay in America, we will contribute the best time in our life, 20s-30s in America. If your government fail this action, it's ok. We will go back to China or India.
5: If you fail this action, those software company will face serious shortcoming of technical staff. It will affect the whole industry and bad for country.
