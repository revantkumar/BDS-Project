I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The US government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country so that they can make contributions to the States and give back to the society. 

2. Diversity is very important for the US, the biggest immigration country of the world Many famous scientists or great politicians were once foreign students who came to the US studying and working for the States.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Foreign students are not taking jobs from US citizens, because most positions that prefer international students (like high-tech companies and research institutes) as they cannot find ideal local candidates. Instead, competitions can help the US to select out greater talents, to motivate every young student to improve themselves, no matter international students or US local students, and eventually to increase the competitiveness of US as a country in the world.
