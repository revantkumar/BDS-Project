Ren Lu I strongly support the new proposal for OPT STEM extension. I am a student from University of Michigan, majoring Computer Science. One reason make me decide to go to United States for college education is the Optional Practical Training, compared with going to other countries like UK and Canada for study. I feel better to study in the institutes here because I will have better chance to learn in the industry.

In addition, I was an intern and now an incoming software engineer for a famous tech company in United States. Under the current extension situation, many very talented engineers have to leave the company because the OPT extension is short and they fail to get the H1B Visa. One of teammate in that company is from New Zealand, he is now under the 17-month OPT STEM extension. If the government extend the extension to 24 months, he will have a better chance to stay here to contribute more his talents to the company.

Therefore, I hope the new proposal for OPT STEM extension could pass!
