I strongly support the notion to extend the training opportunity for foreign students. There is no doubt that the highly qualified foreign students have already made their contribution in their field of study in the past decades, extending the training period will make them even more prepared for the competition in today's market. For a STEM graduate, the project the will undertake is usually complicated and will take years to implement and therefore a longer training time will definitely guarantee a better result for the project. Some people pointed out that the government are providing more opportunities for foreign students than U.S citizen. In my point of view, a healthy competition will not only increase the overall intellectual level of graduates in America but also push the education system into a better place. There is no bias but fair. After all it is the actual work that determines the importance of a student.
