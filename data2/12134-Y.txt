While it has been the practice to overlook and even invite foreign workers to come and take the jobs that Americans supposedly won't take, I believe that this does take some jobs away from American workers. The proposal to let students stay and work here, after graduating college, even giving them preference to American workers is something that we do not need to put up with. I have seen many students who come to study, stay here to work as they know that they can make a much better wage here than they can in there own country where they are sorely needed. This does not do their people any favors.
