This new policy totally make sense. Why should the US spend resources educating foreign students and refuse them from working for this country, especially considering they are already hired by US companies who are in need of technical employees? In the past centuries, immigrants with skills have come to this great country, worked very hard, and found their places here. There is no reason we should stop that trend, especially when it is totally a win-win for both US and the students.
