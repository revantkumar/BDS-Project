I am a PhD graduate students studying robotics. The reason I chose to pursue my degree in US is because it was able to provide F1 students up to 29 months OPT training in major-related industries of STEM.
Now i am in initial 12 month opt. I am working in Ford as a research engineer to develop autonoumous vehicles. This project cannot be finished in just one year. One fourth of the group are international students in OPT. They are an important part of the group. 

As a China citizen, I will eventually return to China. Three years experience in US industry will make me much more competitive in China's job market then. This will be also true to other students from China as well as other countries. If opt was reduced to one year only, universities in US will become much less attractive. This is a definite lose to US universities. For example, my previous university, Arizona State University gain a lot of financial income from international student. International student usually pay high tuition. Such income is vital to the University under State budge cut. International student not only contribute tuition but also spend significantly in other parts in US society, for example, touring and housing. 3 year opt will surely attract more international students to US. This will benefit US in both high tech industries, education industries, and other aspects of the society.
