I STRONGLY SUPPORT the rule that expands the training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees, for the following reasons.

(1.) Make US an attractive country (international students contribute to United State- they bring money from their country, increase the economy, they work hard, they are talented (don't forget that US schools are highly selective))

reasonably longer OPT time will attract more and more talented international students to study at United States. It is beneficial to both the students and the states, provided that (a.) most students pay the out-of-state tuition/living cost by themselves which can create job opportunities in relevant field (b.) many students apply jobs in some top US companies such as google, Facebook and etc. These companies have business all over the world therefore it is beneficial to hire talented international students as well as top level domestic students. One may argue that the international students may occupy too many openings that are supposed to be fitted by domestic students. Please note that, many people share a huge cake is much better than few people share a tiny cake, because if the company is no longer on the top in the field, other companies (for example Baidu, Huawei) will take most of the cake!

(2.) Keep US on top of technology field (diversity is IMPORTANT!)
united states is a country that unions people from various area, original countries, races, etc. this is what makes us unique and on the top in many technology filed. however, recent years, technologies in countries other than united states, for example in india, germany, japan, china, many emerging companies /technologies are catching up. it is beneficial for the states to have more talented students to work on those technologies so that to keep US on the top. The argument that this will let domestic employees to loose their jobs is short-sighted.
