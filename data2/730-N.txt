Legal and illegal immigration legislation boils down to one thing. These are American Jobs, and who will get these jobs? This is a fact, illegal immigrants steal jobs from American workers. I have personally witnessed this at least three times in Franklin County, Florida. American workers are the backbone of our nation, and their future must be protected. Big business would send the American worker down the river in the blink of an eye. The American Middle Class must be preserved. The American voter must punish any candidate, or political party that promotes illegal immigration and amnesty. American Workers are fighting for their lives and futures. Through the internet and mass information we will prevail.
