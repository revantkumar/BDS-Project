This is a significant rule change that will indeed Hell top keep our universities relevant on a global scale. Allowing these students the extra time to remain on positions of higher math and science aptitude will encourage then to seek citizenship and stay, with their advanced knowledge base, in the United States which will bolster our white collar workforce. I fully support the rule change.
