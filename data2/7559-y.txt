Anonymous I graduated in Dec 2014 from a STEM field. All my American classmates have got tons of interview opportunities within a couple months after the graduation. However, when they forwarded those opportunities for me, I got 'Sorry, we don't have quota for sponsorship' from a lot of companies. 

It took me almost 6 months to finally get a job from a company, which is e-verified and willing to sponsor. 

Now, I have missed the first chance to apply for H1-B visa. 

The OPT extension is my only chance to try to get H1-B visa. Sponsoring a foreign student takes resources that many companies won't be willing to do it. That is not fair for us when we try to get a job. It will be worse, if we are not even have enough time to apply for a H1-B visa, at least for once. 

We work triple hard to fight for our dreams. All we're asking is for a little bit more time.
