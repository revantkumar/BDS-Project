I would vote affirmatively for the proposal because of the following reasons:

1. The knowledge and expertise of STEM students have be a crucial impetus of technological advance of America, which guarantee the leading role of U.S. government in the world's economy and multiple political stages. 

2. The policy would influence the prospect of graduate education in U.S.. With sufficient OPT extension, the international student could get more training and opportunities for their career, which fulfill the purpose of higher education. Without OPT extension, application of graduate program will be less attractive for the international students and slash the number of potential students who prove to be excellent.

3. The OPT extension does not jeopardize the employment conditions of U.S. citizens. The job market section for STEM major has been quite selective. Instead, with the workforce provided by STEM students, the economy is less likely to be in bad shape and contributes the well-being the the whole country.
