akshay paul As a student who has come all the way from the other part of the globe, leaving behind friends, family to foreign land in the hopes of learning new things ,gain bigger perspectives, improving one's self and Contributing to technology with lots of handwork , toil and sleepless nights makes it imperative the we reap the benefits of out fruits.

In my personal experience, Studying at an american university has definitely sharpened my research skills, Made me think about more innovative ideas, broadened my mind by allowed me to interact with people who are professionals in their field. I truly am grateful for this opportunity of learning more by coming over to this Land. And a big part of this learning process comes not just from College Related work, but by knowing what happens in an industry. Working in an industry complements working in a research project at a University. What ever we learn in college complements what is done in the industry and this helps in bringing up new ideas and starting new Innovation. 

Hence, I believe all the handwork and effort that we put into college should not go in vain after graduating. The knowlegde gained by research can make significant contributing to the industry. Thus I am strongly in favor of 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.
