I'm an international student graduated from a top tier state university. There're thousands of international students studying in my university and over 50% of them major in STEM fields. I had the opportunity to talk to them on many occasions and found these international students are very talented people who received offers from universities around the world. A crucial factor impacting their decision to come to the States is the fact that US has OPT STEM program that no other countries possess. International STEM students add to the diversity of my university and compose talent pool for domestic companies.

Besides, as international students, we pay exorbitant education fee to receive the same education as other American students. In my major, foreign students are not even eligible to apply for scholarship though top 10 of my major are usually are foreigners. With such high expense, let alone other phisical and mental obstacles, we still choose to come to US, because we believe US policies can provide legal assistance for us to practice what we learned before we go back and continue our career. Not passing this proposal will greatly jeoperdize US educational insititutions no matter from economic or reputational perspective.
