I support the new OPT rule. I am a international student from China and pursuing an MS degree in New York University.

These years, more and more students in China like me choose a university out of China for higher education. The US is the first of our choice, because CPT and OPT give us more opportunities to practice our study. Especially in STEM, a research or project is usually in a long term. The 24-month extension is reasonable for that. Without the extension, STEM students will have less time to practice in the US, and they may go to another country like UK, Canada, Australia, rather than the US for better practice. If it happens, there will be a big loss for the universities in US. 
Only in China,2014 one year, there are 460 thousand students study abroad, 60% of them are in the US and a big part of them are in STEM area. Even if only half of them change their target country, the effect to education of US is really huge and the effect to economy is even inestimable. So the new OPT rule is beneficial to both the US and international students.
