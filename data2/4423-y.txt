Jeanne Burns This is an outrage. In addition to allowing foreign STEM workers to work in the US employers can hire them without paying payroll tax. This means the US Engineer costs $12,000 more per year than his Indian counterpart. Additionally these jobs go thru contractors and are never offered to US students.

Fully 2/3s of US STEM grad cannot find work largely due to this. This is all about cheap labor. How do I know? I call on colleges and universities selling software. Because the foreign students pay full sticker price upfront they are accepted at top Universities. Most of these students cannot communicate in English never mind College Level. They usually cheat on their transcripts and have soneone else take their TOFL and write their essays. I know this first hand and from school administrators because I sell the software that helps them with this,

There is no shortage. These are not best and brightest.The schools want them because they pay full sticker, The employers want them because they cost 25- 30%less than their US counterpart. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE, THEY ARE NOT BEST AND BRIGHTEST.This is about cheap labor while 2/3rd of the STEM US Grad cannot find work. This is treasonous for US students to be so ill served.
