STEM students are the treasure of the global human beings. As the greatest country in the world, the United States should create every possible convenience for these students to stay and contribute to the country's development.They do take jobs, but they also create the market, create jobs and spend money in the USA as consumers. They are a strong power in the job market which can not be replaced by anyone else. They will make the whole country more competitive!
