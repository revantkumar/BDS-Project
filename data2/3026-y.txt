Sophie Gao From my perspective, I strongly support the proposal. There're many reasons in my mind, here just list a few of them mainly here:

First of all, Frankly speaking, few American local students learn STEM majors in USA. So, to further develop USA in STEM fields, the government should allow the students who study knowledge in American universities stay in this country for a while so that the STEM students could keep making contributions to USA.

Secondly, we all know that the USA is a country who was established by all kinds of peoples from all over the world so that it's so far the most developed country in the world, which means that diversity is very important for USA. Why not make OPT extension valid then?

Last but not the least, competitions are everywhere in current society. Even though there're no foreign students for employment competing with local Americans, competitions do exist all the time. Then why do we accept more competitors to make the performance more excellent? It is indeed not a bad thing for both sides.

Thanks! Please approve the OPT expanding for F1 students of STEM!!!
