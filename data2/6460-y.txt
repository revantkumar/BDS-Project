Pheobe Jiang I'm a computer science student who already worked for 5 years before I went back to school. I choose U.S. to finish my graduate program because I believe the system here can train me into a master in my field.
There is a theory,"If you want to become a master in any thing, it takes you at least 10,000 effective hours to reach your goal". I choose to spend my 10,000 hours here because I trust the America education system and I know there is a good environment here to help me become who I want to be. The school only can offer me the first part- abstract theory and knowledge. I still need the second part- practice and gain experience in workplace. Because the whole technical level here is definitely higher here than my home country- although the internet growing fast these years, the technic part still need to improve- I can become a master faster here. 

The 24 extension of OPT offer us more time to train ourselves. Also, we don't mean that we compete with you- all we want, is an opportunity to be prepared. I have a very good feel about the internet industry in China, I wish I can be an important part of it with my technic I learned here and experience I gained here. It is a win-win, right?

There is another reason why I choose U.S. to spend the most important 3 or 4 years. I admire the "America dream", which means anyone can finally reach his/her dream by working hard. I worked very hard to be here, to try to be a better person and a better programmer. I believe that you all understand, after all, we share a same "America dream".
