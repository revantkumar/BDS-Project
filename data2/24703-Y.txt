I would support the new rules of OPT STEM regulation. 
First, the high-level degree education is a key element for the development in the modern society, especially in the STEM fields. However more and more students in these fields are international students. For example, in MIS master program in University of Arizona, 95% students are international students. In order to maximize their contribution for the United States, I would give them more time to serve the U.S. rather than let them come back to their country and compete with U.S.
Second, the new OPT rule won't compromise the working opportunity for U.S. citizen. The key to measure it could be the number of H1B issued every year. In current years, this number hasn't changed. Supposing students having more time, most of them still have to go back to their own country after OPT.
Third, in response to some comments said the OPT is the reason of citizen losing jobs, it's not. Not all companies are qualified as an E-verify company to hire an international students. And even for an E-verify company, OPT actually is not a good advantage for hiring them because company tends to hire a more stable employee. Considering the disadvantages, whoever hired, including the international students, are really the ones who can meet the job's requirement.
