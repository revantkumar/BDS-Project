Aditya Anil Alwe I fully support the new change of increasing the current F1 OPT STEM extension of 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received.I believe the extension should be made 36 months given the cap on H1-B visas and increasing applicants every year. 

This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness so that talented graduates from top US schools can stay back and contribute to the nation's progress.
