Maria Wang I strongly support this proposal!
Because,
1. Everyone has the equal rights to get education and get a job.
2. F-1 students accept the education in the United State does not mean they will immigrant.
3. Actually, the United State should be proud of these International students. When they study sth in order to apply it in their works, this means they show how advanced the education is in the United State to the world.
