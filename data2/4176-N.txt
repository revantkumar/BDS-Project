please note the attached comments that concern the expansion of the OPT program----the DHs is definitely out of bounds in a n attempt to allow foreign workers the opportunity to overstay their visa and in the end it hurts the american tech workers re: getting a job, since employers will be more apt to hire foreign workers for less pay and avoid income tax on earnings WRONG WRONG WRONG!!! THIS IS A VERY SNEAKY AND VERY UNSCRUPULOUS WAY AROUND THE SYSTEM WITH NO REAL GOOD OUTCOME,ONLY MORE DEMOCRATIC VOTERS!!
