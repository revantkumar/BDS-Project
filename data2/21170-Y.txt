I strongly support this rule. I have seen some comments saying that OPT has denied 4,30,000 jobs for citizens. But all this figures are false. In fact because of this rule american economy reached its peak. You can easily see in the field of research how many STEM graduates are there. None of the Americans have lost their jobs because of international graduates. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. I request everyone to support this rule and please issue this rule as soon as possible
