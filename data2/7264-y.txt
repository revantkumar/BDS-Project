John Erickson I strongly support the reinstituted rule. Im working in a high tech company and working with many international students. They are pretty smart and contributing a lot to the company. I believe international students especially those learning STEM in U.S. colleges create more job opportunities for our U.S. citizens. It is untenable saying these STEM students reduce job opportunities for U.S. citizens. Anyway, please help pass this proposed rule, which is not only good my company but also great for the whole country.
