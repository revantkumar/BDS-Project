I strongly support the proposal. The reasons are as follows.

First, take the PHD program as an example. In general, it will take at least five years to nurture a PHD student. Quite a little of research fund is used to fund these PHD students. If we do not let them work and just let them go back to their own countries, why to drain on manpower and material resources to nurture them. They have to work for the country to pay for the resources, and OPT extension is the precondition.

Second, the 24-month extension is a practical length for OPT program. Based on my research experiences, most large research or software development projects would take at lease 2 years or more. If the OPT extension is too short, foreign STEM workers would lose their VISA before the completion of projects. That will be an immeasurable loss for the research project and the companies.
