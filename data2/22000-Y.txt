Stop this insanity and stop making it difficult for American citizens to get good jobs by making them compete for those jobs against foreign students.
It's bad enough they are coming over and taking school positions away from our citizens, now they want to take jobs in this country too.
They should follow the spirit of the program that allows foreign students in this country and that is to get an education and then
take that skill back to their own country and lift them up out of the depths of poverty. We are NOT here to save the world!!!!
