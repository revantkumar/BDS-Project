Dear Sir or Madam,

I am a research scientist of Philips global research and advanced development, currently holding F1 visa with stem OPT extension. I am definitely supporting to the enhanced rule for stem OPT extension.

I got my PhD. degree in U.S. and fulfilled my postdoc research work in biomedical department at Johns Hopkins University. With recognized academic achievements and highly trained skills in Physics and engineering, I joined Philips research as an medical imaging expert working on excited and innovative techniques to keep improving healthcare of U.S citizen and translate cutting-edge technology to the society. 

If the stem OPT extension were stopped, there will be high probability for the people like me to terminate the employment due to the Cap-Gap of H1B visa. To myself, for sure, I will feel very sad because I have to stop my meaningful work here. To company, it is also an inevitable loss of excellent people who can bring great idea to the company and can break through the limitation of technology. 

In addition, I always believe that U.S. is a country standing for freedom and equality. A lot of aliens and immigrants together are creating the history of U.S.. I personally hope the U.S. government can give more opportunities to the foreigners who are laboring with their irreplaceable knowledge and skills and serving the country.

Thanks for your reading,
