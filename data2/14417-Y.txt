I strongly support this proposal because such rule will help America keeping its leading role in the high tech industry. Some people are concerning that this rule may put U.S. workers in a unfair situation which is absolutely not true. In my opinion, the equal work opportunity is regulated by others laws and this OPT extension has nothing to do with that. 

United States will benefit from this extension because this rule does not force anyone or any company to hire aliens, instead it extends the human resources market of US companies and those companies can have a better chance to get the people they want.
