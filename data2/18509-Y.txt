I'm shocked that so many negative comments on this law. Be wise, the STEM 1) Benefits the academic economic for huge tuition fees, the economic in a whole for more parents tours/ life spending, etc.; 2) Bringing more dynamic academic activities; 3) Keeping competitiveness of technical industries of U.S.
For a long term consideration, I highly support this act.
