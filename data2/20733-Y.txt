Expanding OPT STEM Extension is really appreciable and should be implemented before court's deadline. However, I would like to say DHS on this platform that few small private universities having one or two blocks with out basic infrastructure, potential Professors and School Campus welcome huge no.of International students( more than 2500 students per semester) not based on their previous academic achievements and offering no course work at all here are making fun of this program especially in California and some other parts. Unemployed youth abroad are choosing this path and creating a shortcut to enter USA, get OPT, get H1B with out having a real stuff and standing beside a student who really have outstanding talent. I request your agency to review those schools, take appropriate actions and make justice to the students who really participate in rigorous course work and research. I can say the name of the schools, but do not want to reveal in a public platform.
