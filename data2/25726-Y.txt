I think the extension of OPT program is great. 
My girlfriend is an international student. She studies Electrical and Computer Engineering here. 
She recently got a job in one of the biggest technology companies in Seattle, and I know how hard she has been working to achieve this. The rumor about international student taking lower payment is simply false, because her package is higher than my current salary as an embedded software engineer. 
At our school's career fair, most companies don't even give international students a chance to interview, and you truly have to be exceptional to get a good job here, as a foreigner. 
But our current immigration system creates yet another barrier for those talented students like my girlfriend. If she cannot get the work visa through the broken lottery system, she might be forced out of the country after living here legally for more than 5 years. 
This rule has a direct effect on my personal life. But I also strongly believe that America will also benefit from this kind of policy. In our college, a lot of PHD students, professors and researchers have foreign backgrounds, and their contribution to science and technology is extremely important to our society. Everyday, foreign researchers and students are involved in cutting edge research in the many labs across our campus, and many of those research projects will truly change our world in the future. 
My own grandparents were originally from Portugal. They came here for a better life. And my father was able to gain good education, and has been working as a software engineer for over 20 years. Citizens or not, those with talents and strive for the best should be respected and rewarded.
