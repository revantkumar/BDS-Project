The presiding government of the U.S. of America are systematically putting Teens and others that were not able to finish high 
school or attain a college education at risk. Millions of families and individuals are being forced into the welfare program because 
of the increasing foreign students and workers taking the lower paid jobs here in America, which systematically keeps the wages 
earned by Americans low. This does increase the earnings of large corporations that employ these workers. This also increases
the gap between the "haves and have not's". When will our representatives start looking out for the welfare of our own countrymen?
We must put all representatives on notice that we as Americans will not longer tolerate this abuse of their representation. 
Representatives of Congress are sent to be care takers of the people that elected them to their positions. They are not to be 
persuaded by lobbyist that represent large self interest groups. It is the job of a representative of Congress to think and act in the
best interest for this country. Not how they can line their pockets with lobbyist money, This atrocity must be stopped.
