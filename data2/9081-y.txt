John Cain I strongly agree with this regulation.

1. Fix the H1b and L1 program that are all but monopolized
by Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and HCL, Deloitte and Accenture.
Foreign students pay premium dollars to get an American education,
and deserve a little payoff, a little American dream. The American public
will also benefit from the best and brightest international talents.

2. Without Opt, and with H1b being unavailable to American educated 
international students,
American education industry will risk a death spiral because foreign
students and parents will wake up to the scam. 

3. Our town is an university town. Without the foreign students,
we will lose jobs and lose a big part of our local economy. 

4. Please stop the racist H1b and H4 contracting companies
like Infosys, Tata CS, Cognizant from overtaking over American
STEM, especially the sensitive IT industry.
