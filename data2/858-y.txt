Derek Yang I am currently working at a small start up at Culver City doing web development. The company currently has two programmers, me and another international student. We're responsible of everything related to the technique of the website and both of us are working under opt. It's obvious that it is because of the so many talented international students that makes the IT industry so robust and prosperous these years. And if we are not able to work any longer, the company will definitely stop everything it's doing now until it hires new programmers.
