I strongly support this. 
Some local people think foreigners grab their jobs. But actually, they got much more job opportunities than us foreigners. Because of our visa status, our language problem, we lost a lot of offers. I still remember that when I was job seeking, one of my american classmate got a really great offer with high salary, though his GPA was much lower than mine. I totally understand this because he can communicate with interviewer better than me. He can easily understand their jokes, their questions and answer cleverly, which is not easy for a foreigner. If I am an interviewer. I would love to offer a job to this guy instead of some "weird" foreigners. So they are accessible to many opportunities that foreign students are never able to reach. How can they say that we foreign students grab their opportunities. They are actually competing with other americans most of time.
And I also saw someone said that some employers prefer foreign employees because foreigners got lower salary than American employees. That's NOT TRUE. As far as I know, my salary is as much as my American colleagues'. And some of my friends' are even higher because they have more works. I know people feel bad when they were laid off. But it is really bad to blame these on us foreigners. An employer will never lay off an useful employee. They are laid off because they didn't work hard. They just used us foreigners as an excuse so that they don't need to face the reality that they were laid off because of theirselves. We foreigners always work hard because we are afraid of losing jobs and being deported. That's why there are less foreigners being laid off. It is definitely not because we got less money!!
So in conclusion, we foreigners are not grabing jobs from local americans. They got much more job opportunities than us. And even without us foreigners, those people who didn't work hard would still be laid off. And they would got no one to blame on.
