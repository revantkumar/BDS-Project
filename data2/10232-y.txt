Kavya Malla STEM extension plays a crucial role in foreign students career ,who want to apply their skills that they acquired by spending time,money and effort by being away from their home, so that they can contribute to the world and make a change. It is in no way, in my honest opinion, a threat to the citizens of this country as America has always been a land of opportunities. There are equal opportunities for every one of us and it is the very diversity of this country that has put in on top of the world. I have always believed that USA encourages talent irrespective of race,ethnicity,color and creed as it is obvious from its long and glorious history.

This is a ray of hope for all those legal immigrants who wish to contribute to US economy and also gain valuable experience by working here. I fully support the DHS rule of extending OPT for 24 months.
