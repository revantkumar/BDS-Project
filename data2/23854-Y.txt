I strongly support this proposal for the reasons as follows:

1. Many international students not only came to the United States to learn knowledge, but also made great contributions to their school, community and the whole country. Their contributions includes but are not limited to making ground-breaking discoveries in scientific research, increasing the cultural diversity in US and leading student organizations/campaigns for the benefits of student groups and the community. They should be given the opportunities to continue contributing to US after their graduation for a certain amount of time.

2. A large number of people who made or have been making contributions to US were international students. If people like Kai-Fu Lee (former Vice President of Apple & Google) and Satya Nadella (current CEO of Microsoft) weren't given a significant amount of time for OPT, they couldn't have stayed in US and have made a difference for this country. If the OPT extension is denied, we will send leaders like them who could have led US to its even greater prosperity back to their own country to lead the development of their father country against the United States.

3. Competition between US citizens and international students can stimulate both groups to do their best in their jobs. Honestly, there are many positions that don't fit American people. Overall, together talented international students and Americans can make this country become even greater.
