I strongly support this proposed rule.
First, OPT program is directly related to US educational institutions and is fundamentally a selling point of the US educational market. A lot of people come to the US rather than go to other countries because of this benefit. 
Second, US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here.
