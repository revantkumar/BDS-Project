While U.S. policy should be to facilitate the immigration of "the best and the brightest" from around the world, the vast majority of foreign students are ordinary people whom American employers hire to do ordinary work. This is disadvantaging U.S. citizens and permanent residents, and thus OPT should be curtailed, not expanded. The DHS proposal is shameful.
