I strongly agree with this policy to expand the OPT time for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees. The reason why the U.S has such rapid development speed is because it is quite open to all the outstanding people from over all the world. The development of a country is highly related to the contribution made by the people there, no matter he is a native or not. If the students could stay and work in the U.S for some time, after they get degrees in STEM, it could benefit both the students and U.S government. They come to the U.S to get educated. Then they could gain experience and make contribution to the U.S society when they work and apply their knowledge here. This is not a policy related to migration, but a policy to provide opportunities for both the students and the U.S government to gain benefits.
