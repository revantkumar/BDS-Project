I think this decision will definitely help me to get good knowledge. The things which I studied during my masters are mostly theoretical, if I am able to implement practically that will help me a lot. In order to do that 12 months will not be enough, by the time understand the work culture in USA almost 8 to 10 months will be gone. So definitely we need this extension badly which will help me. Not only me , like me lot of young graduates wanted this rule to pass
