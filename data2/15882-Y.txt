I highly agree to extend the allowed working time after graduation to 24 months for internationsl students:
1.It is part of American pursuit that opportunities should be equally offered to every people. Extention of time in OPT policy wil show that America's guarantee of social equality.
2.Extention of time means talent international students can work longer in the intellectual IT field and Mathmatica field, benefiting the future technology in USA.
3.More expenses will be needed for F1 students to live longer in America so that it will stimulate Amrrican economy hugely.
