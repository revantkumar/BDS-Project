This is taking jobs away from Americans, just to save the administration's cronies, like Facebook some money. Homeland Security can't even keep up with the students' whereabouts when their visas expire. This is not just a jobs/economy issue, it's the safety of American citizens at risk. You're destroying the country I love.
