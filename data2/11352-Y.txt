As a international student, I totally support such a new policy not only because I can benefit from it, but Amercian universities' reputation and financial conditions may benefit from it.

It is vital for us to have 24 monthes to undergo some fieldwork. This experience can help me polish my professional skills. If I have to go back home and find a job there right after finishing my grduate studies, I would be not as compeptive as domestic graduates because many of them have taken a internship. 
Then the companies may regard American master degree is easy to get and is not rewarding at all, of course this may undermine the reputation of American degree,and have an adverse impact on universities' addmission and financial conditions.
