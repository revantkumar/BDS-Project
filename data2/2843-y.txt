Jeff B I totally support this rule. 

First of all, a lot of international students come to U.S for study. They need some practice before coming back to their country. If there is no OPT extension, there will definitely be much much less students coming to U.S for study, which will cause significant economic damage. It is fair to extend OPT because they also pay huge tuition for their study!

Secondly, with no OPT extension, high tech companies can never hire enough high talent people. That will cause huge economic impact. That will also cause the loss of innovation because there is even no competition.
