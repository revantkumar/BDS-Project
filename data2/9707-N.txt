I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program for the following reasons: (1) It would lower wages in certain fields by artificially increasing the labor pool, (2) it would make it more difficult for American STEM graduates to find work, as potential positions would be filled by lower-paid foreigners workers for whom no payroll taxes would be paid - a double-whammy of disaster for American citizens, and lastly (3) because expansion of the time a student can work from 1 year to 3 makes it clear that most of these students would, in fact, become permanent residents, exacerbating the difficulties of American STEM graduates even further. The time has come for the government of the United States to stand up for the citizens that elect them, for whom they work, and by whom they will be held accountable in the future. Though we live in a global economy, our workers deserve the first shot at jobs located within our borders and should not be faced with insurmountable obstacles such as those placed before them in these proposed rule changes. No employer should have the incentives described in these rules changes to hire a foreign national ahead of an American citizen.
