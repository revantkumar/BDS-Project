I strongly support this ruling. This will boost the American economy, keep up American technological standards, and show the world that the US is a vibrant place of change and tolerance towards outsiders. If OPT were not extended, a huge and irreversible talent would occur, many of whom had their higher education in the US. Do not let other countries reap the benefits of what the US educational system has sowed. 

Sincerely,
