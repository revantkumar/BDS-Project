Abijith Tavarekere Ms. Katherine Westerlund,

As an international student in United States, I pursued Master's degree in the field of Electrical Engineering and currently working on my OPT. In my comment, I would like to justify the need for STEM extension and also state how the new STEM extension policy is beneficial to all.

STEM extension ensures international students an adequate period of industry experience without which the academic learning is not complete and also provides an opportunity to expertise in a given domain. For U.S. companies to remain globally competitive it is essential to generate domain experts and provide them with right opportunities. STEM extension is an ideal platform to fulfill both these needs and to strengthen U.S. economy.

People opposing STEM extension portray international workers competing with native workers for a fixed number of jobs, which in my opinion is not true. U.S is a land of opportunities and opportunities increase with growth, hence it is utmost important for U.S. economy to grow stronger and meet today's demands. In fact, international workers have equal contribution in terms growth and continue to play a positive role even in the future. 

Considering the biggest gain a stronger U.S. economy, DHS should work towards minimizing the impact towards students who are already in their 17-month extension and ensure the final rule is effective by Feb 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.
