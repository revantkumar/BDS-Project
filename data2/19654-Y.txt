I strongly support the new STEM extension program. Im an international student majoring in materials science and engineering. OPT extension program is attractive to international students to pursue their degree in USA and contribute their knowledge and skills to this country. If the OPT extension is cancelled, more talented international students will choose to study in other countries, such as Canada, Singapore. Itll be a disaster for both the academic institute and the industries in USA.
