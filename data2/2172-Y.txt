I HIGHLY SUPPORT FOR THIS RULE. 

I AM WORKING IN ONE US IT COMPANY AND MOST OF IT TECHNIC WORKS ARE DONE BY INTERNATIONAL NEW GRADUATE STUDENTS. WORLD'S MARKET IS GROWING AND OUR BUSINESS HAS TO MATCH THE MARKET PACE, MORE ENGINEERS ARE NEEDED. INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS ARE GREAT FIT FOR THE LACK OF EMPLOYEES. IF OPT EXTENSION WERE CANCELED, MOST US IT COMPANIES WOULD STOP GROWING OR EVEN DROP BACK. LESS TAX WOULD BE PAID. US ECONOMY WOULD BE IN WINTER AGAIN LIKE 2008.

MOST OF THEM ARE INNOVATED AND HARD WORKING. THEY ARE MAKING GOOG PROFIT FOR THE EMPLOERS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, EMPLOYED INTERNANTIONAL STUDENTS ARE PAYING TAX TO US GOVERNMENT, MAKING GDP FOR US, PAYING FOR ALL KINDS OF SPENSES INSTEAD OF EATING PUBLIC AWARE BENEFITS. ALSO OPT EXTENSION APPLICANTS ARE WELL EDUCATED AND USED TO US CULTULE, THEY WOULD ONLY BRING WELLNESS TO US.

ABOVE IS MY REASON FOR PASSING OPT EXTENSION RULE.
