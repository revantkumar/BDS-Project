xuan GAO its a extremely unwise desicion since international students make lots of contribution to the country. especially STEM students, they work in very important fields to US's future, working hard and paid less. To cancel the extention is a shortsighted idea, which have nothing benifit to the longterm development to US. The truth is a majority of graduate students are international students, which can contribut alot in development such as high tech field, which can determine a country's future.
ALL in all I strongly against cancel OPT extention for international students.
