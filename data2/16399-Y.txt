I am commenting to support, offering opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students with STEM Degrees will be a great help to both the US and F-1 students. Though some of the natives are worrying about their jobs will be 'stolen', they should think about the positive affection on economy which brings in more job opportunities, this actually is a win-win situation.
