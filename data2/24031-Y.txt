As I can see from my university. F-1 students are most talented students in their own countries.They are the main force for research in many areas, especially in science and technology. After graduated with good education and professional training, it will be a great loss for U.S to send them home without getting any payback. I have to admit that this benefits the students, but it has more benefits for U.S economy and innovation.
