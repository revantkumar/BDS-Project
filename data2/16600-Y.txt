If the OPT extension could not be approved, there will be a huge amount of international students work in the high tech companies need to leave US soon. Then those companies will be lack of technical employees, and this will affect the economy and technology development of US terribly. So I will strongly suggest and support the OPT extension proposal to be approved.
Thank you.
