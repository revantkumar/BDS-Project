This is an essential and necessary policy that should be approved ASAP. 

First of all, if it failed, lots of great engineers who're going to apply for this extension would lose their legitimate VISA immediately. They have been educated in this country and dictated for some top technical companies in this country for several years, this would cause damage to both those individuals and companies. Since it's lose-lose, there is no reason why it would fail. 

Secondly, for those people who just get their OPT and start to work, it's hard to image how they would feel at work while knowing they're going to be kicked out after less than 12 months. Also like the first reason, it would blemish both sides. 

Thirdly, out side of USA, there are a great amount of foreign students who're eager to study and work in USA someday. It's reasonable to believe if this policy failed, it would definitely discourage them. The reason why USA is the leader of varied technical areas is because people from all around the world come here and devote their wise and time. Education happens to be one of the main approaches. 

Last but not least important, why we need free market, it's because competition can encourage people to be more creative, aggressive and active. If people are trying to protect their own students or stuff by vetoing this, I feel so sorry that they cannot have a longer vision.
