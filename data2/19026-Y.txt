Hello,

I truly appreciate the fast action on working on a new rule for STEM OPT due to the litigation that occurred this past summer. As a DSO at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN I have had a lot of students commenting on this issue and they are also happy to hear DHS is also concerned and activity working to improve this ruling. I think the extension to 24 months is wonderful and it provides our students longer periods to continue their training. In addition, the ability to apply for a STEM extension more than once will also be well received by our students. 

I do have a few critiques that I will list below:

- There has been a lot of concern from current OPT students regarding the timing of this ruling and the timing of their application for STEM OPT extension. At this point, we have been advising students to wait until the last moment possible in hopes the new rule is effective by the time they need to apply to avoid double applications. I worry that there will be a lot of confusion during this transition period among what is required to extend for those currently on the 17 month extension as well as what students with pending STEM OPT applications need to do to meet the standards of the new rule. A timely roll out of the new rule would be much appreciated!

- The new ruling states that students will be able to apply for STEM extension based on a previous STEM degree. While I see the benefit to this, I don't see the practical nature of this as the student's 12 month OPT will still need to relate to their most recent degree. So for example, if a student has an engineering BA but them goes for an MBA, their 12 month OPT will need to relate to the MBA so when they go for an extension it would mean leaving a company they have only been with for 1 year. If you do end up going this route, I would suggest allowing the same flexibility to OPT, so the 12 month OPT could relate to any earned degree (from a US accredited institution).
