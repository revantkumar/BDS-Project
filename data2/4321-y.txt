Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate student at University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Most of U of Minnesota graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. I and many of my colleagues will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

I am planning to use OPT after graduation to gain some quality experience here in US and go back to my home country to contribute for the betterment of the science.
I'm currently on F1-OPT working as a software engineer in the company where I dreamed of working since my childhood. 
OPT and OPT extension is important because it will allow me to gain quality experience in my field of interest and make contribution in the field of Computer Science. 

I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule making process. I request DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.


Best regards
