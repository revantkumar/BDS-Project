As a HR in Apple, I strongly support the decision to improve the training opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. 

The group I'm supporting right now has a lot of openings in Electrical and computer engineering fields. It is very hard to find good entry level candidates that have US citizenship for the group. There are not enough US students are in this area. Sometimes we have to hire F1/OPT students instead even though hiring an international student needs much more work and takes more risk than hiring a US citizen for the company. 

I know some of my colleges have to hire engineers from Europe in certain area because it is hard to find the right employee here in US. Voiding the OPT extension will be a disaster for us.
