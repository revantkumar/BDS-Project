Jack Yu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. That is the most important reason that U.S could remain the strongest country in the world.

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International students focus more on the majors and fields that have U.S citizens. It is a good contribution U.S.
