WHY has the Department of Homeland Security proposed a rule to expand a 
program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers 
financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans, given the
sickeningly high US unemployment and abysmally low economic recovery 
figures??? I am against such a disgraceful attempt to hurt Americans
financially.

Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more 
than 120,000 young, foreign, college graduates per year who hold F-1 
visas - FORCE Americans out of the computer science field and creates 
a FALSE, self-fulfilling, so-called 'shortage' of STEM workers in America.

OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to 
a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign 
labor in lieu of Americans. The proposed rule of adding 24 months of 
discrimination against Americans effectively entices and allows 
employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status 
discrimination. Why is the Obama administration's DHS so bent on hurting 
American citizens, with DHS's OPT ?
