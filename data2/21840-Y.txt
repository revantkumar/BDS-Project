I fully support this proposal. 
A rise in the growth of foreign STEM workers by one percentage point of total employment increases growth in the wages of native college educated workers by a statistically significant 7-8 percentage points.
The STEM workers have an effect on total factor productivity and skill-biased productivity: "...inflows of foreign STEM workers may explain between 30 and 50% of the aggregate productivity growth and 4 to 8% of the skill bias growth that took place in the U.S. between 1990 and 2010."
