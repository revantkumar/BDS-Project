Henry Li I strongly support the OPT extension.
Foreign students need more time to train themselves. The time for current OPT extension is just 17 months, many students cannot have enough time to train themselves. And also many projects in big companies are one-year. Students may find it hard for them to find out suitable projects in the half year. If the OPT extension is changed to 24 months, these students can be trained more skillful.
STEM students always create new job situations. For big company like Google, STEM students indeed take a many engineer positions. But! These young engineers create many products. When the companies want to sell these products, they need some salespersons. When the companies need to manage money earned by new products, they need accounts. It will really create a lot of new job positions.
If we push all foreign technological students back to their own country, sooner or later, their own countries' technology will exceed the US. Then, many companies in the US will go bankrupt and the US will lose a lot of job positions.
