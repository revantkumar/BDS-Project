Qihui Zhao I think the expansion of OPT is both good for the United States and international students.

Students with STEM degrees coming from other countries are a huge resourse for America. They have different culture backgroud, which under the amrican education system will create more exciting things. And giving them more time to stay in America is giving them the chance to do more things reasonable, and giving America more chance to find valuable people who can contribute to this country.

According to statistics, there are more than 60 percent international students choosing to go back to their own countries. This means those who stayed are actually have the value to be remained, and have the ability to make profits for the society.

So please expand OPT, and give those students the chance to do things good for America.
