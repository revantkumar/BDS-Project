I strongly agree with this proposal and the reasons supporting the proposal are clear and reasonable. My concern is about obtaining the STEM OPT extension based on prior qualifying STEM degree (https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/10/19/2015-26395/improving-and-expanding-training-opportunities-for-f-1-nonimmigrant-students-with-stem-degrees-and#p-217). I strongly agree with this point and here is the reason why this action is good. This could make interdisciplinary fields more attractive to international talents. Unlike traditional fields like natural science, these fields requires students to have deep understanding in various fields, one example is the human computer interface (HCI) which is an important and innovative study area. It requires students have knowledge related to psychology, arts and computer science. A student who comes from one of the fields I mentioned has the great chance want to learn another fields degree because these fields are separated by an traditional category but are all important to him/her the research area. If OPT extension could cover the students who devote themselves to these interdisciplinary fields, it could bring more talents to the U.S. and help the U.S. educational system maintain its reputation and innovation among the world.
