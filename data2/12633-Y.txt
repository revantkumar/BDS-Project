After reading all the materials included in this proposed rule,I highly recommend approving this rule.
I am an international student who is pursuing a Master degree in University of Texas at Dallas.I originally come from China. My major falls into the STEM degrees, which means this rule will apply to me after I graduate. The expanding OPT for F-1 Non-immigrant students could make America's society better off. 
First of all, there will be more time for good-educated students to contribute their intelligence and skills to employers, which can improve the efficiency and increase the revenue of companies in USA tremendously.Companies with the advantage of hiring high-quality and low-wage qualified F-1 students can be more diversified and talented. 
Second, STEM degrees extensions could be a critical factor for universities in America to be considered by international students when they apply for America's universities. There is no doubt that college education plays an important role for people. It will take considerate time to choose a university. Most of the students before they become a F-1 student will apply and compare many universities from different countries, such as UK, Germany, Australia. One of the reasons that they decide to come to USA obtaining a diploma is the training opportunities after they graduate. There is a legal process to guarantee the opportunity which is the OPT. And we need this process to be improved.
Third, expanded OPT can make universities in USA more competitive and attract more students form all over the world to come here. With the increased number of international students, many universities can increase their revenue and provide more high-quality education to Americans.
