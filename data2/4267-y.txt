Andrea Stewart If this rule is not issued , international students will go and they will settle somewhere else. This will be a huge blow to the legal immigration process which everyone claims to support. International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths.
