I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons.
1 This proposal can make foreign students stay in the U.S legally and keep working for this country even after they graduate. And it is obvious that this benefits U.S a lot. 
2 Diversity is one of the key reasons which makes U.S the most powerful country in the world, including culture, military, economy and politics. 
3 Only excellent students can stay and find jobs here, so that the corporations here would be more competitive. Everyone deserves the equal opportunity.
