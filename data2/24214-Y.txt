I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First, as a senior engineer in a software company, I have a lot of colleagues who are international students using stem extension, they are all good engineer and really contribute to the company, I do believe they are part of the company, without them, I think my company cannot work well as before. We really need them.

Second, I have some talented colleagues who are citizen now but they are international students in the past. I think stem is the best way for them to be part of us, to be U.S. citizen. I believe U.S need them, because they are so smart, they make our country better and better. If just make them go home, I believe it will be a huge lose for our country.

Finally, when we hiring new colleague, we find most of time, we can only hire international students, because only them are qualified for those jobs, we tried to hire some citizens, but we cannot find people who is qualified. So, for the company, we need international students, we need them to work for us.

Thus, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
