I also want to comment on some mainstream opponent comments

There has been some opponents provide sample comments just to artificially raising the opponents pool, sounding like there is a large group of opposing opinions while they are essentially only one: STEM extension are increasing competition for US workers. 

First of all, the program is never designed for employers NOT to employ US workers; companies hire their best candidates regardless of nationality but only focus on their ability and potential. It is not STEM students' fault that they work much harder and perform better on their interviews and on jobs. I have seen on CS project teams foreign students did all the work and domestic students never show up on discussions. They all graduated with CS major, but if the opponents are going to blame on foreign students for performing too good so the domestic student who never did work could not find their ideal jobs, then why need working visa? There are so many homeless on the streets who do not have a job. 

They may say this is only one case, this is the fact: I graduated from UC Berkeley, and in almost every CS classes there are team members who does not do work and only relied on their teammates, and domestic students are a great portion among them. Companies are not as stupid that they only hire foreign students to cut on their cost, they do not hire incompetent workers, that's it. And top performing students never need to worry about jobs, that's another fact.
