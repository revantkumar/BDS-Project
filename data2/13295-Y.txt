I strongly support this rule because variety is a very benefitial factor for us to offer different kinds of views and angles to a subject, thus to come up with more creative ideas and comprehensive solutions. On the other hand, there are actually plenty kinds of positions that many American are not willing to do, but foreigher can help. For example, most of Americans don't like to work on weekends, especially on Sunday. But for some foreigher with different culture, they don't really care to work on weekends. Could you imagine that on weekend, no one is working and factories and stores are closed because they are short of human resources? Another example could be, IT Engineers. In the US, IT engineers are very needed human resources but the demand cannot be satisfied solely by Americans...simply because general Americans don't really interest in this area, which because American dream is about successful financial business, not typing codes.
