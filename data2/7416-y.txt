Ming Cai I support this proposal to expand training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees with the following reason:
It is going to help United States to stay competitive in technology and science.Every year there are lots of top students graduated in the United States who are not citizens of this country. Giving them equal opportunities to work and research in this country means United States will always have the best talented people to advance technology and science. Currently, those companies hire international students not because they don't want to hire Americans. It is because they can't find enough Americans who are good enough for the positions. If we let go of those top students and hire those Americans who are not yet ready for the positions, how could American companies make sure they stay industry leading across the world, especially now more and more promising companies are rising in Asia. The competition in technology and science is a competition for the talented. We should give them opportunities to benefit this country.
