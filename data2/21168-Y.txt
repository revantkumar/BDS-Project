I strongly support the idea of providing extra opportunities to F-1 Nonimmigrant students. It is the tolerance and diversity of America that make the United States the most mighty country in this world. With this tolerance, people from different cultures and religions are able to sit together and communicate with each other, different thoughts react with each other and produce wisdom. And you can't bring this kind of wisdom into existence only by people with the same background. Thoughts need to be exchanged and voices need to be heard , this is the basic value of American spirit. This appears to be more important in today's high tech companies, such as facebook and google. One of the core value of these companies is that all perspectives are respected, including those from other countries. Also , this people are quite talented are working hard to be where they are, the values they produce can be much more than citizens who sleep on the ideas that they are US citizen so they should earn much without effort. So, I reiterate my opinion, more opportunities should be given to those nonimmigrant STEM students.
