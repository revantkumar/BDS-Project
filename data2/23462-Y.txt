I strongly support this new rule. First, the new rule could help US universities to attract more international students with strong background in their field of study. Second, more students will be able to contribute to tech companies in US, which could boost the development of new technologies. Third, the companies will be able to hire more people to meet their requirement to expand, which is also beneficial to the economy.
