I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. short OPT is hard for the students from other country to get a job in US, even lots of students are talented and creative. I don't think this is good for US economy.
2. Longer OPT will make studying ing US much more attractive. More students from other countries will come to US.
3. And the longer OPT brings equality for the students, and it is fair.
