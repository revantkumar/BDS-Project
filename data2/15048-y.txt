shuhao lin I strongly support the extension of OPT

1. International Students are very smart guys selected by top universities of USA. They are the main force of the high technology companies. Without them, the top companies will not continue to be the most innovative companies and hence could not lead the word. 
2. Almost all international students are hired by high tech companies. The average salary of international students are quite high, as far as I know, the average salary of my friends are more than $100000 a year, far above the median salary of united state. So the jobs that most international students occupied has nothing to do with orderly citizens of united state of america. In fact, the continuously contribution of international student to high technology contribute to the prosperous economy of USA. As a result, make the life of citizens of USA much better.
