It's a rewarding policy for both international students and Americans. For international students, they get more times to gain more experiences of studying and working in America. It's really important to have the extention time because it takes long time for students to find a job and settle down after the graduation; it takes even longer time for them to adapt for those STEM related jobs. STEM extention provides them the precious times. On the other hand, for america people, they benefit from all the hardworking from those international students. Without their contributions in those high-tech areas, it can be easily seen that companies need pay more money to hire peoples, let alone that it is a doubt that enough talent people can be hired. The policy definitely benefit the growth of America economics. It alos benefits to the education section. Without the extention, universities in America is less attactive since it is not only expensive, but also offer limited training opportunities after graduation. Without doubt, the growing population in universities in ameica brings huge avenues to ameirica univeristies; and the amount of money they spend on daily life can contribute to economic growth and create jobs. Some people claims that those international students take away america people's jobs. Is it really true? They probably do not understand how hard it is for international students to get the jobs if some america people with equal or even weaker competitence are competing with them. In this sense, for theose people who are arguing that international students steal their jobs, I would suggest them to polish their skill sets first. Also, due to the limited amount of H1B visa, most of international students are not able to stay in america for long times.
