Please explain regarding these issues:
Companies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse {H-1B} and OPT to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas.
Further, how is the US going to keep track of these people?
Last, how much in loss of payroll and other taxes is this going to cost?
