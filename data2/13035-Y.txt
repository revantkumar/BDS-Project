I strongly support this rule for the following reasons.
First, international students who take time and effort studying in America worth an opportunity of achieving their dreams in this nation. All people no matter what nationality he or she is deserves an equal chance.
Second, highly educated and skilled international students could be a very positive and helpful source to the science institutions, technology corporations and even to the society. The innovations and progress can origin from wisdom and intelligence of people all around the world.
Third, extending OPT will certainly attracts more international students who want to experience studying abroad. And the multiple existence of different cultures makes American values so attractive.
