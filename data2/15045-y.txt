Xue Liang I do support the new policy of expanding training opportunities for F-1 Students. The main reason for my approval is that: This policy would be beneficial to the economy development in US. As far as I know, at least in Michigan area, the traditional manufacturing automotive companies like Ford and GM are being welcome to international students as they are expanding their global business in China, India and etc. They are looking for nonimmigrant students for their potential help in such business in future.

Also, as I'm a F-1 student whose looking for working experience in America to help my future career back to China, I'm sure that this policy will give me a great opportunity to help a further understanding in global industry after graduation. I'll have a longer time to gain experience other than what has been taught in class. I'm planning to go back to China after the few years of training period. This policy would be extremely helpful to me.
