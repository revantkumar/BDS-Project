I strongly support this new proposal!
Please ensure the Mentor and training plan to be parts of the new proposal. This is way can help company find more suitable and professional candidates during the training and mentoring process.
It is a more professional way for employer to find the module candidates for their own business. Sometimes it can provide greater match candidates than just by interviews and internship.

Please implement this new proposal ASAP.
