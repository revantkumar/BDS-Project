I highly suggest federal government to expanding OPT training time based on following reasons:
1.US has always been attractive to STEM students due to this policy. without enough OPT time, many engineering students will directly back to their own country(china, india), which certainly not benifits US economy and her interest.
2.F-1 students support local economy with private school-amount tuition and international student fee. there is no reason that letting them leave country once they graduated.
3.people may argue that international students will take US citizen's job position. this concern is reasonable. However, we must realize that there are many jobs positions that are created by international students: Navida, Tesla....many of these companies' founder are not born in US, but they changed this country.

give STEM students a chance, and they will make this country a better place.
