My daughter is an engineering student. So on behalf of her and the other Americans studying at US schools, I ask you not to vote for an increase in the OPT time allotted to foreign students. In fact, I think it is time to get rid of OPT altogether. The US students shouldn't have to compete with the foreign students for jobs and certainly shouldn't have to compete with employers being given a financial incentive to hire foreign workers by not having to pay their payroll taxes. Of course that brings me to the fact that an increased worker supply depresses wages. Immigration policy should serve the interests of American workers, not foreign workers.
