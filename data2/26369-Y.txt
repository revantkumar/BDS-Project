I strongly support the proposal that improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with stem degrees and capgap relief for all eligible f-1 students for the following reason: 

Firstly, the opt extension polices could make US education more competitive than other countries like UK, which bring US university a lot of money. More and more students, especially in Engineering background, in China are choosing to pursue a US degree instead of going to other foreign countries like Europe mainly because of the attractive of the good opt and OPT extension policy, from which, at least US universities earn a lot from that. Actually, European and Australia could also offer good bachelor and master degrees even with less tuition fees and easier applying process. One of the biggest advantage making US education more attractive is the good OPT policy.

Secondly, it is good for US industry. US industry need those foreign talents to design, to make , and to create. In silicon valley, in New York and in Boston, we could see a lot of competitive product with the effort of foreign students. Foreign students are together with native workers to create the excellent industrial products, and they are together to improve the standard of US industry, and they learn each other and help each other to make a change of the US, also make a change of world.

So, I strongly support this new policy.
