Undoubtedly, this is a constructive improvement for U.S workforce. U.S society needs the fresh flood from diverse and superior non immigrant students with STEM degree. The stem students will be priceless fortune for U.S society. All stem non immigration students are talents in different countries and have strong aspiration and ambition to return their intelligence to U.S economy. Most students dream of having their own labs and business in U.S. However, the very limited 12 months OPT period strangled their enterprise dreams to come true. They urgently need the 24 months extension time to prepare, adjust and realize their innovative idea into the reality. If U.S government can approve this meaningful extension, increasing number of students dare to take the time to set up and realize their dream in U.S. This can significantly and substantially relieve the high unemployment rate in U.S. In other words, U.S. government just provide one job chance for those stem student. As a return,these stem students will be able to create thousands of job opportunities to U.S government through their own hi-tech business. In addition, U.S is short of the stem human resources. Actually, more and more midtier and super-scale IT companies strive to hire talents from other foreign countries at all cost because they profoundly understand the importance of stem talents and know how much immeasurable potential fortune the stem talents can bring to their business. Therefore, there is no reason that the U.S government keep the stem students outside U.S just because of the limitation of OPT extension. Instead, U.S government should lengthen the OPT extension as long as you can. I sincerely hope the U.S government are able to listen to my sincere suggestions. Thank you so much for your time and assistance in supporting the OPT extension.
