Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a Graduate Student at the University of New Haven. 45% of MIT graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. I and many of the students who or on F1 OPT will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
I am planning to use the 24 months STEM Extension to enhance my skills by working in a real environment. It is very important for me to use 24 months STEM OPT to get the best out of my Engineering programme.

I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule making process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

Please reduce the burden of maintaining the documentation for STEM Extension Students and Employers.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Please approve the proposed rule and help the STEM students to work in the United States of America.

Best regards,
Venu Babu Gattineni, 
University of New Haven,
