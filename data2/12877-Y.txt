I strongly SUPPOR Tthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S. 

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. lots of famous peopel in different kinds of industries was international student. They won't have today's awards without the opportunity given by U.S.

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. Lots of position are sutible for international student.
