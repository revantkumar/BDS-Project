Abhinav Sharma I do support the OPT Stem extension rule because It gives an excellent opportunity to the International STEM Graduates to work and gain good quality exposure and skills in their respective field of study and also serve as quality manpower in accordance to today's modern day industrial needs of the nation. I have always seem USA as a nation of opportunities for the deserved ones. So, bringing this rule in existence will give a quality chance to the International students to also live the Great American Dream of a nation who has till now gratified them in every possible way. 

I also want to thank you for giving me a chance to openly express my views on this respective rule, I really appreciate it.
