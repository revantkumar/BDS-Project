I strongly support this proposal by DHS and I think it is beneficial for both international students and US itself. US gives not only a chance for higher education, but also provides an open environment for people competing for opportunities. I, as an internation student, came to US in pursit of this type of American dream and hoped I could get a decent job via hard work. I did it and many other international students did it. In fact, there are statistics showing that foreigners are contributing a huge portion of US's STEM industries. We proved that international students have positive impact on these fields. Rejecting this expansion will force lots of current employees as well as potential employees (those who are studying or planning to study in the US) move away.
