OPT has long served as a way for employers to work around caps on guest-workers, since Congress has failed to give in to employers demands that the number of annual H-1B visa holders admitted annually be raised exponentially. President Obama and members of both parties in Congress in are looking for ways to circumvent existing law to bring in more foreign workers. OPT workers represent an attractive option to employers since these foreign graduates, unlike their American counterparts, are exempt from payroll taxes because they are still classified as "students" by DHS. Even worse, OPT has no provisions to protect qualified American workers from being displaced, or wage requirements for hiring OPT workers -which is what leads to the displacement of American workers, or Americans not being hired in the first place. What is wrong with this country?
