OPT is just wrong; and it should be abolished. Many educated American Citizens looking for work can not get hired, because of this training program. And that is the most wrong thing about the OPT program. This is a time when American Citizens need to get employment. The OPT program gives an unfair advantage to low wage Foreign Nationals and their employers. Americans should be first for employment. My opinion is; we have too many foreign nationals taking Americans jobs now.
