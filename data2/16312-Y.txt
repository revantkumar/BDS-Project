I strongly support STEM program.

The STEM program let international students make more contribution to their employer. Usually it will take a company at least a half to 1 year to train a new employee before the new employee can start to make contribution to the company. Obviously, the current 1-year OPT program does help. However, think about it, if the new hired employee is an international student who is on OPT, by the time he/she is about to make contribution to his/her employer, he/she has to leave America because his legal status is gonna expire soon. This is a significant loss to the company. However, with the 24-months extension, he/she can continue to contribute and bring more profit to the company.
