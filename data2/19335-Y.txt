I think the OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees should be expanded. More and more hi-tech US companies are recruiting more and more international students. They need the students from STEM majors. If the extension is not approved, then much fewer students will come to US for undergraduate or graduate study. The universities will suffer from lack of students. It's a also huge loss of elites from the world. The industries need STEM degree people to help push the technology to its boundaries. I know that there are a lot of Indian students and Chinese students entering the US each year. If they are not guaranteed an extension of the OPT, they will go back to their country. Especially China is vastly growing and may surpass the US one day. The elite group will of course be the force for China's fast development. On the other way, it is interesting to see that so many Americans are against the OPT extension. They are worried about their jobs, but they don't see that one day they won't have any jobs because all the companies will move to China, India, Europe, and so on.
