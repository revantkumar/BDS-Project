I am fully supporting the revised OPT Stem extension. It will give all the International students enough timeframe to apply lessons learnt in classroom in the practical scenarios ie in the organizations who always encourage new ideas and provide space the graduates to learn and grow. Apart from that, the amount of money invested in higher studies in US would be fully utilized in a good way when the students will spend time and get benefit by working in the organizations.
