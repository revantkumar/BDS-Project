Nitish Nalwade I strongly support OPT extension rule. There are many reasons for that, Once education is complete international students needs corporate experience where he can apply his knowledge gained from universities. Experience will give student more understanding of whatever he is been learning from professors of the university.

This training opportunity will help international student to get good career once he's back to his home country. Student pays huge amount tuition fees to get their degrees from american university, this opt extension will give a student time to repay the loan and become independent and economically strong. 

Foreign students also contribute to the economy of our country in form of fees and taxes which helps government to construct the nation. Our nation needs highly skillful workers who has degrees in engineering, sciences and mathematics. Foreign students helps to grow the nation and this rule ultimately will be responsible to grow the whole nation. 

This proposal in going in right path, so I strongly support this rule.
