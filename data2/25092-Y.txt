I am a Ph.D student in statistics and I strongly support this rule. As a Ph.D student I have been studying in my field for a couple of years and have decided to find a job in United States after my graduation. As a fresh graduate, we do need time to adapt ourselves to the industry and this 12 + 24 months rule gives us enough time to find a suitable job and fully deliver our skills on the position. 3 years probably is the usual length of time that needed for us to apply our knowledge learned from US university to the US high-tech industry development. The OPT extension rule will benefit both the US development and international STEM students.
