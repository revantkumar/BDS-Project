Yuqiang Bi I strongly support the new ruling to extend STEM OPT up to 24 months. International STEM students need practical training after the completion of degree to become competitive work force. In return, the US companies and institutions relies on international talents to stay ahead of global competition. If students who are studying in the US all go back to their home countries after 1 years of training, they will soon create value for their countries that will one day compete with the US. It does not make sense to uses US education to nurture its competitors.
