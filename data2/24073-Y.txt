I am strongly SUPPOT STEM OPT policy.

Rejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next facebook!

Do you want US lose 1st in the world? Do you only focus on one job position or the whole future of US?
NONONO! Every one has an American dream in US, and US should be a better place for everyone who deserve an American dream!
