The idea of mentoring and training post-Bac's or those with advanced degrees is a ridiculous! Once you graduate, training is over and it's time to work in the real world. How does one set up a training program for a PhD embarking on his/her own research as a postdoctoral fellow? These are people that have gone to school for years and years and now they're going to be treated like an intern with a set schedule?
