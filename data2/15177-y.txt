Joan Dori This kind of nonsense has been going on way too long - starting with bringing in Indian programmers to replace US citizens at HP. Why should companies be given monetary incentives to hire foreign competition at reduced wages? We encourage students to attend college, but what kind of a future are they looking at? As a country, we will have educated citizens who cannot earn a living in their field of choice. As an educator at the middle school level, I am frustrated - what is the point???!!!
