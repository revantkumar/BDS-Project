I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness. So, Please think to one more time on increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 36 months instead of the current 17 months which can give enough time for students to utilize the education and can give maximum help in the growth on nation both technically and economically.
