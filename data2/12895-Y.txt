I fully support the amendment of F-1 nonimmigrant student visa regulations on OPT for STEM students. This amendment will benefit the U.S. in both short term and long term. This will also give the students longer and better trainings. We STEM graduates need a longer time to immerse in work and gain confidence with the acquired skills, which help us succeed in our career paths. Therefore, this is a mutual benefits and I cannot see how the arguments of resisting such amendment can stand.
