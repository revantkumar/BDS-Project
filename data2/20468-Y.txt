I graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in engineering. I'm currently working for an American company. It doesn't take me too long to become the critical person in my department because of my education and intelligence. My company will suffer a lot if loosing me suddenly so they were more than happy to sponsor my working visa this year. But as you know, there were over 220K petitioners competing for 80K seats. And I was so unlucky. With this OPT extension, at least my company can get another chance to sponsor my working visa. And I have the confidence that America will benefit a lot from keeping us international elites in this country to work for a couple of years. Canceling OPT extension will definitely cause disasters to most of American companies.
