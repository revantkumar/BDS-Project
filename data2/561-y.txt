Wei Lu I support this propose! 

The F-1 STEM students are the best quality of young people from all over the world. This country needs them to sustain a high speed growing Hi-Tech or Scientific industry. We provide the best education for them and send them right away to their country, is not benefiting our system. Some of them contributes the most edging acknowledge to the field they serve. It's unwise to send them back, to give away the potential future achievement.
Also, we have a very loosen restrictions to the illegal immigrants, but we treat these smart students too harsh. This is just not FAIR. We should provide them the opportunities to work here. And make a way for them to stay if they are qualified.
