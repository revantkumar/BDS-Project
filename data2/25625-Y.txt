It is about time that the United States thinks of our own citizens and helps them get jobs. How about all the black people that didn't get an education and could learn a trade? Then also there are many white people needing work. My own son worked for a company, which I won't name, but they had him train a person from another country to do his job then laid him off and he had a hard time finding work but did and took a tremendous cut in pay. Yes, he is still working that job even if underpaid.

What about all the Citizens who lost home and all and living on the street and can't find a job to support his family, a wife and children?

My Dad learned a trade from the WPA and fed his family and was able to sell the small home (4 rooms) which during WW2, 12 and when her husband came home one more and my brothers 3. The next house had 5 room plus 2 in the basement and we all lived in it until they built a basement for them to live in and then since she had had 2 more children all seven moved out. 

Daddy worked his trade until he died at age 52, 2 of my brothers also learned that trade and I could look at the Paseo bridge, 435 bridge and know my Dad helped in the one and brother helped in the other, as the other brother and family moved to Calif. and he worked in the oil fields.

Why do you love and think of the ILLEGALS OVER OUR OWN CITIZENS?
