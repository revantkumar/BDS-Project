Looking at Singapore's prosperity under Lee Kuan Yew's talent acquisition policies, you will realize the value of a diversified and global brain pool to the economic and social progress of a nation.

If you think the two countries are just too different to be comparable, the intake of many scholars by America during and after world war two poses another great illustration on how global talents can gather at and promote a nation's scientific/technology/social progress. 

The OPT extension just provides an additional meritocratic channel for US companies to pick the skilled or talented people they need from the international brain pool, in addition to the local talents here. That is, it provides a fair ground for them to learn, to show and use their skills and talent to create value, here in the US, instead of in other countries like Canada, China, India, etc. It is giving the market force and the invisible hands the greater role in growing the US economy, rendering it more competitive across the globe. 

If you really think that OPT harms your job prospect, focusing not on Yes/No but on how and how to enforce the meritocratic nature of the OPT may be a better option. After all, there are many corporations in the US created by immigrants and their children, which offer thousands of jobs. 

I STRONGLY support the proposal.
