Marilyn Smith The facts are out there in all these letters you are receiving. The government is hurting US citizens job prospects by bringing in foreign workers and their families. At some point US government workers will need the same protections. How would you feel if thousands of foreign workers were brought in to do your jobs and you had to train them??

This corrupt practice to obtain cheaper labor is hurting our country. Why have a US government department of education, spend billions on US universities and colleges if you are going to bring in foreign trained workers to take away their jobs?

The people born and raised in the USA need jobs to be able to raise their families. Who is going to buy the products these cheap labor companies make if there is no one making enough money to afford them?

You are creating a glut of unemployed people who will be lining up for government assistance. Rather then paying into the system to support a good economy these people will be taking unearned benefits. 

It hurts our country to flood the USA with even more people. Our population is growing. We do not need to hurry up to fill it up. This mass of immigration will need services such as our parks, schools, maintenance on roadways and infrastructures.

We also need to consider what it means to flood the country with people who do not share a sense of history of what it means to be an American. We need citizens who appreciate our freedoms and respect our laws.

Please stop this scheme!
