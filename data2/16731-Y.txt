This act not only benefits the stem students but also the employers. Lots of employers tend not to hire international students not because they don't have the qualification, but due to the risk of losing them after their OPT, since the chance of passing the H1B visa is getting lower each year. The demand in the job market today is growing and we should keep the talented people for as long as possible. In order to provide a fair job markets for both the people who are looking for jobs and for employers. Companies will be able to hire whom they believe have the ability and qualifications.
