I support this rule for the reason that STEM students have made a great contribution to technological advancement and economical improvement of the nation. I am sure there will be more talented STEM students working for this great country and make it better and better under this rule.

The most attractive characteristic of U.S. is the immigrant-friendly culture, and everyone can get equal chance. I think it is also an important reason why this country is the best country in the world.
