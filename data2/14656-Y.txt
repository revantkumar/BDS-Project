My fellow citizens are very ill informed when they complain about foreign STEM workers. I never had to compete with a STEM worker and I have been in the field for 10 years. Never have I seen a foreign STEM worker hired over a US citizen. 
Hiring a foreign national involves a huger risk since one cannot commit for long term, and significant paperwork is required to hire them in the first place. In this innovation driven economy its asinine to think that a company would hire a less qualified person just to save a few grands, even if that is true. 

Thanks.
