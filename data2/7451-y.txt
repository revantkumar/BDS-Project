Micheal Hernandez the new OPT extension will boost the education industry and bring the profit to related industry, like retailing. 
However, the most important part of this policy is to attract top talents coming to develop the technology. Apple, facebook, twitter and google, those companies bring a huge profit but at the same time rely on the international engineers. If this policy is cancelled, it will lead to a big talent gap and affect those multinational companies. We should know this extension bring the knowledge, the technology and the wealth to United States. So I strongly support the new policy
