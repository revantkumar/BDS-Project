I fully support this proposal because I believe it will benefit people on both sides, F-1 students and people from the US.

First, the experienced F-1 students with extended OPT would fill the position gap in the US industry that people from the US leave behind, which will definitely help boost the US economy.

Also, these F-1 students would pay all the taxes required by the government and contribute to the development of public service and fundamental infrastructure in the US.

What's more, the spirits of America, diversity and freedom, are delivered and realized here in a culture way. And they will influence these students in deep and spread these values when the students get back to their home countries after got trained during OPT.
