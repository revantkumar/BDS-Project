I read some of the comments that keep saying that companies should hire U.S. citizens first and OPT STEM extension should not be favored. That is SO Wrong. In any case, the company should hire the best empolyee as long as they are legal to work in U.S. Most of these foreigh students are the top students from the best univerisites in their countries. They are smart, hard-working and well educated in U.S. universities. Because of H1B cap, OPT extension is their only hope to be working in U.S. If they have to leave the American because of H1B cap or the expirate of OPT, U.S. goverment is making a hugely wrong decision that will eventually weaken the competetiveness of U.S. companies in the world because they fail to attract and hire the best and the most talented people.
