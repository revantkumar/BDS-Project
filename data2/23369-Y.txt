I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension. First, this rule would attract more international students to come to US, which potentially stimulates consumption and the economy, and benefits all the US citizens. Second, foreign students never compete and take the jobs away from American citizen, instead, most students occupy the positions which are hungry for technicians and workers. With F-1 students working in these area, American economy would be greatly boosted, otherwise, these positions could not have enough qualified workers and the related area could simply be withered. Finally, Americans welcome the qualified workers and generous students, which is the long history and culture of America. And it is the reason why America is leading the world, and attracting all the people in the world.
