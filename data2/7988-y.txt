Xiangyu Zhang I totally support STEM OPT extension. These graduate students have the talent that are in urgent need especially for IT technologies. For example in my company, Crowe Horwath, half of the technology support team members are foreigners. They are smart, energetic and hard-working employees. Most of them are on their H1b job visa staring from OPT. This Extension will give more chances to the people like them helping them work legally in US.
