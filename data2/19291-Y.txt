Approving the OPT STEM extension is a good cause. The student will get time to show off their talent that they develop while studying. By practicing just for twelve months, a student cannot successfully deliver what he learnt. Approving an extension of 24 months will provide sufficient time for students to develop their skills and use them in the real industrial world.
