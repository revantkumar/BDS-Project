I strongly support the new 24 months extension rule for STEM.

First, the U.S. will suffer from tremendous financial loss if revokes old STEM OPT
rule and fails to publish the new one. 

Currently there are over 400,000 STEM students studying in U.S. either in a 2
years master degree or in a 4 years undergraduate degree. The average 
tuition per year they spend is $30,000. Totally U.S. education system 
receives 400,000 * 30,000 = 12,000,000,000 = 12 billion USD per year. One of the 
most important reasons they choose U.S. for higher education is 
because it provides the best after-school training opportunity (17 months 
STEM OPT). If U.S. education system can not provide STEP OPT extension in 
the future. It will lose in the competition against other countries that are
providing it. Considering that a large portion of STEM students will 
abandon their future plan to study in U.S. That is a huge impact on the 
current U.S. education ecosystem that has already adapted to wide 
internationalization.

Second, it is required 3 years OPT to train a qualified STEM worker.

3 years OPT training provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after school 
training. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college
graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist (compared with the 3-5 years 
residency period of medical school graduates).

Third, STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident. H1B 
does. Don't blame at the wrong thing.

Many have the misunderstanding that OPT students are taking away job 
opportunities that belongs to U.S. citizens or residents. That is completely WRONG. OPT/
STEM OPT is for training and serving as a part of university education. The 
OPT students who want to be working in U.S. in long term has to be converted
to H1B Visa, which the major contributor that takes away jobs from local 
residents. According to 2015 data. Among the filed 215000 H1B applicants, 
only 30000 (less than 13%) are STEM OPT st
