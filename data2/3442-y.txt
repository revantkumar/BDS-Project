Craig Casho Short, sweet, simple. Use the many, many available unemployed work force that the current administration and those running on the Democratic ticket for their chance at taking the current's place have just written off the books instead of bringing in foreign labor. Give business the same tax breaks to hire our out of work citizens...........................period.

No Foreign Labor................................PERIOD!
