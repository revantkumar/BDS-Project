Definitely support the new opt extension regulation. Why just 24 months? I thought the original proposal was 36~48 months. 

Let's take University of Michigan College of Engineering as an example. The average GPA of the whole engineering college is 3.3, while the average GPA of the Chinese students in the engineering college is 3.9! Moreover, those international students pay 8x more tuition (about $45,000 a year) than those in-state citizens, which means those students are not cheap labor force, actually they are not cheap at all. Speaking the truth, these international STEM students are not just rich in their skills and knowledge, they are also rich in money. Their money actually support the research and the expansion of the university.

High tech recruiters of course would be in favour of these hardworking and rich STEM students. Engineering can change the world, creating real,touchable economic growth, while money-related majors do not. Don't take it for granted that engineering students do not have a sense of liberal arts, through my eyes, what they are doing is the real arts. 

United states is always a place for immigrants, all the citizens' ancestors are immigrants. USA will always be in favour of hardworking and rich person, no matter you are citizens or not. 

Were I an American mother, I would rather prefer my kids to study with those hardworking international STEM students, which would make my kids tough, strong and competitive in the future job markets.
