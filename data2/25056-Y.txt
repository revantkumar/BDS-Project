I support this rule for the following reasons:
1. By expanding training opportunities for STEM F-1 Students can largely relieve the stress of competing for H1B visa. 
2. Expending the period of OPT Extension can attract more potential young professions to come to the US to study and seek their own opportunities, which are very good to the development of the US also.
3. Also with greater length of OPT Extensions, graduates may have time to figure out what they really want to do, whether to stay in the US or go back to where they came. Also the companies would have time to evaluate their foreign employees. It's like a screening process. The results would come better if we give it enough time. 
Therefore, I support this 24-month extension for OPT employees.
