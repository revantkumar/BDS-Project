Lucy M I strongly support this policy!

STEM F1 students absolutely make great contribution to the US. I know many students of STEM F1 identity who work in famous technical companies. They are paid well and get good evaluation from their bosses. It will be a great loss if they cannot stay in the US due to the bad OPT policy. Longer OPT extension will provide them more chance of making a contribution to the US.
