This rule of implementing 24 month OPT STEM extension is a must for many graduating students because it is getting difficult to change status to H1B for these students due to the H1B lottery system. The number of applications for H1B visa is increasing exponentially every year and with only one year of OPT it is almost impossible to convert to H1B status within that year. But with 24 month of OPT STEM extension, graduate students have at least 2 more chances to file for H1B visa.

Only 12 months of OPT is also not beneficial for the US economy. Companies that hire recent graduates put it one year of effort to train them and if these students are forced to leave the country because of not able to maintain work status, then all the knowledge and cost goes to waste. With the new 24 month OPT STEM extension rule companies will be able to use the immense talent from graduate students and build the US economy more stronger.

For all the above reasons, I am in full support of the 24 month OPT STEM extension and will ask the government to implement the rule as soon as possible.
