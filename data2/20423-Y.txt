I am an international student graduating in this coming year. OPT extension is being very important to me because I wanted to have a career and make positive impact in the IT industry. Many companies are hesitated to hire international students mostly because the concern of H1B sponsorship. From our international students' perspective and the these growing businesses' perspective, it's a huge pity because we are unable to use what we've learned at the US educational institutions to make more profit for many businesses here. Also, if OPT cannot be extended, thousands of highly-qualified international individuals will have no choice but give up their career halfway and return to their home country, which is a huge tragedy for both individual career development and companies that hope to hire them. I understand that there are many concerns about international students creating more burdens to the US government or leaves less opportunity to the native American people. However, I think the benefits outweighs the problems here because we help create an active and quickly growing entrepreneurial environment.
