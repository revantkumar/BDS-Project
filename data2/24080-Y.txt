As an international student, I really need opt extension to help me get H1B visa. On the other hand, to maintain America's leadership in economy, acquiring more talents is urgent and critical! I hope anti immigration organizations think about it seriously. If students go back to China India or other countries, where to find labor to support apple or google?
