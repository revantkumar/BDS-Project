I have been so disappointed that the significance of science and technology is getting disregarded in US. The funding for fundamental research and advanced education is cutting down, and now the OPT extension is considered being cancelled. I can see that in the future there would be full of happy idiots in US. They only care about sports, parties entertainment and money. The society would be slipping back, as elites in science and technology are not encouraged to work in US. Somebody may say that OPT is only for foreigners, and they don't need foreigners to develop the science and technology, but don't forget that US is an immigration country. In some sense, everyone in this country was a foreigner. Moreover, look at the undergraduate education in US, are those US kids well qualified to do top science? Look at the composition of graduate students and postdocs, they are mostly foreigners. if the government does not encourage these foreigners
who have expertise in science and technology to work in US, then I can see that US will quickly lose its dominating advantage in science and technology, and will fall behind some quickly developing countries within a few decades.
