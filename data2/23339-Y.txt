Since the beginning of this country, immigrants,well-educated immigrants especially, has been one of the most important reasons that United stated led, is leading and will lead scientific and engineering research. Let us not forget Albert Einstein, Julius Robert Oppenheimer and many more scientists are not originally American. The openness and acceptance to foreign scientist is the reason why not Harvard is the the best University in the world, not University of Gttingen as it once was. Shutting down OPT extension for STEM student is only keeping the most elite and well-educated immigrants from this soil, keeping them from contributing to this country, and denying Einstein and Oppenheimer to emerge in U.S.A.
