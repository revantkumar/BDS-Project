I strongly support the extension of OPT. 
Firstly, it benefits both US company and international students. Companies could enjoy hard-working employee, who has received US education. Students can earn experience during working. If OPT lasts for a short time, companies might refuse to hire someone could only work for a short time, so that they may face either deficit on employee or not enough time for employees training. Students cannot exert their skills to US society.
Secondly, for not extending the OPT, education industry would suffer. No more students would like to pay the tuition fee for the degree without hope for working experience.
Thirdly, government could also benefit on OPT extension. With those hardworking students, corporate may make more profit, and so government could receive more tax.
