The main reason why I'd like to study in U.S. instead of other countries is that it provides training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students here. Honestly, the work experience here is much more important than which degree you gained when we're looking for jobs. And that's why I'm willing to pay for the expansive tuition here exclusive for international students. 

So I strongly support the improving and expanding.
