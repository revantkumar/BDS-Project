Abhishek Varghese, Aon The US has always been top of the technology influencing countries in the whole world. It is called as a country where new technologies came into existence and were deployed in the whole world. Being an international student and from the technology background, studying in the US and learning new things and being a part of its evolution are one of the best dreams that every child wishes to come true. The more time we get, the more time we would be able to learn and contribute back to the United States in its growth as well. It would be a way of saying thank you for allowing us to be a part of your intellectual environment. STEM opt extension would provide us that time frame to learn and complete our responsibility towards the United States society for letting us be a part of it. I being a student out of the university with no corporate experience would get a chance to have something to build up my resume after the end of extended OPT period. The time frame would allow me to work in diverse areas and be ready to work at any part of the world. 
We would be highly thankful if we are provided the opportunity. 

Thanks
Abhishek
