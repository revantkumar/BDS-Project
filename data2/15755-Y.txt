It's indeed a move towards the right direction.

In my company, people can transfer to US freely with L1 visa but people who graduate and accept from within US has to go through the H1b lottery, where odds are most of them has to be kicked out of the country. Many of them will give up on US while some others will work in the oversea office for 1 year and then come back with an L1 visa. Isn't this absurd? 

Nevertheless and 24 months will certainly have better pain relieving effect but the fact that H1b is capped for college grad needs to be fixed.
