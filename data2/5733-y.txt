Vishal Shah I strongly support the STEM extension for F-1 students as it provides a very good practical training experience for them. Doing this at some of the biggest and best companies in the world is an absolute advantage to the student. Also, the companies employing them are benefited from this. It is a win-win for both the student and company, and also the American economy due to the tuition fee that international students pay at school.
