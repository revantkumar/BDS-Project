Anonymous Anonymous I've worked in this field for many years. The H1B program is taken advantage of and the people coming over are also taken advantage of. They work them for 70 hour weeks on a regular basis because if the person complains they run the risk of the company holding their visa retaliating. They pay them a fraction of what they pay a US Citizen. I'm talking about what the person gets, not what the company sponsoring them gets.
About one in ten of them are actually very good at what they do. They usually cannot communicate very well with their teams, leading to productivity losses. As is said in the news, they are used to replace US workers, not supplement them.
The ones coming here save most of the money they make. They don't intend to stay and become americans. They come here and rent a small apartment which they share with others. They spend very little of their money here because they stash it away to return to their native country after a few years of working here. There, they can retire at 35.
This leads to a loss for the communities they work in. A US Citizen would be buying houses and spending their income. These H1Bs are saving it all up so that they can take it with them back home and retire early.
The H1B program is despicable and the only thing it does is provide a means for foreign workers to earn an early retirement and US companies to get slave labor which they can pay less and work long hours without fear of complaint or lawsuits.
