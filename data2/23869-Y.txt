I support this rule. This is extension shows the sign that America is willing and hoping to keep the high-tech people, who is educated in the U.S., staying the country. The companies will get to have more diverse and skilled workers to choose. The U.S. education system will get better "return values" since more international students will get chance to find job and the resources university/college spent on them will indeed be transformed into the skills serving it's own country.
