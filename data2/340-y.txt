Lisa Yu I strongly support this proposal. I understand this proposal create panic among some US citizens. But I want to comment on some opinions they might have and prove that such panic is totally unnecessary. 

Point: "The OPT program runs contrary to the purpose of non-immigrant student visas"
My comment: OPT program, even with extension, has clearly defined the maximum amount of valid time period. OPT will become invalid if the students are unemployed for a certain amount of time. 

Point: "The new protections for American workers are useless."
My comment: OPT extension program requires students to work for employer who is e-verified, which ensure that all employees are treated equally and no discrimination should happens during the hiring process. This guarantees no discrimination exist between international employees and American employees. 

Point: "The proposed rule creates national security issues."
My comment: Having OPT and OPT extension program is meant to attract talents from other countries. OPT Extension is only issued to students who graduate from universities and studied STEM related fields. These students are usually among the top of their generation from their home country. It's unlikely that they will cause security issues for the US.
