Amy Chang I think this rule is a great proposal because it does not only bring benefits to F1 students but also help F1 students make more efforts to American society. This proposal does not mean that DHS is providing working opportunities to illegals. Most of the STEM F1 students are hard working ones and they always try their best to do their jobs during the optional practical training period and they really can make profits for their companies. I hope this proposal can be passed and I also wish Americans to witness the benefits which this proposal will bring to America.
