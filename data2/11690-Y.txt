I would like to add my support to the proposed improvement and expansion of the OPT opportunities for eligible F-1 international students with STEM degrees. The proposed extension of the OPT period to 24-months is a positive change and should be welcomed by all.

I believe the benefits of issuing an extended OPT period for eligible F-1 students in the STEM fields are manifolds. I will try to enlist the most pertinent ones here:
1. According to a recent USnews article, based on Pew Research Center surveys, there is a severe shortage of qualified STEM professional in the US of A. For example, the article states that there are 3 vacancies for every qualified unemployed worker in the IT sector. Link follows...http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real. The OPT extension helps overcome this shortage in the short horizon.
2. Most international students come to U.S. universities to learn advanced skills, of which on-the-job experience is an essential part. If the students are not allowed required time (3 years of OPT) to learn these skill, there is no incentive for them to study in the U.S.A. The universities in U.S. and the STEM employers would be much poorer without the input of these international students.
3. The proposed extension of the OPT is only applicable to well-qualified international students with STEM degrees. It is not related to immigration. The rule only allows students to learn on the job in U.S. for an extended period (36 months). It DOES NOT aid immigration of foreign nationals.
