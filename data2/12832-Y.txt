I strongely support this rule for the following reasons:

Many international students in stem field will choose to go back their motherland after OPT finishes, so OPT extension will not influence on US citizens to find a job. Many international students just want to accumulate some working experience in American companies, one year working experience is not enough, and three years working experience is good length. So when they look for a job in their countries, they can compete better with others in their motherland. 

OPT extension attract many stem field International students to study in America because above reason.International students will bring a lot of tuition fee to America every year. Besides, they will bring other income such as tourism, shopping and eating and so on, and this can benefit local economy directly and indirectly. However, if this rule can not be approved, they may not select to study in America in the future, America may lose this revenue in the future.
