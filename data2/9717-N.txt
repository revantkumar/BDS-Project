The most important role of the Federal Government is to protect its citizens and taxpayers from attacks and other negative influences on American citizens. I got all my 3 advanced degrees by working part time and summer in large companies which paid for tuitiion for BA, MS, and Ph.D. degrees. Those jobs are gone replaced by the millions of illegals and student visas allowing foreigners to take them and agree to work cheaper. And I have watched big defense and other contractors hire foreign Ph.D. students instead of actual citizen students again because they could pay them less. 

Protecting American jobs should be our priority!! Do You job!

Furtehr The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
