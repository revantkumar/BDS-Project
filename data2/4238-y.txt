Prachi Kulkarni I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. It is essential to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S. as this in turn will drive further development of the U.S. economy.
