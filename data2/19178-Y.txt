It is so encouraging to see the proposal of OPT extension. This provides the US companies the opportunity to search for qualified employees in a larger pool. They can find the best candidates for their vacancies among all qualified graduates from US universities instead of only citizens. This is definitely beneficial for US companies to keep the leadership to their competitors. Therefore, I strongly support this proposal.
