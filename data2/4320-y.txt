Anonymous (An American) What about the homeless and barely making CiTIZENS of AMERICA who try to have successful jobs? How is it that we are prone to allow persons not even from this country come in and take what little we have left to make am honest living for our families? Even though congress may pass this law anyways, regardless of what we think as AMERICANS; we should have the right to be first in this decision not last , that's if congress even consider they own citizens.
