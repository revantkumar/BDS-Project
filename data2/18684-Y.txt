U.S is always an immigrant countries and extend the training opportunities for F-1 
Nonimmigrant students with degree related to STEM will definitely help U.S economic growth. It is quite stupid to provide high and advance education for those foreigner then send them back to their own country to help their own country compete with U.S. 

At the same time, expanding opt duration will also lower current pressure of H1-b working visa. Every year the government only offer very few amount of working visa compared with foreigner who get jobs in those high-tech area. 

And please do not blame foreigners take your jobs off, they are helping with create more profit and then more working opportunity for native. They are doing the hardest work for you but earn almost same amount of salary as you do. Without immigration during mid of 20th century, the U.S will not be as prosperous as current.
