The U.S. is DEAD BROKE, Trillions of dollars in debt. I do not believe or agree that we should be increasing/improving/expanding any training opportunities of F-1 Non-immigrant (or immigrant) student with STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for all Eligible or ineligible F-1Students. Use this money to reduce the government's DEBT.
