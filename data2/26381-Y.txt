I strongly advocate that the new 24-month OPT extension should be put into practice.

I work as a Software Engineer for one of the biggest technology companies in the States. From my experience, almost three quarters of my colleagues came with a non-immigrant background and They. Are. Brilliant.Just as brilliant as US citizens.However, not all US citizens would choose programming over other interesting majors - Arts, investment banking, counselling, politics, etc. As a result, there is still considerable deficiency in talents in US's technology industry given its growing drastically.

Technology boosts US economy - it is and will always be her core competency globally. I can totally imagine how much negative impact it would bring if the OPT extension was cancelled. I firmly believe voiding OPT extension would discourage potential computer genius, technology talents, mathematical enthusiasts from ever entering into US for education, let alone the technology industry.If we knew in advance we could only stay one more year after we graduate, why would we bother spending costly tuition and living costs and going abroad? Extending it, however, will work the other way around. More and more smart people will be attracted to dedicate themselves and to compete in America's technology arena.

Some people consider the extension is equal to bringing more foreign immigrants into US. It is, in a way, but in a good way. And I know lot of people who plan to go back to their own country after working in the States for three or four years. In either case, this would give US economy and technology more ground to land and absorb the freshest "blood" and energy.

I also don't think students in STEM majors can actually exploit US citizens' employment opportunities. The job demand in the technology market is always higher than the supply, and STEMers are just pushing it to equilibrium, which is the perfect state.
