I do think this regulation should be admitted. I'm a OPt student who works for a law firm at NYC, not only myself get the chance to increase the firm's profit though my work but also did a lot contribution to solve the social problems though my pro bono work. Indo think the extension will not harm the employment situation of American citizen, since the chance to work here is not easy to find for those international students, only those job which do get benefit from international students would be offered to international students, that is the economic reason, employers are not stupid.
