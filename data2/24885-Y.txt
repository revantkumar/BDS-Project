I strongly agree with the new rule. Even if there are a lot of negative comments about it. Government should consider the plight of student who take so much of pain to get quality of education and get to experience the industry oriented knowledge through the OPT. This will be a great set back for everyone including the companies as well, as there is already a shortage of Highly educated workforce. Cutting down the training period will also be a setback to economy as students from abroad will consider other countries over US for studies and the billion dollar education sector will face job cuts as well. Hence I request government to consider this proposal.
