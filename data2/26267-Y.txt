I'm a owner of a circuit design company. I have something to say about the OPT. 
1. The policy is really helping my company make progress in business. There are about 10 employees with OPT visa in my company. They are smart and reliable. Work distributed to them could be nicely done without any delay. This could help me focus on the management of the company and make good progress. 
2. I don't think there is job competition between the foreign students and citizens. I personally want to hire citizens. There would be less paper work to do. But I could not find proper citizens with high level education and good at circuit design, even I could not receive resumes from citizens. Thanks to the OPT policy, not only it helps students earn working experience but it really give companies like mine wide resource to choose proper employees. 
3. 29 months are too short. It usually takes 1 year to finish one project in my company. After two projects finished, if without H1b visa, the students with OPT have to go back to their country. What a pity! With two years experience, they are hard cores and treasure of my company. Because of the 29 months time limitation, I have to give up them and re-hire new entry-level employees. I wouldn't say 12+24 months in the new policy is long enough, but it gives more changes(3 times H1B lottery chances) for me to save my treasure. 
I strongly agree with the new OPT policy.
