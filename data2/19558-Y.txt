I strongly agree this new 24-month OPT-extension policy.
First of all, US itself is a multicultural country, very few of the citizens nowadays are "native Americans", while most of them are from different countries. This kind of variety and open environment has played an important role in the fast development of the US. US should say welcome to these new generation of immigrants who wish to contribute their own effort to the development of US!
As we all know, nowadays it's a long time process for foreigners to get the work visa after graduation, and the international students obviously need to keep their legal status during this time (the government of course don't want to force them to be illegal). International students wish to come to America to study because they think the US has more advanced technology and thoughts. How could US just close the door to some students eagerly to learn more and leave better lives? People from all over the world should have the FREEDOM and OPPORTUNITY to choose to leave and work in the place they want to be! 
I saw some comments said that international employees cause some local workers to lose/change their job. I want to say that companies are not stupid, of course they want to hire people who are more CAPABLE for the work. It's just kind of benign competition which allows fairer distribution of labor and capital. Hiring more talented and HARD WORKING employees in the essential fields (STEM) will surely help a lot on the GDP growing. What's more, some foreign employees do the difficult and low paid work that no Americans want to do.
In addition, I believe that the open of the job market to the foreign students will also increase the education industry in the US.
