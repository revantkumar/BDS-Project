J M I think most international students who came to America to study are smart or hardworking. They can do a lot for a company. They can earn a lot of money for the company. And universities earned a lot of money from international students. Everybody knows that.
What's more, there are so many people from all over the world in America. Maybe every American has one or two or even more friends from other countries.
