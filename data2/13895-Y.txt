I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. The IT industry strongly support the economy of America, which require a lot horsepower from STEM major. US citizen do not have enough high quality STEM student to match the high demanding. Therefore, many internet or IT companies hire a lot internationl STEM major students. Without this STEM extension, almost all the large IT company will slow down the growth because of lacking horsepower.
