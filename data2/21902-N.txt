It's my understand Obama and the Obama administration are US voted. To protect, care for, provide for the AMERICAN PEOPLE. Follow the Oath taken to be President of the US.
What is this nonsense. Making sure the US is global education? AT the expense of the American People? To make matter worse, 

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

The Presidents JOB is to provide for the American People. Not foreign countries.
Not to Steal jobs, education and funds from the very people who work to create this country. 

Rejecting jobs to Americans? What is this? Doesn't it sound odd that an American company rejects American's Jobs? Sure sounds wrong to me. Who is the Administration working for? The American people or Foreign entities?
