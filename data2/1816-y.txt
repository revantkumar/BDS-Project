Chao Liu Science and technology should not have the boundary of different countries. Since these students have studied in America and have gained the STEM degree, we should give them the opportunity to practice their skill and create the value for our society.
One of my neighbors is a Asian student studying computer science in the nearby university. He is very kind and nice. Whenever I met the technical problem about computer, he will always lend his hand to help me. And he also helps his school to develop the library management system, which is very useful. I do think that students like him deserve the training opportunities in America.
