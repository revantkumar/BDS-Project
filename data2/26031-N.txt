To Whom it may concern:

I work in the tech industry and would like a detailed explanation as to why foreign national students/tech workers are being given "special consideration" for education/employment as a result of these regulatory changes.

We as a nation are going through one of the worst unemployment crisis in our history, and infusing more foreign workers and denying american citizens the opportunity for these better paying jobs is unconscionable.

This DHS plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, and also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. Since when doesn't the nation need additional tax revenue when we are running an $18T debt?

According to a 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, they found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.

In addition, companies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse H-1B visas and OPT to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas.

Passage of this regulation is NOT in the best interest of the United States economy, our young men and women in desperate need of employment or the future of our great nation.

We, as a nation have the right to direct and honest answers as to why these regulations are being considered.

Sincerely,

Robert Ricard
