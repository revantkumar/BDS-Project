Meng Li I strongly support for the OPT extension. I'm an international computer science master student from China. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity.
As we all know, companies always spend lots of hours training fresh graduates. if the OPT extends to 36 months, I would gain more work experience, so that I could make more value to the company, it benefits to both the U.S. companies and the international STEM students. So OPT extension is very attractive for international STEM talents.
Moreover, the domestic citizens really gain a lot benefit from International students, for instance, most of international students prefer to rent house around the campus, and they also spend lots of money on shopping and vacation. If the OPT extension passes, there will be more STEM students come to study in this country, and they will really promote the economy around the campus.
