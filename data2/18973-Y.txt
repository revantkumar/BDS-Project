To whomever it may concern:
I strongly agree with the 24 months OPT extension for STEM F1 students. The main reason that I concern about is the economy of the U.S. and the win-win situation for both U.S. government and those international students in STEM fields. 
First, the 24 months OPT extension for STEM F1 students can appeal more international students. According to U.S. news, U.S. enrolled a record- breaking number of international students during the 2013-2014 school year, and the number of new undergraduate and graduates students is 886,052. The overall number of international students in the U.S. has grown 72 percent since 2000. Students from China, India and South Korea represent about half of all international students in the U.S. Much of the increase in international students in the U.S. during 2013-2014 was fueled by undergraduate students from China. The number of Chinese students increased to 31 percent of all international students in the U.S. As an international student from China, I want to go to the U.S. for school because I think the technologies in the science field is better than China. Also, I want to stay longer in the U.S. to learn more about the technologies in industries and international business opportunities. I think many international students would have the same thought as me. Thus, the opportunities for us to be allowed to work at the U.S. is very important when we decide to come to universities or colleges in the U.S. I believe if there is no OPT extension, the number of international students will decrease at least 30% of the total. If so, the decreased number of international students would be at least 265,815 each year. 
Let us look at the economic loss if there is 265,815 less international students each year in the U.S. First, the tuition for universities, if 70% of those students go to a 4-year undergraduate school (90,000 in total for 4 years) and 30% of them go to graduate school (40,000 in total for 2 years), tuition loss
