Qian Ma I would love to see that this STEM OPT extension policy to also apply to students with STEM degree but now using OPT from another degree like MBA. A lot of the science and mathematics knowledge are heavily used in our current work, even though it is classified as STEM OPT. Please consider extend the coverage of this policy because the knowledge we got from STEM education are valuable to our employers.
