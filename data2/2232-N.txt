At a time when America is facing low unemoyment of our very own citizens, we should not be showing preference for foreign students. Social security is on the verge of insolvency & we need more $$ going into the system not less. At a te of much national security concern & already not knowing "who" is already here on our country, I feel that we should stop ALL foreigners from coming into a country , legal & illegal, for at least 10 yrs. 
We need to take care of our own citizens first , make assessments on economy& security, then talk about our immigration system .... , secure our borders. ...then Decide what's best for our country.
