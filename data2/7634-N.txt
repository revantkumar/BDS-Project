Why is happening without the pwrmission of congress. And without the knowledge of the American tax payers? Because it's shady. Once again a few line their pockets at the cost of millions of American workers & tax payers. A revolution is going to happen sooner or later with this crooked administration constantly screwing the American workers. There will be NO martial law. There will be war. People have had enough of giving away their hard earned money to foreigners. The jobs in this country MUST be available to the American workers. And that decision must be made in their behalf. Enough of this behind our back deals. Under the table hand shakes. AMERICAN WORKERS MUST COME FIRST.
