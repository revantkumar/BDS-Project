I believe it is necessary. As I see from my university which is a big public one that has over 20000 students, a small portion of them major in STEM. Among this small portion, 20%-30% are foreign students, which makes american student major in STEM even less. 

Regarding to the field such as computer science, a lot of workers are needed to fulfill needs of rapid development of Internet economy. From the long run, what if many companies need more workers when they found there are not enough available. USA is an immigration country where all sorts of culture are mixed. Absorbing excellent resources, i.e. people that has expertise, is one of the most attractions that America has. 

By extending the opt period, more things will be learned in a timely manner. If some people do not have ability, 24 months will make company train them better. If not, they have to leave because there is no way they can make a living. For these people who are more capable, more time makes them more capable. For the worst situation, the company train a person, but after a certain period, he or she become very capable, but due to this regulation ,he or she has to leave. This will result in the loss of excellent human resources. 

So I think the development of this great nation need different people from different field continuously, Not only us citizens but also people around the world.
