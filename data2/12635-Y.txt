I support the decision of increasing F1 OPT extension period to 24 Months from the current 17 Months period. The practical training gained by the student during OPT period helps in building their career as well as important for social and economic growth of the country. Students come to US for higher studies because the course work and the practical training here is very advanced. It is imperative that students should get more practical training and use the practical application of the education received by them for the better future of the students and for the country as well.
