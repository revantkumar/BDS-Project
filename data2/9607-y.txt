Kelly Ren I fully support the 24 month STEM OPT extension because it's at the interest of the United States to keep talented young people in the country to contribute to the U.S. economy. If someone is not able to get a job in the U.S., it's fine that they leave the country. But if someone can get a job in the U.S., the system should allow that person to stay and work in the U.S., and add value to the society. If STEM students go back to their home country, they can use what they learned in the excellent U.S. education system to help their home country. It's great for their home country, but not good for the U.S. America will lose competitive advantage if smart student have to leave because of visa constraints and work for other countries.
