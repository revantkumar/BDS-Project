It is hard enough for us to get regular job and with you giving away the tech jobs you are making it impossible for those who are interested and going to see school supposed by your own words so they can get good jobs. You are making it impossible for those to pay back their loans or get jobs at all. So please stop giving away the jobs we are working so hard to get, to those who are not deserving them. There are enough of Americans homeless and starving. If you want to give those people jobs and government help give up a good portion of your incomes to them. I am not being heartless, I am being a loving caring mom grandma and American. Take care of our Americans and families first also protect them
