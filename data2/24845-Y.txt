I fully support OPT STEM extension

OPT extension plays an important role in the success of our country. We are confident that we are providing the best education to the best of the students all around the world. It makes no sense that we just let these talents back to their own country without contributing to US using the knowledge they have acquired during their studies. Some people hold the narrow views that international students are seizing the job opportunities of US native workers. Most of international students who need OPT STEM receive the highest education in the US and they area seeking job opportunities like engineers and scientists. From the research result, we do not have enough engineers and scientists in our country. Other countries like China, India and Brazil, have tried their best to attract talent but we, the most innovative country, are trying to push these talents away?

For more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed immigrants and refugees from around the world into our nation, enhancing our diversity, culture, and economy. Today, many individuals contributing to the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are immigrants or refugees, and research indicates that skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans.
