China already has the strongest secondary industry in the world and the greatest advantage the US has over China is high-tech and finance. Just think about how many of the software engineers working in the silicon valley are from China. How many of them would go back to China with all the great work experience and exposure and understanding to western culture if the United States take away their OPT. American citizens make the US a great nation and don't forget how many of them are immigrants that devote their wisdom, knowledge, and hard work to establish this great nation.
