I strongly support the rule which is beneficial to the US economy, especially the technology industry. 
Some commenters mentioned the unemployment rate and the thousands of citizens who dont hold a job. With all due respect to individual choices, tech companies are not charity groups. They have no obligation to employ citizens who are not capable/eligible to specific positions. International Stem students are not stealing job opportunities from citizens, they are doing the jobs not ENOUGH citizens can fill in.
