Amod Athavale I came to the US to get a Masters and a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences in August 2008. I completed my degrees in January 2015. OPT has given me the opportunity to apply my education in a practical setting. The STEM extension will allow me to gain more essential practical experience. I am glad that the updated rule will ensure that American workers are not affected by the STEM OPT extension program - this is how it should be.

Also, considering how much the USA has give me (in the form of education), I feel a sense of pride and honor in 'giving back' in the form of the work I do for companies in this country.
