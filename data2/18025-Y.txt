As a new foreign graduate student with STEM major, it's an exciting news if the extension could be valid, not mention about increasing to 24 months. I have friends who got a job with a lot of efforts, and enjoyed working and making their own contributions to the industry. However, some of them don't have the luck to get H1B visa and their OPT was expired. They leaved the country sadly, at the same time US lose these precious intelligents.
I believe with the new rules become legitimate, more and more students are willing to come to US to study and work. Next Steve Jobs could be one of them, leading US to change the world second time.
