I strongly support this proposal to extend OPT STEM period. It's getting more and more difficult for F-1 students to get selected in H1B lottery. Some have to go back to home country because of the expiration of legal status in US. If they can be relieved a little from this pressure, they would focus on their work and contribute more to US society.
