April McCurry HI, I am very opposed to this - as a mom of a newly graduated high tech daughter, and as a high tech worker. There is no need, there is no shortage or wages would be going up not down. Sad that the majority of comments in favor of this are being made by foreign students. Its a sad state of affairs when our government, paid for by our tax dollars for years, takes the interests of foreign students over US citizens.
