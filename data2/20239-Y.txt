Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to support the Proposed Rule on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

First, we cannot take the risk of losing so many potential employees with strong technical background. When I was pursuing my Master's Degree in Stony Brook University, the majority of STEM degree were foreign students. In Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, the foreign student percentage is more than 90%, and a lot of them got a better grade than native students. It also helps create a competitive environment while many of our native students tends to be less hard-working. 

Second, I disagree with several opposite opinions. For example, foreign students make native students harder to find a job. At least, as far as I know, the average time for a foreign STEM student to find a job is more than twice the time for a native student with the same technical level. And another concern about reducing salary, out resourcing consultants are the major reason of reducing salary instead of F-1 Nonimmigrant Students. Currently I am working in Technology Division of Goldman Sachs. Our employees have a great diversity, most from native American or Immigrants. But to reduce the cost, when we raise a new project, we recruit consultants with less salary and a short term contract, most from Indian Consultant Companies.

I really appreciate the opportunity to comment. 

Thanks and Regards,
Trey
