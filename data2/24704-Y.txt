I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. I will help the society grow more health and balanced.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many big internet companies, like Google, Facebook, Uber etc, they need international students to expand their international market because of different culture and traditions all over the world.
