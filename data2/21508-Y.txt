I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who have gained knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and give them more opportunities to make contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for America's present and future.

3. Competition does exist, but it is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, healthy competition promotes innovation and advancement, and in turn it brings about more working opportunities in the society.
