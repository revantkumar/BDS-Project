The greed of American tech companies is destroying STEM opportunities and aspirations for American students. I am steering my young son away from a degree in engineering, which he is greatly interested in, because I see the writing on the wall and the mistreatment of job-seeing Americans. Why should he rack up tens of thousands of dollars in student debt for an intensive 5-yr. STEM degree only to not find work as an American or to get a job where the wages are stagnant because the pool of potential employees is artificially enlarged? You wonder why Americans are leaning away from STEM careers? This was likely the hoped for result by the likes of hi-tech company CEOs who love their lowly paid immigrants. And whether it's against the law or not, don't ever believe it's not happening. There's too much proof it is, and Americans are not as naive and clueless as Congress treats them. It's a pathetic state of affairs when our own country passes over us to hire foreigners. It's always all about the money. The top dogs have their riches and don't care what happens to hard-working middle class America. The American dream is now a nightmare.
