Good Morning,

My Girlfriend is currently on OPT extension after not getting the H1B visa lottery the first time. She very dedicated to her work, her career and has become a valuable employee after working only a short time with her employer. With the current extension she will only be able to apply for the lottery one more time. If this proposed extension amendment lets her and other people in her position apply for a visa a third time it would have a positive effect, I think the fact that these individuals are so persistent and also still employed at their job means that the United States would be retaining the hardest working and brightest individuals by implementing this change. People who are not committed to working hard and having a positive effect on this country will have already returned to their country after the first lottery. By Extending the OPT we will retain a higher caliber a foreign workers. 

Thank you
