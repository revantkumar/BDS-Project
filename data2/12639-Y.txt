I support this rule as the students will be able apply the knowledge attained from our institutes and benefit organizations.
The F-1 students are trained in the organizations to work towards acquiring project knowledge and expertise, which they can apply to benefit the organizations. It will be a loss for the organization if we loose a trained member and start the hunt for new member and train them again to achieve the same level of knowledge and expertise. Everyone deserves an opportunity to work regardless of their nationality. 
This may also dampen the spirits of students who may be planning to come and attain education in esteemed educational institutes in US.
