Please Stop OPT.
This is America and we have always let others come in.
But don't treat them better than us.
Don't change the rulers for them.
It has always been whoever came to America went by our rules and if they wanted to stay a took the tests to become a legalized citizen.
We have already given in to much already.
If they want to change things then stay in their home land and change it there.
