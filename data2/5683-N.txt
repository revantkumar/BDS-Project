I would like to know why our government si allowing preferential treatment to foreign workers when 430000 american citizens are unemployed in the same sector of work,my own daughter has earned a masters degree after 10 years of working part time to put herself through college to get a good job and has yet to find one while companys are hiring foreigners who dont contribute to social security,fica and other programs we have to pay into.I see no gain for our country in increasing the time they are allowed to work here and keep our people on the unemployment line.
