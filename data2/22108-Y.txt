This is a great news for me. I am extremely excited to see this proposal. I am now an international student holding F1 visa and working for a Japanese automotive supplier under OPT. I really appreciate this great opportunity so that I could gain a lot of valuable working experience, which is highly beneficial for my future career no matter in which country. However, 1-year of OPT may not be long enough for a newly graduate student, especially for STEM students because we need more time to learn the whole industry. One year could only make you familiar with the industry, but could not make you step to a higher level. With extension which is 24 months, I believe I would fully develop skills required in this industry and become much more competitive and competent for my future employer. After all, the employer would always be more willing to spend time on a young guy who could work for it for three years, rather than only one year.
