I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Those people who got their master, even PHD degrees in American education system, has been proved to be the group of elite. There is no reason for government like US to refuse those group of people's contribution to this country. 

2. The students here also helped and contributed to US economy, brought a lot of new jobs. OPT as part of the American education system attracted people to study in this country too. For the past few years we can see it worked pretty well, which proved the advantage of OPT-extension.
