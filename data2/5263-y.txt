Han Wong I am in fully support of OPT extension for three major reasons.

First of all, these students are talented and committed to supporting the United States as a leader in technology and science fields. These students are in their 20s, and it's their prime time of creativity and passion. They are devoted to working with the best talents in the US, creating breakthrough in technology and science, and making our life smarter and better. If you open any issue of Nature, Science, or other top journals of science, you will find these students in almost every article, if not in all of them. 

Secondly, this regulation will ensure the best talents can stay in the US. The US immigration system is designed to retain the best of the best. OPT extension is not a permanent VISA; it only gives a brief period for the employers to see what the true value of an non-citizen employee. No employers will even try to keep an employee, if they are not great. Therefore, these OPT students just giving the employers more choices, who can potentially keep the best talents in the country. 

Lastly, this OPT and OPT extension regulation is about American Dream. US is famous for its friendly immigration system, where it allows smart, hard-working people to live and thrive. The OPT and OPT extension systems gives an opportunity for students to demonstrate their value; and for employers to retain the best talents for the country.
