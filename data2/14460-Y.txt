I fully support this regulation. It is a very important regulation for both international students and US economy system.

As the rules regulatory analysis states, the F-1 OPT workforce is 0.19% of US work force which should not impact the job opportunity for American nationals at all. International students working on OPT are not permanent workers which means a lot of them will not stay in US for long, thus contributing to US economy without accruing the benefits of long term stay in US.

The OPT period is also a very powerful advertisement for US universities. US attracts the highest number of international students which add to the education industry economy. If there was no (or only 12 months of) temporary work status program for international students, attracting students in these numbers will be very difficult and the education industry will also suffer great deal.

In conclusion, this is a must have rule which not only provides strengthening to US technology sector economy but also helps the education industry flourish for better infrastructure and amenities for all (international and american students) at all levels.
