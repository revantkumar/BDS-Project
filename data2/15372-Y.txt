I am strongly in favor of this proposed rule. 

International students studying in the US pay for expensive tuitions and there's no doubt they deserve a chance to be trained here in the STEM field after graduation.

The STEM rule is only offering an opportunity to international students, which doesn't mean every international student will be secured a job upon graduation. In front of job opportunities, hardworking and competitive individuals are more likely to grab the chance, no matter they are "foreigners" or "natives". It's a matter of FAIR COMPETITION rather than the sort of "foreigners stealing jobs from Americans", this kind of claims are partial and biased, and such discrimination should definitely be disregarded.
