I strongly support this proposal. This extension will help US to keep and attract even more talent from around the world. It would be unwise for the US to force the students back to their home countries after providing them with years of world class training and education. 

On the other hand, this is by no means a threat to jobs for US citizens. Instead, it stimulates more job openings, with all the start-ups and innovations in emerging scientific forefront areas.

This policy would be beneficial to both the US and international students, so it should definitely be put into action.
