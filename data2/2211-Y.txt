AS an International student, the immigration regulation extension is what attract me. This why we choose USA instead of other countries. And we believe USA also need our International students to contribute to its economy. What I have seen is our International students work at tremendously hard works and help US economy to move on. We are doing jobs in big companies, as Google, Amazon and Facebook. We also taking jobs in small business companies and working hardly. I do not mean to take jobs from Americans, instead I want to use what I learnt to real life use. With more working experience, I prefer go back to my China, where has more working chances .
I think this regulation helps us and USA both. I support this OPT extension for F-1 student.
