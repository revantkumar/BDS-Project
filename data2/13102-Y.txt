I agree! Expanding OPT for F1 students with STEM degrees will definitely help US's related industries to appeal more amount of talanted students to serve American companies in short term. And when these students go back to their own country, they will become a bridge between their homecountry and US. They will help the free trade and make the communication easier than before. US offers scholarship to many students to come to American schools, we want them to serve us and help us grow our economy after graducation. It makes no sense to send them back just after graduation and 1 year's OPT may not enough to get experience in US and understand US good enough to become the bridge between two countries.
