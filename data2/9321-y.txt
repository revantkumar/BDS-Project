Ming Xiao I strong SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:
1. This would make the industry more diversified, and thus generating more ideas and motivations.
2. It is not true that company could pay less for foreign students. In fact, we're paid the same amount as citizens.
3. Having more people in the industry could increase the hiring bar, and thus increase the compatibility of US.
