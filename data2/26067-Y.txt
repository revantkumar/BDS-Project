For those who oppose this without any reasoning, please aware that u r american now is because of this country allowed your grand father or grand grand father to stay here in the first place. America can be such a great country is because its openness to talents. You dont just need a simple job. Thats short term. Having the talents to stay, they can create more jobs for you, make this country into a even better place. Human is always a resouce not a burdent. Lack of talents, you will need to pay for it in the long term
