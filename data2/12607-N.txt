I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. How dare you make incentives for U.S. companies to hire foreign students over recent American grads, including my daughters? I've paid my taxes to YOU all my working life and yet you want to favor companies that are trying to get out of paying taxes? How dare you? With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. It's time to stop this madness and start looking out for America's un and underemployed. Until such time that all able-bodied Americans are earning a decent living wage, regulations such as these should not ever be considered.
