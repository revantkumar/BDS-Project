I strongly support the 24 month OPT extension rule.

1. America being the land of immigrants has constantly helped many famous scientists to contribute to the field of science and technology by providing excellent facilities to perform research. In doing so has always benefited its technology and economy. Aspiring international students who pursue Master's and Ph.D in American Universities contribute 50% of the research which take place in the United States.

2. International students overcome many hindrances when compared to citizens (higher tuition fees, less funding for research at universities, tougher to get a job, face visa limitations, work harder for less incentives).

So, I feel it is a good move to extend the OPT period for both U.S as well aspiring non-immigrant students.
