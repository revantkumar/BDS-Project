Hello,

I am one of the many students from a foreign country that have come to the US for higher education. I would like to briefly list my reasons for why an extension to OPT serves good for everyone.

For companies:
- One year is a reasonable time for most people to establish their reputation in a highly competitive environment, and for the companies to judge the individuals. However, without an extension, companies will be forced to apply for H1B or other visas for the individuals at the very beginning of their association, thus affecting the selection procedure, effectively making it high risk for the companies.

For individuals:
- For those who wish to continue working in the US, and are found to be competitive by their employers, only one chance at H1B lottery is a high risk. This may effectively force many individuals to go back to their home country immediately after finishing their degree in the US.

For USA:
- Having invested significant portion of resources in foreign individuals, US would benefit if many of them work in the US for a reasonable time. More often than not, these individuals are highly competitive and are capable of contributing positively to the US.

Thanks for your time,
Nikhil
