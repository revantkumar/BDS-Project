The new rules would benefit the US economy and job market in those major aspects:

1. Science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) are fundamental drivers of the development of human society. Many industries need people with STEM knowledges. With the new 24 month extension, both startup and big players in the market will waste less money on filling open positions, but spend more on creating new positions. Also STEM graduates would help firms to improve their service and product, or open new market that was previously impossible due to shortage of talents, which will eventually leads to creating more job opportunities.

2. By improving the integrity of STEM OPT program, US government can ensure only students with proper degree in a related field of work can apply for extension. This stops companies to use OPT program as way to lower their labor cost. Wage protection for STEM student can also ensure a STEM student doesn't get below market rate, which motivates company to seek real needs.
