I am an international student here in United States. I strongly support this policy.

I checked through some comments, and find that they say we sabotaged their chances for getting jobs is neither logical nor reasonable. First and foremost, the chance of getting a job mainly depend on the ability and skills, rather than immigration status. Additionally, since everyone is paid equally, hiring foreign students does not reduce cost to the company and thus these companies are not biased in hiring more international students. Last but not least, if the international students did not prove themselves by getting a job, they need to go back to their home country and are not permitted here even opt extension scheme is out there, they will not actually benefit from it. This opt extension is to satisfy the need of some industries' hiring goal, and is good for US economy.

Also from the policy itself, it is adding more regulatory details for opt extension approval so untalented will not be able to spoil this opportunity.

In summary, this policy is fair and reasonable, and will not generate the problems some comments mentioned. Again, I support this policy.
