I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason: 1) With more working experience, it's better for foreign students to help develope a stronger connection with U.S., which will definitely bring more profit from their home countries. 2) The work done by international students are helping the economical groth of the U.S. 3) This policy will help the immigration office to better filter the people with abilities.
