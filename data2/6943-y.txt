Norine Trebil Stop bringing in foreigners to do tech jobs. Train Americans to do the jobs. Give the people that are on welfare a chance at a good job rather than a hand out. Keep Americans working in America. The only reason you are doing this is to line the pockets of big business. Train and hire Americans.
