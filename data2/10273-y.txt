Michael Anderson International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed. If intelligent International students with STEM degrees are allow ed to work more, they would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as the technology development.
