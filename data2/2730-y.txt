Zhixing Jin I strongly support the OPT extension for STEM students. There could be a lot of reasons, but a main and simple reason that I personally have experience is: a lot of projects related to STEM fields require more than one year.

Take me as an example. I have graduated as from Computer Science and Engineering, and I am now working as a software engineer at Google Inc. My team started a project that I am currently involved in since February 2014, but it was still at the preliminary stage one year later. Even at this time, the project has not been fully launched. So for the project itself, it already spans more than one year.

In addition, many of us need a certain amount of time to get familiar with the project. For my project, because it is closely related to the current Ads system, which is a huge and complete system that serves millions of Ads for publishers all around world, it took me more than three months to establish a general idea about the system and to start working on the project independently.

Based on the above facts, if there is no OPT extension, the switching of employee every year will lead to a huge waste of all kinds of resources, including money, human time, etc. And thus, it will definitely hurt the whole company, even the whole industry.

Therefore, the OPT extension is not only a petition from foreign students, but also a necessity from the perspective of the country itself.
