The proposal to expand the controversial OPT program to become a "shadow H-1B Visa program" lasting up to six years should be summarily rejected. 

This proposal adversely affects the wages and working conditions of experienced American citizen technical professionals, who are often required to train their younger imported replacement (via either the H-1B Visa program or the OPT extension to the F-1 [student] Visa) as a condition of receiving their meager outplacement benefit.

This Executive Branch proposal also violates the plenary power of Congress to control immigration, as set forth in the U.S. Constitution. 

I'm an experienced American citizen technical professional with a natural science Ph.D. that has been harmed by employer abuse of the H-1B and OPT programs. I have twice testified regarding these harms in the U.S. House of Representatives and twice to the National Academy of Sciences.

I currently involuntarily work in a poorly-paid adjunct professor position at a nearby college. During the spring, 2015 semester, I collected more each month in (meager) unemployment insurance benefits than I earned in salary at this college.
