I don't know why this program should be denied. Our children have the more opportunities to be admitted into an university with high reputation than the foreign ones, in other words we have already got an advantage. As the foreign STEM students struggle more, and they have created many cool things, if we don't provide them with this opportunity, aren't we too mean? Ask yourself, if you were a foreigner, wouldn't you want a job in the US?
