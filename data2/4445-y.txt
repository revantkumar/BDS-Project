Machelle Allman We write today in strong support of the proposed rulemaking Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Foreign Students. Training opportunities are a vital component of educational programs, and the STEM rule as proposed would allow nonimmigrant students to pursue the training needed to be skilled and productive members of the global community. Students at the University of Washington have historically found great success in obtaining valuable training opportunities in an already restrictive authorization environment. Failure to publish the rule would have a devastating impact upon our students and limit their future contributions to the US and the world of scientific inquiry.

In fact, we recommend that the Designated Degree program list be expanded by allowing STEM OPT extensions for major categories based on the two-digit CIP code rather than the full six-digit CIP code. (An example is 14-Engineering.) It seems arbitrary and difficult to explain when one major is granted the STEM extension while a very similar, related field does not.

We also recommend that if the rule is published as a final final rule, that SEVP be tasked with immediately updating SEVIS to accommodate the changes to ensure seamless functionality.
