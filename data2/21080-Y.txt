I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. As an international student, the reason I chose the United States is the rule of OPT - which is a huge attractive reason for me. Not only the cutting-edge technologies U.S. have, but also the combination of OPT program could help us have more practical industry experience. As more technology companies in U.S. are expanding their international market, they will also benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the U.S., as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries, that the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally. 

Therefore, I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. It do have benefits on the U.S. academic sector and U.S. education.
