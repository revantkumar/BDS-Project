The OPT program has a more negative impact on US workers than it brings positives to business. Congress must act if the executive branch does not voluntarily freeze or roll back this quota. Homogenization of pay scales to some shrinking world average only reduces American workers to a substandard income level, since the cost of living here exceeds that of the imported worker's home countries. Bringing more people in lowers both US and foreign workers disposable income, they very thing that drives much of the economy. Support for more foreign works is foolish, short-sighted and ultimately anti-American!
