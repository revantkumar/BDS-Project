I am a STEM F-1 student in chemical engineering. Some people claim in their comments that we are taking the positions of native Americans. I do not know what is the situation in other areas but in chemical engineering, I would say this is not the case because very few companies will support H1B visa. It means if you need the company to sponsor H1B visa in the future, you will not be considered even to be interviewed. Who need H1B visa? The F-1 students in OPT. The truth is it is extremely difficult for STEM F-1 students to find a job. CS major is the only exception. If one F-1 student can find a job, it means no qualified Americans apply for this position. We are not taking the jobs from US citizens as we can only be allowed to work in the field directly related with our major. Waiters, workmen in car collision shop, lorry drivers..... will not be our positions. We are working in the fields that the U.S. needs but not enough U.S. citizens available.
