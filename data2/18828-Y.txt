I believe it is shortsighted to deprive international students' legal right to work in US. Admitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. In long term, it enhances the capability of the working force. Additionally, it is the the working experience that makes US universities more attractive to international students than other countries. It helps US university stay competitive.
