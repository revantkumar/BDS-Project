This makes no sense whatsoever. We have millions of people in this country that can't find a job or don't want to. Why 
would we want to make it more favorable to have non-citizens get jobs. We need to make it easier for our citizens to get 
and keep good jobs. This benefits the big corporations at the expense of the taxpayer. Stop the corporate welfare and the 
pandering to non-citizens. We need to do things for Americans, not foreigners! Besides, Social Security could use the 
money!!!
