I vote a big YES to this OPT extension proposal.

DHS is taking this action to include a STEM OPT extension as part of the OPT program under the F-1 nonimmigrant classification in order to better ensure, among other important national interests, that the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally. Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. The international students who chose to study in the U.S. may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding where to pursue their degree. If the OPT extension was finally disabled, the U.S. academic sectors will lose competitive advantages, and the education institutes will be facing a big loss due to the mistake.
