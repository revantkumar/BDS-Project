The OPT extension will make a positive contribution to the prosperity of the economy of the United States. It is widely known that there are few native new grads on the STEM job market. According to the USnews report, "the STEM Job Market Much Larger Than Previously Reported", (http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2014/02/05/report-stem-job-market-much-larger-than-previously-reported), there is a large and growing demand for STEM trained students. Hence, allowing more OPT students to work in the US will not impact the employment for US STEM students. Fact is that on the STEM job market, there is a major discrimination based on the immigration status, citizen or permanent resident candidates are able to get the job offer way much easier than F1 OPT candidates or H1B candidates.

If the United States fail to attract the worlds best young people to work for the nation, it will likely to be beaten by other growing parties in the world, such as China, Europe, Australia and Brazil, especially China. 

The purpose of this STEM extension is to fulfill the high demand of STEM trained personals. It is very important to the prosperity of the United States in the long run.
