I strong support this rule!!!
And I don't know why some people thought international students take their jobs because we are paid less? Who told them that and which report shows that result??
Actually, international students are very difficult to get a job compared with us citizen.

For example, in the manufacturing industry, lots of companies only look for us person. 

And to some companies, they don't like international students not only they don't know the procedure of hiring a foreigner but also that will cost them more(like, for h1b employee, employers need to explain why didn't hire us person, and there is required salary). 

No matter opt or h1b, we paid the same tax as us citizen, so why some one said the company paid less tax?? Come on! Do some research!

So before saying those wrong information, please do so research!!!
