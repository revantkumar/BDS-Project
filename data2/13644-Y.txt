As an international student with STEM OPT extension I strong believe the proposed rules can benefit US economy as well as foster better international cooperation for the following reasons.

1. US educated students with technical skills can improve productivity and profitability for US companies and benefit the whole US economy in the long run. Comments posted by lobby group with opposite view emphasize international student took jobs away from US citizens. However, their argument overlooks the fact that talent can drive economic growth that ultimately benefit US citizens and social welfare. 

2. STEM OPT majors are traditionally dominated by international students. Studies show more percentage of international student in STEM compared to non-STEM majors.
