As a potential international student, I strongly support this proposal. Actually, although I always want to have the studying abroad experience, I haven't decide which country I would like to go. There are many options, England, Australia, Canada, America, Singapore and so on. The reason I prefer America is that it provides students opportunities to practice what we learned from school during our studying and after we graduate from school. In addition, having three years' working experience in the US would be a big plus for me after I get back to my own country. If there are no such opportunities for international students any more, then America would be less attractive to me. After all, the tuition and life expense in America is almost the most expensive for international students among these countries. I would rather choose a country that is nicer and cheaper to international students to achieve my studying abroad dream.
