I strongly agree with the new proposed rule from ICEB. To keep United States as the strongest country around the world, United States still need the best talents around the world to contribute to the country. However, many countries around the world also know this, and keep improving their immigration policies to attract the best talents around the world. By reducing the difficulties in immigration, many best talents from China or India finally decided to study and work at that country, instead of choosing United States. Currently, although many best talents still choose United States for their studies, it's difficult to keep attracting best talents if they know they only have few chances to stay at here after studying.

To reduce the cost and risks for attracting best talents, the international students with STEM degrees are the best candidates. Since U.S. only need the best talents, the game rule is easy for them. If they could prove they are the best talents, they should have the abilities to find an excellent job. If not, they should leave. In this case, U.S. keep the best talents among the pool and the next step should give them the H1B visa for long-term working permission. 

Some people might believe that those students took some opportunities in the job market. If this is the main concern, I suggest that also add some other policies into the rule. For example, if a student want to expanding their OPT time to 36 months, he/she needs to have the base salary higher than $110,000. In this case, only the best talents could stay in U.S.
