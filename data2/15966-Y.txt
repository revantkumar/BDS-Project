I strongly SUPPORT this rule. For the STEM subjects, most of the students in university are foreign students. And many US tech company cannot find enough US students to support their growing. They have to find foreign students. The tech companies effects many many other traditional industries. If the F1 student can stay and support the tech company, finally many many jobs will be created for other industries. 
It will benefit all of the US citizen. 
Let's approve this rule!!!!
