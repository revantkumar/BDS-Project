I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:
1. Study and training should be combined, especially for STEM. Students in STEM who learn advanced technology and knowledge are willing to have training after they finish their degree and contribute; otherwise, if they go back to their countries right after they graduate, the advanced knowledge could not be used efficiently and could be even wasted.
2. Most programs associated with STEM lasts two or more years, without OPT Extension, I believe those programs could not continued, thus harms both American companies and students, I don't see benefits here.
3. Without OPT Extension, STEM will not be as attractive as nowadays, because students cannot get directly training after they graduate, it definitely will influence student's willingness to apply for school in USA.
4. STEM students don't take American's job opportunities away, because companies only hire an international student when there is no American is more eligible for that position. The reason why some American don't have a job is that they are not capable of the position but not international students take the job opportunity from them, with or without STEM students looking for a job opportunity, those who cannot find a job still cannot find a job, international students is the excuse but not reason.
