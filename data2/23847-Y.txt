I mightily support this proposal because not only I would be a direct beneficiary who will be fortunate to lengthen the period of working in such a world's leading technology circumstance if new proposed law passed ultimately, but also it will virtually bring along meritorious feedback. 

Here is my intuitive understanding. Prolonging OPT extension to 24 months will undoubtedly attract more talented students (potential future workforce) from all over the world to come pursuing higher education. After their graduation, there will be plentiful of highly-qualified job seekers swarming into job market, which contributes to employers picking out outstanding employees. On the other hand, it will inevitably produce heavy burden on native graduates. However, no pressure means no motivation to progress. With more and more eminent immigrant and native graduates, it will certainly produce enormous propulsion to all fields covered by STEM and boost American economy recovery.

It is appropriate for me, an IT practitioner, to draw out an IT related instance to demonstrate why it will be practicable. Open-source projects, which allows each brilliant person from anywhere involves in developing and improving, are getting more and more popular recently. And it has also proved itself a success. Google, Yahoo, IBM and so on are all one of world's largest open-source companies, whilst are bellwethers at respective fields. It will be sagacious to carry out this proposal, which resembles open-source project, to maintain American world's leading position in long term. 

In short, I deem it is absolutely one 'Hitting multiple birds with one stone' proposal.
