I married my wife last year and she is Chinese. She is pretty, smart and industrial and I love her deeply. I met her in my company. Without OPT which granted her legal status working in US, I would never have met my wife. She urged me to write some comments about this extension. I would say I fully root for it. Since we should allow more hard-working intellects getting into our country.
