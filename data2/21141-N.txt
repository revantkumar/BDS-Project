Taxpayer funds should go towards the education of US citizens rather than F-1 Nonmigrant students!!! Every position given to an F-1 nonresident student takes away a position from a US citizen. Virtually all programs accept government (taxpayer) funds. Diverting these funds to nonimmigrant students should be illegal. DO NOT extend the length of stay for these individuals.
