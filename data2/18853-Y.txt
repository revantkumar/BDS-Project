I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
Some American citizen think international students took their job, that's untrue.
Companies hire people based on their skills, international students work hard, that's how they get jobs. Also, stem students are just very small part of international students, they are making huge value to the country, that's why the proposal would have way more benefit and it's very reasonable.
The request to place the right of citizens over non-citizens is simply RIDICULOUS. Just remember, every citizen or their ancester once was an immigrant. This law would help the United States get way more talented and high valued people to the country.
