Yaoyuan Liu I strongly support the OPT extension rule, here are my justifications:

1. In many research institute, the STEM-related jobs need longer training time than many other jobs, they need the OPT extension, so that the employers will not lose them due to visa problem, otherwise, those employers will have to pay additional amount of money to hire someone else to continue the job. So the OPT extension helps those employers to save money.

2. The OPT extension will no doubt attract more talented students to study and work in this country, bring more income to many industries and innovations to the U.S.

3. The OPT extension will not affect the job opportunities for domestic people, because there are much more vacancies in STEM-related industry than provided, this will only benefit the related area, like IT, statistics.
