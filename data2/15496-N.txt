Just two points are enough to eliminate this program .
Point One : No legislation should ever exist to give employers incentives to hire Non-Americans over Veterans or Citizens . Americans come first .This program alone takes jobs from almost 500,000 citizens .
Point two: Under no circumstances should money from Social Security be used for anything other than providing benefits to anyone who has paid into the program .
