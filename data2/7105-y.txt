Sunnie McCabe, WJU I strongly support this rule for the following reasons: 1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US and pay for high-level education deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. 2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area. 3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US. 4. The STEM market need qualified employees and cannot be satisfied by only Americans. 5: OPT program provides more chances and time to enhance the diversity of workplace which is beneficial for technology industry improvement and the whole economy.
