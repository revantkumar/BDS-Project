I strongly support this proposal because,

1. That's the reason I'm here in American, find a job and gain some work experience. I have no intention to live in this country for my whole life.
2. It's beneficial for the US government, for the STEM students are the most brilliant students in their country, think about how much profit they can make after graduation!
