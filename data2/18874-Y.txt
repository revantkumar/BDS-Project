I strongly agree to revoke and expand the OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months for both the contributions to American technologies and diversity of culture in Americans.

Nearly 90% percent of the students are working in high tech industries, they are quite clever and smart in innovate new technologies and discoveries in their field, they are making contributions to make American as the leader in high technologies, and make American stronger and leading position in this world. What DHS should pay attention is the companies who hiring OPT and OPT extension students should have the equal rights to get corresponding payment for their hard works. 

As the OPT and OPT extension students are most aliens, they contribution to the local cultures and bring the good things from their own countries to us, a good example is the food, and sweet smiles from these ones.

So I strongly support revoke OPT extensions and expand it to 24 months.
