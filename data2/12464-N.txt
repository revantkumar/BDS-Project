Your expansion of the OPT program is beyond ridiculous. Instead of enticing and rewarding companies for hiring foreigners to come to this country hey aren't you enticing and rewarding them for hiring Americans. It's the American worker who sustains this country by paying taxes and as far as companies go if they don't get enough tax breaks then they should be working with or talking to government about getting these breaks by hiring Americans they should not be so greedy they through them out of the work place to make some extra money. You all should be Asa Ed. You are also putting this country at risk.
