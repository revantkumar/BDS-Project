I strongly support this new rule. 

Im working in an IT company in bay area. Attracting talents all around the world is critical for American companies stay being competitive. Lots of my coworkers are from other countries, some of them are working with OPT (F-1 Optional Practical Training) . They are all talented and workaholic, Im really happy to work with them.

I saw someone commented that STEM students dont need a long training period. That is definitely not true for computer science. Theres a huge gap between lessons learned in University and skills needed in day to day work. In my company, normally it will take 3 to 4 years for a new-graduate to become an well-trained, experienced and solid engineer. Without the extension, an talented international student have to leave after only one year, when he just start getting to know the business knowledge and fundamental tools. Its a waste for both the student and company. For the students, they come to America not only for the academic study, but also (if not more important) for the practical training opportunity. They wont get much from such short period. For the companies, they trained the students and paid salaries, but the students can not do much in the first year. Companies are expecting the students taking more responsibility in the following years, and getting more experience when owning and handling larger work. 

It will be really disappointed to see my coworkers who have great potential leave America, just because this country wont give them the opportunity with larger project and show their talents. I dont want this happen so I strongly support this new rule.
