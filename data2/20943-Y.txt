Extending OPT for foreign students is both a rational and necessary act to maintain the competitiveness of US education and economy in the global stage. Without a reasonably longer period that allows foreign students to work in the country before they choose to go back, talented students may be likely to choose to other countries to study and work. A lot of the examples coming from my friends near me were forced to leave the country after 12 months without finishing their job/research/project, and left unnecessary economic and intellectual loss to both themselves and those firms that are more than happy to offer them a position and invite them to contribute.
