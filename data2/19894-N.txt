I am OPPOSED to the Department of Homeland Securitys proposed rule to expand the program Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign student STEM workers (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) over American citizen STEM workers. The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers, and will destroy the job prospects of recent American citizen STEM graduates.
American citizens STEM job opportunities and wages will be ADVERSLY affected by expanding OPT eligibility for foreign students to three years after graduation. By increasing the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands of foreigners, companies will have financial incentives to bypass American citizen STEM workers. Furthermore, because foreign OPT workers are technically students, employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year per foreign worker for each of the three years they employ OPTs, to the detriment of American citizen STEM workers.
Since I view OPT expansion as a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas, I urge the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) not to allow foreign STEM degree-holders to remain in the country and work on their student visas for up to 3 years after they graduate. There must be fairness for American citizen STEM workers in the STEM job market. Please do not stack the job-hiring deck in favor of foreign STEM workers as opposed to American citizen STEM workers.
