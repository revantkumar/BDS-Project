This is utterly ridiculous! I have 2 S.T.E.M. PhD American citizen children who do not have permanent jobs at this time. But I see there is no additional mentoring, wage protection, etc. offered to them. With all of the wonderful American citizen talent U.S. companies have available to them and the high American unemployment rate why are they being rewarded to hire foreign workers? U.S. companies that hire foreign workers, those who are not American citizens, should be fined instead of given financial incentive.

Stop the gravy train to immigrants, F-1 visa holders and foreign students! AMERICANS need good full time jobs, not part-time (29 hour, thank you Obamacare) service sector jobs that hold no real chance of advancement, raises, and the security of being able to provide for our families. We need to come up with a plan to educate, train and mentor our own unemployed and underemployed student and professional citizens before all others.

Americans first. When we finally have a low 2% unemployment rate then maybe it will be time to try to train and educate some selectively chosen foreign workers so they can take capitalism back to their own countries and help them improve. We do not need them to stay here waiting for more hand outs.
