If anyone is here illegally, they should be deported. Legal immigration is entirely a different matter.

This country has been inundated with unscrupulous businessmen, politicians, and bureaucratic self-servers - all to the detriment of the natural born citizens. As long as there are citizens in need of jobs, there should be no foreigners filling those positions.

Clean up the messes created in the name of greed. Put the "white-color" criminals in prison where they belong (including criminal politicians [Clintons, et al.] and terrorist supporting goons [you know who they are]), instead of sweeping everything under the rug, allowing them to perpetuate their crimes against our country and citizens along with the international community. 

ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THIS COUNTRY, prosecute all choosing to operate outside of our laws.
