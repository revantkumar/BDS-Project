Biswanath Banik STEM extension for F-1 students is what makes United States a great destination for higher education in Science and Technology for international students. This gives an unique opportunity for students to have extended trainings and this also gives employers to get the benefit of having diverse talent. With H1-B being a purely lottery based system, STEM Extension helps retain technical and scientific minds in the US workforce and that in turn will help the economy to grow. Also this helps students to pay off the huge education loans for higher education. Make no mistake, this is a win-win situation. I think by extending STEM OPT duration is by all means beneficial to the economy and also for the international students. I would rather say, if STEM extension is made equivalent to H1-B duration (upto 6 years), then there would be more enrolment in Science and Technology programs from international students. This is only a fair game considering the current rate of enrolment of domestic vs international students in most of the US Universities.
