I strongly support to the proposal to extend the OPT time to 24 months. The reasons are following. 
First, America has the best education institutions in the world and have trained many foreign students in STEM region. Having OPT extension, more students will come to the US and there is higher chance to attract best talents to stay which is very important for the US because the world now driven by creativity. The creativity needs best talents and just imagine if they are not allowed to work in the US. When they go back to their own country, they will start up new companies that will compete with US companies. All these knowledge are leaned from US universities and all the skills are gained in the US companies. 
Second, statistically all the high tech companies are lack of labors. If America doesnt allow them to stay, there is surely not enough people to work and to drive the Americas leading position in the world. 
Also, extending the OPT will have more people come to the US to study. These students needs to eat, buy cars, rent a house, travel around the US, etc. They can bring lots of working opportunities in all kinds of industries. 
I think this rule is more beneficial to the US economy and will strengthen the leading position in the world. I support the pass this rule.
