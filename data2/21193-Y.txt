I don't understand why those comments said Americans loosing their jobs because of the new rule. The government set up the opt extension for STEM because we don't have enough Americans who want to work on those areas. I am a teacher in university teaching computer science and only 2 to 5 students are Americans in my class. We assume that all the Americans got their jobs, we are still lack of people! The government NEVER stop you guys from learning computer science. If you say international students make Americans loose their jobs, PLEASE, Americans, come to school and get the relevant degree, then you can get a job in STEM area. Google won't hire you as a software developer even you are you are U.S. Citizen and in fashion major. We need people who are in STEM area to help our country to get better. Gov needs to spend more on encouraging American students to study STEM degrees, but this is a different case with the OPT extension. 
American, please look further and be open minded.
