As a current STEM-er on OPT, I never consider myself cheap labor. I am NOT hired because I demand less salary than others who do not get the job (I am earning a higher salary than most coworkers with the same title.) I am hired because I am expertise in software developing and I have done brilliantly in job interviews. America, please keep the talents that have proven themselves in job interviews. Thank you.
