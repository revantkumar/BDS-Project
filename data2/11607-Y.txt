As a current F-1 student, I strongly support the proposal with following reasons:
1. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. There are quite a few remarkable people who achieved success were once international students. Also, United States is well known of its diversity and inclusion.

2. Increasing number of international students who want to come to the U.S. for study indicates that U.S. is strong in education and it is willing to share its wisdom. 

3. Competition does exist but it is positive competition. International students gain skills from high level education and target on the opportunities needing specific requirements while U.S. citizens may not have these required skills.This positive competition can help U.S. to select better candidates and improve average competitiveness. It also can increase the global competitiveness of the U.S. with these better candidates, no matter they are citizens or aliens.

4. Fairness for talents need to be enforced. As a matter of fact, the U.S. is also well known of equal opportunity which is also a main reason that more and more talents want to come and stay in the U.S.. This can be enforced by this proposal by giving fair opportunity to international students who have talents. By doing this, the U.S. shows it is indeed a strong country.

5. The government should let the students who learned knowledge and improved themselves from U.S. universities stay in the country in order to make contributions to the U.S. as payback. International students sincerely want to show their gratitude to the U.S. society.
