I do support this bill. Reasons are as follows:

1. The economy of the United States relies on the growth of high-tech, financial and many other companies who require their employees highly educated and equipped with interdisciplinary knowledge. The fact is that many international students with STEM degrees satisfy the requirement. The extension will activate the students to stay and work in America. And this will boom the economy of the United States for sure. Every citizen will benefit from the booming.

2. On the other hand, there will be less chance for these students to get employed if there is only the 1-year OPT for them. International students in American usually are clever. If government doesn't take full advantage of that, what waste of talented person.

3. It is known that America is a country where it gives chance to everyone. International students with talent and specified skills deserve this chance definitely. And also, if there is a longer OPT extension, more talented international students will be attracted to come to America.
