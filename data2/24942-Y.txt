I am a Stem student start working in this July. I strongly support the STEM extension. 

One of the primary reasons I choose my master program over another few programs is that's a stem program, which means I could work for about 2.5 years. Actually when first a proposal against STEM extension initiated, I didn't take that seriously. In short I feel so many companies are hiring these STEM students, if they stop the program, it would be a loss for companies as well. 
I saw many reviews say we are taking the jobs opportunities against Americans. I admit that our existence increase the competition. But after the competition, it is the company, choose to hire who, for a certain position. With a huge disadvantage in language for majority STEM student and an additional cost for sponsor H1B status, if we are still hired for a position, I would say we are really qualified for that position itself. And very possibly company can't find a better alternative within US citizen. 

If we only work here for one year, to be honest, this would be a bad thing for both student and company. In the first year, it's more a learning process, company invest a lot to train new hires, student could only gain limited experience for another job. 

I need to stop, but I want to support STEM extension!!!!
