I DO STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal of the OPT extension.

I am an international student majoring in mathematics from China. Before I came to US, I had multiple choices to purse my phd degree in US, UK, HongKong and Singapore. The most important reason that I chose to study here is because US could provide me the industry training opportunities during school or after graduation. The previous 17-month OPT extension was a significant addition to the 12-month OPT because most large research/ projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those projects would lose their VISA before the project completion, in which case, it would be a huge loss to many US companies and a tremendous impact to US economy. Right now the new 24-month OPT extension would be a better replacement since more and more projects require more time to complete.
