Dear professor,

I respect your opinion, but I have to question your thought on 'inflated GPAs' of foreign nationals! From where came, obtaining a GPA of 3.5 or above is as hard as it is here in the United States. The scholarships or assistant-ships that foreign national receive in US universities is based on multiple factors other than GPA, which include entrance examinations like GMAT, GRE, SAT etc where everybody is tested at equal level, and as you know that america does not discriminate while admitting students and offering assistant-ships. 

Also you say that job market for STEM studentsAdults is slim. As an active job seeker, I see a lot of job opportunities (in STEM category) and I am sure that whomever STEM candidate you know who is looking for job will surely get placed! If there are few who are still looking, it may be because they are not qualified enough! (I have to say that job market is not slim such that only very qualified and intelligent would bag jobs! There are jobs for many talent levels!) Please do correct me if I am wrong!
