Leon Yuan I STRONGLY SUPPORT this rule, here are the reasons:

1. Some argues that Gov takes tax payer's money to support foreigners. However, OPT students are paying exactly the same tax as the citizens. Those funds are also coming from the students like me, who are really happy to see this opportunity to enhance the experience outside of the campus.

2. Besides, OPT students could greatly support the local business and community. They attracts more business to enter the community, bring convenience to the neighborhood. Furthermore, many of them are joining churches and volunteer groups to contribute more. 

3. Employers have to get E-Verify in order to hire OPT students. This forces employers to not discriminate any employee, including citizens. Besides, considering the OPT students percentage of the new graduates, employers, big or small are not preferring one to the other. Without this rule, I could foresee that many employers will face shortage of employees, especially those in professional area, just because they are F-1 student.
