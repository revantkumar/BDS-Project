Vishnu Vardhan Kumar Pajjuri I support this rule.

United States has always been a land of opportunities and I have come this far in hope of fulfilling my dreams in this great country. International Students like me come here hoping to gain world class knowledge and exposure for which we pay hefty amounts of out-state tuition fee.According to U.S.Department of Commerce, International students added $30 billion to the U.S economy in 2014 through their spending.After completing our studies, we want to put the knowledge we learnt into practice by working in your world class companies, gaining real time experience and contributing into building up this country's economy.

If the OPT extension isn't provided, it would be hard for the U.S employers to hire an international students who would have just an year to work for his/her company. Also it would be hard for the international students to get trained, work and gain experience within those 12 months of OPT. So please pass the rule of 24 month OPT extension which would be a win-win scenario for both International students and the U.S.

Thank you.
