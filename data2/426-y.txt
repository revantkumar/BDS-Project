Dehua Cheng I fully support the updated OPT program. It will establish US as the most favorable professional education destination for international student around the world, which will greatly benefit the education providers. Moreover, it provides an positive force in keeping US as the top technology innovator as its current status. I will elaborate in the following paragraphs. 

Firstly, OPT is the core part in professional education, it is without doubt the main reasons that why an international student choose US as oppose to other regions to study. While practice makes perfect, I would put enough in that sentence. Current 12 month OPT limits the utilities for certain disciplines, and STEM are some of those. It usually requires a considerable amount of time for the employees to learn its position and make real contributions to the employers. With 12 month Cap, the international students will look much less appearing to the employees and the luck few of the international students who got employed wont benefit enough from the experience. 

Secondly, the international students serves as a indispensable work force in the field of STEM. Based on my experience, as in some career fairs, the employer in STEM are eager for talents. There are enough cake for every qualified workers. Therefore, many claimed arguments for it to hurt US workers are simply not true.

The last but not least, the OPT period is a choice for both sides. The valuable employee will get a chance to join the US permanently. As an country built by immigrants and their descents, US has the tradition and advantages of attracting skillful workers from all around the world, and working together in the name of the US. 

With all clear benefits, the proposed program should be accepted.
