I strongly support OPT STEM extension.

First, the extension will create more job opportunities for local citizens. Just think about the number of international students come to US for further study. They are also taxpayers and create tons of jobs and opportunities for local citizens. Some claim that the international students would seize job opportunities because they are willing to accept a lower pay. However, students who need OPT STEM are ones who received highest education and seeking job opportunities in engineers and scientists. They are not even in the same job market with local workers.

Second, canceling the extension will lead to an enormous economy loss for US both short termly and in the long run. The cancelation will strongly discourage international students to study in US and will be a great loss for industries like hosing and education. In the long run, international students who receive the best education in US would return to their original country and contribute with all the knowledge learned here to their own country. Is it better to make them build a stronger US or greater India or Russia? 

In summary, Improving and expanding training opportunists for F1 nonimmigrant students is by all means beneficial to US economy and citizens. It should be PASSED.
