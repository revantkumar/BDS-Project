I am saddened and concerned that you would seek to expand OPT at a time when record numbers of Americans have given up trying to find work. In fact, given that this very program was found by one FOIA request to have denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs between 2009-2013, it is no wonder why a majority of Americans think this country is on the wrong track! This program is hugely detrimental to our country as it is causing a brain drain within the native born US worker population, particularily in the info/tech sectors. Since OPTs are saught after by employers because they tend to be younger (and cheaper) than their American counterparts in the workforce, making it easier for US companies to exploit foreigners at the expense of innocent US workers is not an effort the federal government ought to be proud of.
