Brandon Nelson I support the proposed OPT extension rule. I even think higher-degree students deserve even longer term or better change of getting US citizenship.

I work for Google and most people we hire here has Master or Doctorate in STEM, because most positions require skills acquired from higher education. We hire a lot of international students because they qualify for the jobs. But it is a huge loss for the company when they reach the end of their OPT and have to leave due to out of luck for H1B lottery. We have to rehire people and retrain them. Like I said, it is a huge loss for the company.

So why not hire more US citizens since they do not need OPT? We do hire US citizens! We actually are more likely to give offer to US citizens if we can find any. But the problem is that we cannot find enough candidates for the job! Most people in US do not want to take STEM majors any more!

So Americans please do not fight against OPT students taking our jobs for now. Let's worry about our value and education first. Before we can get enough STEM workers from our own country, let's have these OPT students help growing our business.
