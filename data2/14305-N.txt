I am requesting that the OPT program not be expanded due to denying jobs to Americans. 
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. It is time the Federal government put the American people first when it comes to jobs.

Sincerely,
