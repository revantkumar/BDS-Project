As a graduate student, I could see this regulation will benefit US economy a lot for the following reasons. 

1. STEM student helps a lot to driven US economy. A small amount of student will driven a lot. Which won't cause impact able change to the US job market. 

2. As the economy growth, there will be more and more job opportunities in general which will benefit US people a lot.
