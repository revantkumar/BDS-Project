I am an international students study in Syracuse university, I fully support this new opt-extension policy.
First, American is the most powerful country in the world, and the reason it is strong is that it accept nearly lots of elites every year, and most of them are students study in the university within united states. If they have more time stay in the united states, they will employ what they learn from school to build the whole country. For example, a lot of famous start-ups like uber, airbnb, snapchat and many other companies like these and their business become larger and larger with the help of lots international students from school, and these companies provide more job opportunity for local people, and enrich a lot of local people, in the long turn, the crime rate will become lower and lower.
Second, I think the opt-extension will never affect local people's job opportunities, because a lot of companies will more likely to hire citizen if they have the same skill because they will never ask for H1B visa which cost a lot of money, and they will never ask for green card which also cost a lot of money, so I think if local people and citizen have the same skill, most of the company are more likely to hire them.
So, I fully support this new opt policy.
