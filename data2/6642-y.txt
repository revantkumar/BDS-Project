Xiangyu Zhang Americans, I wanna you to be aware that people who take your jobs away are Indians not international students. Look at how many Indians are transported to US every year through thousands of Indian consultancy companies. They come to work not study! 99% of them work in the IT and get high paid. International students serve this country in numerous areas, most of which Americans are reluctant to touch, like chemical,biological,electrical.This country will collapse without these international elites!
