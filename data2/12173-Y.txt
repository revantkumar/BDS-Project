I stand up for this proposal since it not only concerns international student's personal interests, but also refers to United States economic growth.

The greatest advancements in society from medicine to mechanics have come from the minds of those interested in or studied in the areas of STEM. Once the proposal of extension by 24 months for OPT is proved, It will become a great incentive for attracting overseas STEM talent. In that case we are actually helping Americans remain completive through promoting academic exchange, innovation and collaboration. 

Also, It is well accepted that the STEM workforce has an outsized impact on a nations competitiveness, economic growth, and overall standard of living. It's worth mentioning that U.S is actually suffering from the shortage of skilled STEM professionals according to Bureau of labor Statistics as well as U.S news. Growing STEM workforce that is central to economic vitality. 

As F-1 students with STEM degrees, we are doing what we can to help the economic growth. It will be such one-sided and prejudiced to oppose this proposal by only holding the view that we are taking away citizens jobs.
