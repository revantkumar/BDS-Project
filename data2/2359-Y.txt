I strongly support this proposal!. The OPT has been the reason why the US is the first choice for foreign talented people seeking to further their skills and contribute to the Tech industry. The new rule will also help a lot of international students to explore new horizons in life and provide them ample time to get trained and compete in the field of interest they wish to. People with longer STEM extension are able to spend more time advancing their professional skills and contributing to the country. It is beneficial for the US IT Industry as well, as they are able to hire strong talent people around the world and let them stay in states help building their business.
