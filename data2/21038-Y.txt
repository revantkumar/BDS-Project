I am a restaurant owner at Palo Alto and a large number of my customers are foreigners, either college students at Stanford or employees working in nearby companies. I will welcome such a policy to get more students and employees to our country, at least it can increase our income. 
Anyway I do not think they will compete with us citizens for jobs. They do not come for the low-tech positions in US. As for the high-tech jobs, which country will bother with having too many smart guys?
