Leyi YIn I support this proposal since it's unjust to deprive international students' right to work in America after graduation. Most STEW degrees graduates are top students majoring in CS, finance and mechanical fields which are core power of American technical innovation and economy growth. As international students, they spend a great amount of money to study in America, which contributes to American economy, and they are willing to use the knowledge they obtain here to work for America while earn less and contribute more, isn't that great?
