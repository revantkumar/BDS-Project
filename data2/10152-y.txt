Anonymous Anonymous I strongly support the extension. 

This is because I feel like an issue is that international students come here and stay back but that is not true in most cases. They might work for a while but most of them eventually return back to their home countries. Also, in the STEM field, the ratio of international students to American citizens is very high and if the rule goes through, educational institutions will go into a loss and the lack of many stem students in the field of STEM research will reduce which will hinder the educational value of STEM. It will also lower the economy of the country by a large value because in the future, the number of international students that would want to come study in USA will reduce drastically. This means that there will be very low employment rates in the STEM field because there will be very few students with expertise in this field. 

Thank you for your consideration.
