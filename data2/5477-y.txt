Shasha Yu I strongly approve that OPT should be extended for F1 students!

As referenced above, DHS give additional extension to STEM students in order to better ensure that that the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally. When I was choosing which country should I pay money to have education, OPT extension policy is definitely a main reason for choosing the US. Otherwise I will save half of the amount of tuition fee by going to Japan or England.

If the OPT extension is gone, DHS and the US will be a big lier for international students! Give my money back! Give my time back!
