I have been studying bio-medical science for my PhD and working on cancer genomic research in a national and international renounced hospital. My research expertise is the development of precision medicine and personalized therapy, which will impact whole medical care system in the US. My specialty in genomic medicine and computational biology and big data mining is in high demand in many pharmaceutical industries across US, especially there are not many US students studying in this field. OPT extension to 24 months will allow me to have more opportunity to join those pharmaceutical and genomic technology company or academic institution, in order to contribute my knowledge to the development of novel approach for early detection of disease and personalized therapy in US, which will benefit for the whole nation and reduced the burden of medical care in US.
