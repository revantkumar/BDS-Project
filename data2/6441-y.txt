Kenny L I Strongly support this rule. The OPT extension attracts many talented international students to come and contribute to the academia and industry of the US. If OPT extension were aborted, those international students may instead go to Canada, the UK, Australia, Japan or simply stay at their home country, and make those countries, not the US, stronger and more competitive in the world. Who would suffer from such loss? American people.
