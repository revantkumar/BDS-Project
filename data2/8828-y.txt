Bocong Zhao I really appreciate US government doing this for us. I fully support this rule. I saw a lot of talent and hardworking people cannot contribute themselves to this country because of their visa status, since H1B currently not open more available position for international people. . It's very helpless. A lot of students they spend a lot of money to study here, they want to have more opportunity and more time to get in touch with real life and prove what they learn. This way will help to get more practical experience.
