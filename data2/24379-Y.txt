Let's just be honest. The US education system is relying on nonimmigrant student. With the much less money they got from the government today, they need that money from nonimmigrant students to keep them functioning and providing good education situation for US students. So it's unfair to not give nonimmigrant students an equal chance to work and serve this society. It's against the basis of this country. Everyone should have a right.

And it's also a waste of resources if the country just let those skilled students leave, just to satisfy those unskilled citizens. Actually even without nonimmigrant students, those unskilled citizens may still not able to find a job just because they are not capable. So how could they blame everything on immigrant students.

Instead of setting barriers to well-educated legal students, people need to figure out how to reduce number of no-skilled illegal immigrants. That's the best way to keep this country healthy and strong.
