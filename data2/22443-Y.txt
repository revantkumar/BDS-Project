I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons: 

1. The graduate school spent time and funding on training graduate students with specific skills. And the government should keep them making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. 

3. There is competition but this is not a bad thing. It will inspire innovations in many different fields.
