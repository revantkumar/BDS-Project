I highly support this rule. In my opinion, the reason why the US is the top developed country is that the US welcome thousands of hi-tech students from all around world. Some adversary may say this rule cause competition, which intense the unemployment situation of US citizen, on the contrary, competition improve the creativity of technology of US, and creating more industry and job positions for citizens. At the same time, competition can increase efficiency. This rule will make the US a better place definitely.
