The OPT is basically a bonus given to employers to hire foreign graduates instead of Americans.
American graduates in STEM fields need these jobs and it is unfair to give companies an incentive to hire foreigners. Companies dont have to pay Social Security or Medicare taxes for these foreign workers.
OPT: takes away jobs from Americans and takes away funds from Social Security and Medicare.
