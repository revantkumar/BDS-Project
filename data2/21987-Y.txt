I strongly support this rule. Please do not forget, United States is a immigration country!!! How do we American come here by May Flower? 
We are immigrants! Every US citizen is immigrant!! 

Now, we celebrate Thanksgiving to be welcomed in this land. However, we even do not want these young adults to stay here for just 24 months to learn and work just like an intern. Are we crazy???
