I just feel that we should be training, and helping the American people to do these jobs , and not bring in people from other countries to take our jobs! I feel some times that they get better treatment from the government than we do . Spend the money to help your own people! If they want to be here bad enough? They can do the work their selves , like they did in the past , when they came here the legal way . And was not just handed everything so easily!
