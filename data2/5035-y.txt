Yushang Zhao I am a graduate student. And I came to US last year and graduate in this December. Fine, let me say some benefits of OPT Extension. First, US companies can hire most talented people, it's very important. Second one, cultural diversity. Third one, competition. Some people who opposed to OPT extension mentioned that if OPT is extended there will be less opportunities for Americans. Yes, it's true. However, people should not only consider what government can provide to them, but also need to think about, "what I can contribute to my country?" If there is no pressure, people would get used to their current situation and gradually give up improving themselves and striving for their future and this country's future. OPT Extension can be a good way for everyone to consciously improve themselves, and in turn, improve their working efficiency, and finally push the whole country forward. 

And, for us international students, we come to US for study, we pay more expensive tuition and other miscellaneous fee. We are supposed to get right to work.
