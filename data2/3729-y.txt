Jacky Chen Strongly support this extension, i'm an software engineer currently working for one of the american's biggest corporation. From my point of view, our nation's technology superiority heavily depends on our attractive technical immigration policy. I've worked with many talented foreign technicians or students, most of them gave me a impression of dedication, contribution and inspiration. Our company benefits a lot from those foreign computer science students, and they have been a pretty good compliment for the engineer team of our country.
