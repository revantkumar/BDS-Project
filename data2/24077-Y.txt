I support the OPT extension program.

American is a nation of immigrants. Those brightest students from all over the world will make great contributions to American economy. Just think about the high-tech companies founded or co-founded by the immigrants. They have brought a lot of profit and jobs to America. Some Americans may think the highly-skilled immigrants take their jobs away. However, without these immigrants, many jobs won't even exist! We shouldn't send these smart people back to their home country and compete with them later in the global market.
