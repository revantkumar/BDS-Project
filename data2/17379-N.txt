This is so unnecessary and un-American. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF THESE WORKERS AMONG AMERICANS. And ours are already trained.

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. 

It would be helpful if your agency would look out for Americans first. PLEASE DO NOT IMPLEMENT THIS RULE! 

I am already so disappointed with what Disney has done that I don't plan to ever spend another dollar on them. Please, Please, Please, do not do this to American workers.
