I support this proposal by the DHS to establish new rules of the OPT for students with STEM degrees for the following reasons:

1.The international students with STEM degree is an important part to keep the USA the most powerful country. We are facing a competition from China, EU in technology and economy every day, and the majority of the foreign students in science and engineering are from countries including China, India, Mid East. The current immigration law makes it very hard for these students to work legally in the United States even if they are hired by the high-tech companies. If we force them to return to their home country, they will only support the tech companies in their country and our highest level education system is just teaching and training students who work for our competitors. By setting up this OPT-extension, these students will have a chance to work in the United States and contribute to the industry here for at least 3 years and possibly longer if they apply for other types of visa later.

2.The international students in STEM fields will not have a bad impact for local workers. First, the STEM industry is in lack of human resource, so that a foreign student in those fields does not "occupy" a position for local workers. Second, the STEM field is highly paid and this is way beyond the minimum wage. For example, a fresh graduate software engineer who works in Apple gets paid more than $40 per hour, which by no means keeps the minimum wage from growing.
