I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Many famous people who have significant success in specialized field are from international students group.

3. Much more international students do not bring mind which rob Americans' job position to look for jobs. In the fact, some of jobs which is only international students can handle. I believe that competition can raise working efficiency and raise competitiveness of America. 

4. American feared that international student would like to rob the job position from them, therefore, they force government to make some policy to fight against the international student. This is an unwise action, America is a nation of immigrants, all of whom contribute to society their distinct talents.
