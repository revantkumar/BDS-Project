I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. OPT for Nonimmigrant student raise the standard of employee of American employers. As we all know, many international students are among the top of their majors or industries. Without them, the American employers can only hire secondary employees, which severely harm the benefits to their companies. Those who are commenting here against the proposal are mainly those secondary employees who always fail to fight for being a better employee. They don't know they need to put effort in making themselves a better person. They only know how to prevent those who are better than them from taking their jobs. If they succeed, they will keep being lazy and incompetent and be the only choices for American employers.

2. Diversity, diversity, diversity. America is the best country because it embrace the diversity more than any other country.
