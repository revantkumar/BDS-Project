I oppose the DHS proposal that would expand Optional Practical Training program for foreign students that allows up to 3 years without paying their share of payroll taxes. Not only does this program provide incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified and equally trained U.S. Citizens, but it also would likely violate the foreign student's pledge to their home country to return after completing their degree. American students that recently graduated in STEM are struggling to find work, thus this action would likely give the tech companies an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. 

I know a Stanford graduate, with a Masters Degree in Biomechanical Engineering, who won a national design team award for HP, however foreign workers kept his salary too low, then he was asked to go to China to transfer technology there. He left HP and changed fields so he could make a decent salary. Thus, I DO NOT believe that there is a true shortage of well educated American STEM workers and have met some over the years. I believe Congress created this "false shortage" by approving excessive numbers of F-1 visas to please Tech management to keep salaries low. 

American STEM graduates should be fully employed before expanding F-1 the way you propose. Opinions expressed are by an experienced, retired worker in this impacted industry.
