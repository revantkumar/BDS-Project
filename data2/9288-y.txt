Qi Wang I strongly support this extension of OPT to 24 months! The reasons are shown below.

The reason US companies hire foreign students is that there is no suitable Americans that can fit these jobs. Based on the US Department of Labor, there is only 5% of US workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. Very few Americans would take science and engineering related jobs thus the companies have to hire foreign people. For example, in the company I am working for, there are more than 50 employees, including only 4 foreigners. However, all these 4 foreigners are with PhD degrees and are all in the R&D department with total 10 people. If we are all forced to leave US because of the visa issue, then the R&D department will definitely be paralyzed!

A company is similar as a country. The foreigners in STEM fields are experts in science and engineering fields. They invent and develop new technologies for the United States, making huge contributions to the economic expansion for US. It is considered the "brain" of the country. If the inventors are all gone, the brain will be dead too. I cannot imagine how the US can keep the "NO. 1" in the world if the experts are moved to other countries, leaving only 5% people of the US people who can do science, math and engineering. The US should seek better ways to keep them in US instead of finding excuses to kick them out.
