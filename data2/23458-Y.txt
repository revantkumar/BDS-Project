This is a great rule for U.S.A. and also for foreign students who study here. It's a win win situation. I can see the benefits like higher economy, research, technological development, creating more and more job opportunities and ultimately contributing towards making U.S.A. the best country in the world. As a citizen I really think its a great rule

Please issue this rule as soon as possible.
