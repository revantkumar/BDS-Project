I absolutely support this rule for the following THREE reasons: 

1. Talented students who come to US to study deserves longer period to practice their skills show their ability after graduation. 

2. Students are well educated, a longer OPT would attract more oversee students coming to United States, making contribution to local economy. 

3. Giving everyone equal chance is one of the most fundamental spirit of United States.
