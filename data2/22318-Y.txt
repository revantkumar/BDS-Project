Well, obviously the "sorting by" panel in your comment page is not working. See? The needs for high tech workers are still expanding. STEM new grad F-1 students are the main source to fill in American high tech industry. In the past years, while the whole American economy was going down, the stocks of those high tech companies like Google and Facebook were still rising. The high industry is far from saturating, those STEM students are still in highly demand. How much you have gained from those F-1 students? American government will keep gaining much more if this rule is finally proposed. To expand the OPT extension means nothing if they cannot find a job, so what really makes them can find a job- America needs them! Most of the opposing comments are standing in the discrimination point, those STEM students are not taking away the jobs from the native Americans, they are helping, this rule is not giving them job or even immigration opportunities, it is for the high tech industry to hire good employees, whatever native or international.
