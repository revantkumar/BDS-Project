I strongly support the OPT extension. There are several reasons to support my argument.
First, OPT extension will give international students more time to practice their skills after graduation.
And international students will in turn make great contributions to the development of American economy and
Technology.
Second, OPT extension will be beneficial for American education. Because more and more international students will be attracted to study and work in America.
Third, once this rule is passed, the development of more fields will be boosted, such as mathematics, science, medicine research and so on.
