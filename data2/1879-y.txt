Max Blum This new regulation is GREAT news for US economy. International STEM student are potential entrepreneur and innovator. For example, more than three out of every four patents at the top 10 patent-producing US universities (76%) had at least one foreign-born inventor (source: http://www.renewoureconomy.org/research/patent-pending-how-immigrants-are-reinventing-the-american-economy-2/). More than 40% of the fortune 500 companies were founded by an immigrant or the child of an immigrant (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). America is a great magnet for the smartest people all over the world. This new regulation help keep it that way.

The economic case for legal immigration is overwhelming. International STEM students fill the gap in the labor force. They contribute to taxes, social security. They are far more likely to start their own companies and employ American workers. They make American competitive. If this regulation is NOT enacted, America risk a severe brain drain: international students can go back to their own countries or more welcoming countries like Canada and Australia. In time, company and jobs will follow them.

Smart people have already came to America. Enact this regulation and keep them here!
