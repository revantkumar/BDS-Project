Bo Yan I vote for the extension of OPT. 
Immigrants have always been playing a important role of United States. Thanks to the relatively friendly immigrant policy, American has always being attracting the most talented and skilled people across the world, who are contributing tremendously to the workforce. 
Some may argue that opportunities should consider being given to the Americans with a higher priority. In fact, protecting the citizens from competitions from all over the world greatly misinterpret the meaning of the "American Dream", which emphasize on an equal opportunity for immigrants and citizens alike. This would also damage the competitiveness for the citizens, as they choose to avoid the challenges. 
Employees in major technical companies like Google, Facebook, AT&T, etc are largely made up of new immigrants. Skilled immigrants are continuously contributing to the flourish of the Information Revolution, which will significantly change the way we live. The extension of OPT provides chance for students who newly graduate, so that they can focus on making their skills useful without many concern about being "expelled" legally.
