I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. Thousands of American citizens have lost their jobs to foreign workers. Many of them have been forced to train the foreign replacements. It's time to stop providing cheap foreign labor at all skill levels to corporations which have no regard for American workers and no loyalty to the United States.
