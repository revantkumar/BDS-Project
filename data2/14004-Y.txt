I support new rule for OPT extension proposed by DHS. According to my understanding, F-1 students that received higher education in the U.S are supposed to have opportunities to feedback to the U.S society. The new rule provides better environment for skilled students to make more contributions to America. Also, all the F-1 students are working adhere to federal law, and they pay taxes to federal government, thus there's no negative impact on U.S tax revenue .
Highly skilled STEM students deserve a place in high-tech field, which would be a benignant stimulation to scientific and technological development. In recent years, more and more STEM students got chances to participate in computer science industry, material science industry, chemical engineering industry, etc., and the rapid develoment boosted by foreign employees in these fields are obvious. However, without OPT extension rule, most of them are not likely to work in US and make their own efforts to technology development. 
Respecting diversity and encouraging enterprise are precious American spirits, which brace the triumph and flourish of the U.S, and OPT extension rule is a small profile showing American spirits. Please keep the valuable features of America, and implement the new rule.
