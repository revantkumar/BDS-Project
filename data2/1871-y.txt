Jianqi Zhang I strongly support this proposal. This will be a win-win strategy for both the US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. 

As an international student, I have just got my PhD degree in Biostatistics from University of Southern California. Beside of the dream of mastering statistics, one thing I was utterly curious about is, what makes the US so great that so many talented young people are willing to travel across seas to study there? With this question in mind I chose to go to US despite of all the great options I have in Europe and Asia. 

I have had a wonderful time in USC, learned a lot, made good friends, and I have been observing US as a foreigner for five years. I think now I have an answer to my original question: the US is great because of its ability to absorb the best people in the world to work for it, which attract more talented people as a positive feedback. As a STEM student, I feel it's especially true, and I cannot remember how many times I was inspired by brilliant students from Russia, China, Japan, India and Europe. 

The US has offered its best to educate talented people, and as an international student, I am truly grateful of it. I would be willing to practice my knowledge in the US to make some difference to the world, and at the same time, contribute something in return to the US.

However, with the current one-year OPT, it would be nearly impossible to do anything meaningful due to the complex nature of STEM. I am now working in a pharmaceutical company, which has provided many resources to train me as an entry-level statistician. While I heartily appreciate that the company sees my potential, one-year is too short to make true contribution.

Back to the question, why the US has the fastest computer, the coolest automobile, the most effective drug for hopeless diseases? Because it can get best people to work for it.
