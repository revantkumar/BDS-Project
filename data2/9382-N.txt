To whom it may concern,

Like so many programs in the long history of the Federal government's abuse of power the OPT program is being leveraged by the DHS to circumvent the RIGHTS of the Citizens of the United States. I submit 3 examples of how such abuse of power has occurred;

Example 1) The US Constitution, as a contract between the People of the United States, the several States of this Union and the Government of the Federation, was the device by which the Principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence were institutionalized into a Government that derivers its power from the consent of the Governed. In summary, the primary job (duty) of the Federal Government IS to protect the Sovereignty of the United States.

The Federal Government has steadily eroded this duty - that includes the protection of the rights of ALL Citizens of the United States, EQUALLY - by intruding into the authority reserved to the several States of this Union, respectively, and to the People. Instead of protecting our rights by protecting our National Sovereignty, the Federal government has taken on the duty of deciding what is good for the Citizens of the United States as a centralized Collective (one size fits all).

Example 2) Social Security was sold to Congress and the American people with the promise by Franklin Roosevelt that only those paid into the system would collect from the system. But the Federal government has worked tirelessly, not only to break that promise but to erase its memory entirely. Social Security has become yet another tool of Socialism to steal the wealth of the individual and distribute it to the community!! 

Example 3) The numerous Immigration Laws passed by Congress meant to protect our citizens and yet offer opportunity to those who wish to become American citizens and embrace our First Principles of Life, Liberty and Property as stated in the Declaration of Independence (please consider the original draft of the D of I concerning Property) - EQUAL
