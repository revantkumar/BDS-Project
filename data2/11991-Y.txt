I am in a support for the new proposal of increasing F1 OPT STEM Extension. It would be really beneficial for students if the they will get a 24 months of OPT STEM Extension instead of 17 months. With this students can gain more practical knowledge. Practical knowledge ca help them to think and solve more about the real world problems. We will get a great chance to explore new technological challenges. In this way if students will get more time they will explore more which will be beneficial for this nation's economy.
