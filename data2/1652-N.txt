I strongly oppose any further changes to the OPT program. The program already costs
American citizens jobs and legal immigrants who are educated in these fields that have come 
over under hardship conditions are currently prevented from working in their fields placing more
burden on our work force and welfare system that is un-necessary. These hardship workers 
and refugee's that are here should get preferential treatment based on their existing status 
before expanding another program.

The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the 
Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, 
especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to 
hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months 
in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly 
in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would
put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program 
actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to 
pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy 
should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
