I am 100% in support of this extension. It will encourage the best people to come to school in America and also provide them a stable platform to give back - and of course also make a living in the process.

Let us all remember that America was built on the collective contribution of people from eclectic backgrounds and places. The only thing these people had in common was a strive towards excellence.

The extra suggestion I could provide will be to raise the requirements bar as a control mechanism to prevent abuse of the system.

In all, great initiative!.
