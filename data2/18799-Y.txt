This is absolutely the right THING the government should do! Allowing foreign students that are well trained in STEM areas would definitely strengthen the competitiveness of American companies in the global markets, especially these high-tech companies. Some Americans complain that they cannot find a job because of foreign students took them away. It is so wrong and short-sighted. 1. Foreign students and immigrants contribute to the growth of American companies and U.S. economy and created more jobs; 2. Many of them started their own companies that create jobs. I strongly support this new rule.
