I strongly believe that stem extension should not be cancelled. 
1. Compare with other jobs, STEM related jobs need more time to be well performed, both training and actual 
doing of the job (a lot of engineering project can take a year or two to finalize). 
2. Considering the situation that the H1 B VISA for F1 students is based on a lottery system, the employer will not take the risk of hiring people that cannot possibly stay longer than one year or nine months if they did not get H1 VISA for the first time, which means that a F1 student can hardly find any training opportunities in the 90 days opt period. The employers are from the market and their first purpose is to make profit, they consider candidates for bringing profit not being trained.
3. Students being extended will not cause any problem to the society. In fact they contribute to the job market and help improve economics. They are all educated people with desent jobs.
4. The United Stated of America is an immigration country. It is the best country because it absorbs all the best people in the world. It opens doors for the people that are talented and need opportunities. The people in this land should never forget this! 
All in all, I think the government should not eliminate the opt STEM extension, but should be cautious about the consideration of the eligibility of the applicants. As long as they fulfill the requirements of the extension, their is no reason that he or she cannot stay in the States.
