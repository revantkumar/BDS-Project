I will definitely SUPPORT this proposal. 

The United States is regarded as a country with most diversity and equality of chance to succeed, it should still be in the future. 

Foreign students studying in American universities are mostly top students from other countries and get broad recognition from universities' faculty and employers. It will be a big loss to United States if these foreign students leave immediately after their graduation, without making any contributions to America's industry. As a result, development pace and employment opportunities in U.S. will eventually get hurt if foreign graduate students in STEM major are forced away.

Extended OPT period is a great method to boom the high-tech and green economy of U.S. Increased contribution from foreign STEM graduate students will further improve the living standard of Americans and bring more job opportunities for natives. Additionally, competition has never been a bad thing in U.S. history.

I believe the involvement of STEM students will continuously keep United States the top competitor in the world.
