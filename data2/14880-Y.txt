I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. International students should be given equal rights to work in the U.S. All man are born equal and U.S. is a nation built by immigrants. 

2. International students make a great contribution to U.S. economy and technology development. In high tech companies, foreign workers make a good percentage of all employees and many take key roles such as technical leader and manager. The proposal will benefit high tech companies and U.S. economy. And vice versa, vacating the OPT STEM extension proposal will detriment U.S. economy growth. 

3. People who worry international students took jobs from U.S. citizens do not realize the fact that current job market in U.S. favors U.S. citizen much more than international students. Many positions are open to citizens only. Many companies do not provide H1B sponsorship. International students need to possess more skills and talents than U.S. citizens to be hired for same position.
