Fingolfin Yuan I strongly support this proposal. I always believe that freedom and opportunity make America the greatest country in the world. The new opt rule will create a healthy and positive working environment in US. Indeed, this will increase competitors in US job market. But it will increase the comprehensive national strength of US in the long-term and finally benefit general people who lives in this country.
