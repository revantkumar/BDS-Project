This is just another example of how ridiculous our government has become. It isn't just Obama, but the entire
congress should be voted out and new blood voted in.
I can't even fathom the reasoning behind this law they are trying to get passed..I guess its like the impossible immigration
attitudes among our government. Why can't we take care of our own FIRST. ???
