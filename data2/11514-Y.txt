I am strongly in favor of new OPT extension rule. My reasoning is listed as below:

First, getting international student as employee increases competitiveness of tech companies. Nowadays due to globalization, it is very critical for tech companies to expand its business to foreign countries for larger market. Apple, Google, Facebook, airbnb, uber are actively seeking Asian markets and getting international student can help companies make better choice and strategy for localization.

Second, many projects in large technology companies take more than a year's time. When I interned in a Si image sensor company, I noticed that R&D of a project usually takes more than 2 years and let alone more time is needed to transform R&D projects into a real products. Without STEM OPT extension, international student can only work in short-term projects and cannot carry out long term projects. This makes tech company "short-sighted" and greatly lowers productivity and future development.
