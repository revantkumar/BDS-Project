Alex Johnson I support OPT extension for the following reasons:
1. As more companies are seeking for high-tech experts, more OPT means more time and opportunities for companies to hire and grow, which in turn brings benefits and prosperity for the country. If OPT fails to extend, then lots of high-tech people will not have enough time to get prepared into industry.
2. Competition does not mean unfairness, but means that candidates could get motivated to become better. If excellent foreign students/scholars leaves US due to time limitation, then it's hard for companies to ensure the hiring quality.
