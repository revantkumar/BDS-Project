I strongly support this new rule that is being proposed by DHS. STEM extension allows deserving students to get a good industrial exposure and provides them with an opportunity to use the knowledge gained in academics. As recruitment is based on merit and not on nationality, one should not be worried that this rule will take away American jobs.
