Please do not allow this rule. We have enough qualified STEM workers and especially IT workers who are US Citizens and unemployed/underemployed. 
There is the H1 program which imports tons of foreign STEM workers anyway. What is the idea of allowing students to work for 3 extra (or 6 in some cases) years. This breaks the whole idea of a STUDENT visa. This will be used by a lot of non-serious students to come here in hope of eventually working here and displacing local talent. There is already a "mafia" like environment of Indian IT companies. What are our lawmakers/executives thinking?
