Ze LI Strong Agree.
America is a multicultural country essentially and needs excellent employers from all over the world in order to become more international and increasingly strong day by day. In addition, internationalism is a trend for the world. I think America ought to catch that trend and provide chances for students from other countries, which also can show the Democratism of America. Why not let them make contribution to America?
