I oppose the expansion of OPT. Given the myriad of problems Americans face in a shrinking job market and tepid economy, this is not an appropriate time for increasing opportunities for foreigners. At the same time that this program helps outsiders, it also makes it more difficult for Americans to compete. As a society, we need to assist in the economic health of our own people and reinvest in their futures.
