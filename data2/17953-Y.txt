I strongly agree with this proposal. Me myself is working with OPT right now, in the Silicon Valley. I've seen several talented people have to go back to their home country because of the visa issue, and they all have PhD degree here. This is such a sarcasm: on the one hand, all the IT companies in the valley are finding it difficult to fill their positions, and on the other hand we are sending away those exact the same people that we needed, and not to mention those people are going back to their home countries (e.g., China) and build IT companies that compete with US.
