Yen Ying Lee To Whom It May Concern:

As an international student and a woman who are pursing a master degree in Electrical Engineering I believe the extension will have tremendous positive impacts on the U.S. economy and diversity on the technology field. First, the extension will allow American employers to have more time to evaluate their international talent before investing more time and money on them. By investing, I mean the long legal procedures as well as the cost to hire lawyers to apply for a green card. I strongly believe that the United State should keep on attracting the best from around the world in order to continue being the leader in science and technology field. Second of all, having the extension will help to diversify the technology company because they will less overwhelmed from the long legal procedure to hiring international student. This leads to American companies hiring people who holds different value and perspective to the world. It will create an environment that foster innovation and creativity because the unconventional to the American may be conventional someone else. As a result company will find a better representation of the global community and create better products. Finally, I want to conclude that the idea of extending OPT for student in STEM does not meaning that Americans are losing their job. This is because employers already know that hiring international students is a hassle, therefore, it also means that it is a program for the very skilled and talented to make America great.
