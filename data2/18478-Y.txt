If companies' purpose is to replace their employees with cheap foreigners, why don't every company do this? Why your government only give STEM students longer OPT extension? 
The real reason is that there are few native American studying these majors, and even fewer studying very well. Companies needs to develop, they need to hire more people who do well in these fields. 
It's hard for foreign students to get a job too, much harder than native people. A lot of students paid huge amount of money to study while they have to leave the US in the last. Only those who are outstanding can stay. Those people deserve the OPT period to show their value and search for a better life. 
We are not taking away your opportunities, those opportunities are prepared for valued people, no matter they are natives or foreigners. You cannot blame us for natives losing jobs.
