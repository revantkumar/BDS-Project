The OPT program was also designed to allow foreign students to gain work experience in their field of study that would help
them find work when they return to their home countries. But instead, the proposed extension for tech workers would, in effect,
create a bridge to an H-1B tech-worker visa and eventual employment-based green cards. Simply put, the OPT program is
an easy way for tech companies to recruit cheaper foreign workers at the expense of American workers and STEM students.

"American" graduates have enough problems finding jobs and do not need to be competing with foreign students for so few 
jobs. 

The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate
welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to
three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their
share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business
owners at the expense of American workers.
