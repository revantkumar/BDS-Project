Washington is run by money & greed. They keep helping the foreigners without those who are true Americans needing jobs, help with medical bills, and medicine. Nothing like turning your back on the American Vets and the true senior citizens who were born during WW1 and lived and had no help for there injured WW2 & Korean Vets. Thanks for burden of USA citizens who are in there final years being made to take a reduction in SS so we can pay more to those who yearly get a raise in Congress and will always have whatever they or their family needs.
