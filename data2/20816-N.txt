This Optional practical training program is being used as a back-door entry into high paying corporate jobs. Body shopping companies with foreign origin owners are using these programs to train and place students for a significantly lower salary than market rate. If this extension is raised to more than a year, it will hurt the chances of American workers significantly. I am a permanent resident and I'm scared this will severely hurt my job chances as these body shopping companies quote for way less than market rate which depresses wages
