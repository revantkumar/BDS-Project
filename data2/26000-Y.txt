Firstly i would like to thank DHS for coming up with really good proposal that would benefit all the concerned parties. There are couple of suggestions regarding the application of rule for existing students on OPT Extension.

1. Making it mandatory to apply before 120 days of end of 17 months extension would result in many students becoming ineligible to take advantage of the rule and thus void to great extent the original purpose of this rule. Instead I believe giving such students a chance to again apply for remaining 7 months of extension within 60 days ( Time given to them to leave US) after the 17 month extension has expired would end up giving more students if not all, a better prospect to take advantage of this rule. They still wont be able to work as work permit has expired but they can legally stay like in the case of cap-gap and wait for their renewed EAD card.

2. For certain students in CAP-GAP (With EAD expiring before 1st April) work authorization should be provided as they have a employer filling their H1B but they have to wait till Oct 1st (If there H1 is apporved) to start working or resume working. This makes cap-gap not that effective. If a student is considered a highly skilled labor then making that labor sit idle for 6 or more months is not fruitful to any involved parties. I believe if the employer of such students (who have their EAD expiring no earlier then 60 days (time for them to leave US ) before 1st April (Date of H1B filing)) is providing consent to file H1 for that student then such students should be provided with a extended work authorization till Oct 1st (H1B status start date provided they were approved).

Once again I would like to thank DHS and all the employees of USCIS that work so hard to provide many students like me all the help and support to overcome this tedious task of maintaining legal status in this land of free.
