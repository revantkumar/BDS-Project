Paul G. There is nothing more permanent than a temporary visa. The 12 months currently available to F-1 visa holders is more than enough for practical experience they can take home with them to their country. The only reason to extend this to 24 months is to allow them more time to find a job, and keep an American out of work. 

There are stories in the media weekly about major companies laying off Americans and then hiring visa holders. This happens to reduce wages, and for no other reason.

The entire text of the proposed rule change talks about how this benefits foreign workers and keeps universities stocked with foreign students. Nothing in there addresses the harm the existing visa programs, F-1, H-1b, and others, have done and will continue to do to American workers. Fraud in the H-1b program is will documented and widely reported, providing ample reason for concern about the F-1 visa program.

Please do not make this rule change. Americans are hurting. Help us.
