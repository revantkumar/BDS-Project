I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am a Chinese student and now a computer engineer master candidate. I have to say that after graduation I got several offers both in England and U.S.. And a good offer in industry in China, too. The reason I choose U.S. is the opportunities in industry after graduation in U.S. , though it is expensive than the program in England. I thought i can improve the skills and the ability. However, if I know the OPT will become short, which means less opportunities after graduation before I came here, I will consider the offers in England. So you can image what will happen if OPT cuts. More talented people will go to other countries instead of U.S..It will hurt one day.

And actually 12 + 24 months are suitable for research. Some research, like the biology branches, need at least 2-3 years for a good output. They cannot make progress if the time is limited.

And for economy, almost all the foreign students pay the tuition themselves , which makes profit to education industry and improve the quality of education for the citizens. 

Hope more people will support this good rule.Equality makes U.S. U.S..
