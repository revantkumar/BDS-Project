Sean Huang I think OPT extension would be a good resource for international students to contribute to the companies in the US. Also, the OPT program is one of the significant difference distinguished from the other countries. It allowed international students to stay for some time and practice what they've learned from the program. That's why so many international students are coming to the country to study. And if more international students come to US, more tuitions, more rentals would need for them and this is really good for the improvement of economics.
