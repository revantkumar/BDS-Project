Pratap Singh I strongly support the proposal to extend F-1 non immigrant student optional practical training (OPT) time to 24 months, because it gives a fair chance for the international students who invest a fortune to get educated in USA to get back there their investment and pay off their ever expensive education loans and also help them gain invaluable experience relating to their field of study. At the same time the US companies or employers also can benefit from the smart and hardworking international brains. In all, a very good proposal and hoping to be see it in action very soon. Thank you DHS for proposing this rule!!
