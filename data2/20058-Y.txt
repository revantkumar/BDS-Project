I strong agree with this improvement!

If there have two choices, 
- one is go to anther country with friendly training opportunities policy after graduate, and to be a experienced when they go back home.
- another one is go to US without friendly training opportunities policy also with highest tuition fee! and when they come back to home, company treat them as a new graduate, the same with other candidates who study in their home but with much lower tuition.

which one will you choose?

I cannot image how it affect the whole US education system once the STEM cannot work after 12months. If I were them, I will definitely to choose other countries with friendly training opportunities rather than US. everyone knows the tuition is US is huge and increase every year. No one want to join in a education system with more tuition fee and without training opportunities after graduate and before they come back to their home. Most of the student would like be a competitive in the job market when they come back.
