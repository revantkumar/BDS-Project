Charles Stogner The duration of OPT should be zero, rather than 36-months. The concept of allowing aliens, who are not students by any definition of the word, to remain in the United States and work is in conflict with the purpose of student visas and should be reevaluated.
OPT is a solution in search of a problem: 
DHS says the purpose of expanding OPT is to attract more foreign students through mentoring programs. But in 2008, DHS justified expanding OPT to provide labor to industry. Why the inconsistency?
DHS failed to consult in advance with anyone who might be opposed to the measure. 
Various groups in support of this measure have posted on their web sites that DHS has discussed this measure with them to solicit ideas and concerns over that past year. Under Executive Order 13,563, DHS is supposed to provide 60 days of comment. Without any explanation DHS has cut the comment period in half (even the 2008 OPT Rule gave 60 days for comments). That gives those DHS has excluded from the rulemaking process up to now, limited to time get the word out and to do research to prepare meaningful comments.
OPT runs counter to Congressional intent: Congress has been explicit that student visas are not to be used as a means for immigration. 
It has been even more specific that work on student visas it not to be used to prepare for immigration. In reading through the comments made by foreign students, it was striking how many of them supported OPT as a vehicle to remain in the United States. 
There is no educational aspect to OPT. 
Comments in favor of OPT indicate that the chief benefit is being permitted to remain and work in the United States beyond the terms of a student visa.
The "mentoring" program is just window dressing for cheap labor. 
DHS is telling employers to set up a new mentoring system that has never existed without providing any guidance on how these mentoring programs are to be set up. The likely result is that employers will just go through the motions to provide whatever paperwork DHS requires without going any further.
If mentoring programs have the value DHS asserts in the proposed rule, should not Americans have the same benefit? 
Several commentators have observed that American students cannot get such mentoring programs from industry. E.g. ICEB-2015-0002-3573, ICEB-2015-0002-4756. Why is DHS requiring employers and universities to do so for alien workers?
The Proposed Rule ignores the impact on American workers and "STEM" graduates. 
DHS predicts the number of non-student aliens working on student visas will be greater than the H-1B quotas. Currently half of American graduates in "STEM" fields cannot find jobs in "STEM" fields after graduation. A number of the commenters have noted the problem American workers have finding jobs in STEM fields. E.g. ICEB-2015-0002-3470, ICEB-2015-0002-5532, ICEB-2015-0002-5528, ICEB-2015-0002-5619.
A three-year term for OPT is excessive. 
The average time a new graduate stays at a first job is only 18 months.
The proposed rule creates national security issues. 
Requiring schools to track former students who have not been in attendance in the last 3- to 3-1/2-years is unrealistic and creates a security issue. 
A number of commentators noted the obvious: the proposed rule will discourage Americans from studying STEM fields. 
E.g., ICEB-2015-0002-3316, ICEB-2015-0002-2994. Many commentators noted that family members cannot find technology jobs. ICEB-2015-0002-4738. Already, half of Americans studying in those fields cannot find a job related to their education. As a number of other commenters noted, DHS is encouraging aliens to enter the U.S. STEM job market under taxation terms that make them much cheaper to hire than Americans. ICEB-2015-0002-3576. DHS is also requiring employers to provide these foreign guestworkers mentoring programs that are not available to Americans.
