Xuejiao Li This is a great opportunity for U .S. Companies and foreign students. The more diversity will be show in the company when you hire more foreign people. The way different culture thinks maybe different and you can learn from other cultures. I am a foreign student working in a top automotive OEM. Nowadays, the automotive industry increases selling in foreign countries. I can help my team understand the Chinese market better when think about what Kind of vehicle people like. The company I am working in also encourage diversity in the company. And U.S. is a immigration country and people come from different countries working together and build the country. If there are two more years OPT extension can be approved, there will attract more foreign people go to U.S. I bought my car here, I pay my rent and a lot tuition fee. I pay tax. All of this helped the local economy. I was a student in UM-Dearborn. And came to U.S. on 2011. At that time, my school has no dormitory and because more than 300 international students came to my school every year. We build the dormitory. The foreign students also helped local business like restraint and shopping malls.
