What are Obana and Congress thinking???? There is a record low participation of American workers in the work force. Unemployment is still too high with some folks working numerous part-time jobs to make ends meet or only being able to find one part-time to have some sort of employment. American DOESN'T need Obama's and Congress' plan to bring in foreign workers. We NEED to get AMERICANS back to work!
