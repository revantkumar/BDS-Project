I strongly support this proposal. Many students spent a lot of money studying in U.S. because U.S. provides the opportunities for them to get a professional training. And we know, many engineers are foreigners in Silicon Valley, they are the core role in building high-tech companies. All in all, a proposal like this is very beneficial to U.S. economy.
