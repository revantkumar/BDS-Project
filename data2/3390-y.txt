Xuan Liu I SUPPORT the new OPT rule. 

As science-related projects usually take people years to complete and make breakthroughs, it is valid to extend the term of OPT to enable international researchers to work here for a longer time. For example, one of my friends works as a biology research assistant at Duke University, and she has spent more 3 years on her academic project to explore new findings. Thus, if the new OPT rules cannot be applied, those talented international researchers have to leave without completing the scientific works. Consequently, the research teams they work with will unfortunately face with a brain-drain, lowering the whole pace of scientific exploration in America. If the U.S wants to keep its competence in the STEM academic field in the world, it is reasonable to activate the new OPT rule because it will allow international researchers work for America for a longer time and bring more breakthroughs.
