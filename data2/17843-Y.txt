United States is the country with super power in the world right now. In recent years, it ranked 1st in GDP among all countries with only 300 million people. However, this country cannot live on the past numbers. To maintain as the super power country, US needs most intelligent people around the world. US education system has done an amazing job in providing highest quality of education thus attracts the best young people around the world. If this STEM extension bill is passed, US has more opportunity than any other country in the world to keep those intelligent people in US and build US to maintain its super power. 

US is a very open country, open to culture, to open to speech, which made it very attractive for young people with a backbone and would like to create their future instead of waiting. Country's competition ends on people's competition. Acquiring the most intelligent people around the world determine the future of this country. 

People who built and already immigrated to this country could say no to this bill, just a way showing that they don't want to maintain the the most valuable and attractive nature of this country, openness. It is this nature that made what US is today. US government could say no to this bill and protect the workers here, they would not lose their competition within US, but US would lose its competition around the world.
