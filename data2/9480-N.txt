Stop all of this chipping away at the fabric of our country with the foreigners allowed to trespass and steal from us under the
guise of being poor, persecuted and in need of an American education, shelter and everything else we can give them for free.
Helping people is one thing, giving away our futures and the bank is quite another. Just because he can, does not mean he 
should grant everyone everything they want just because they are a foreign person. 

We have to draw the line and stop all of it, reassess what we are doing and cut back on what we can cut back on and stop
what is just ridiculous and detrimental in the immediate. If it is detrimental now, it will be devastating later. Obama should be
impeached for what he is doing with his last year in office.
