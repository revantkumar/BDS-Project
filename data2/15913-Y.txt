History has proved that the skilled immigrants made significant contributions to the prosperity of U.S. The new rule will definitely help these talented and hard-working foreign student to have a better chance to be strictly trained, join companies in STEM areas and contribute to the growth of America's economy. This will strengthen American companies' competitiveness in the global market because they have the BEST employees who have received the best education in U.S. Therefore, I strongly support the 24-month extension rule.
