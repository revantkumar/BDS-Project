Elizabeth Gonzalez I support the OPT extension !

You want to lose your job faster? You want your family and friends lose their job ? GO DO IT, kick all foreign students out of this country.

According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. Actually, because of them, we can have so many jobs available right now ! 

THINK ! PEOPLE THINK !
