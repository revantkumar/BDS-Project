The new rule seems designed to add new foreign workers to the system, making it an ideal new labor source for companies like Disney that are in the process of replacing their American workers with foreign temp workers already. Since the expanded OPT program proposed in the new rule excludes these new workers from payroll taxes, firms would likely realize more than $11,000 in payroll tax savings, including the 7.34% the workers would have paid themselves. This will likely take about $5 Billion each year from revenue needed to support America's current retirees. 

Please stop this new rule. It is only a way around Congressionally mandate guest worker limits.
