I disagree with this proposal. The fact that so many of our young people having graduated from colleges and universities are having a difficult time finding jobs in their chosen fields makes this proposal just another impediment to their search. We seem to have more concern for outsiders than for our own. All the good feelings in the world are useless if they make life more difficult for those who will eventually have to pay for the benefits we now enjoy.
