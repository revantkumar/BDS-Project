Tao Feng As a STEM student, I fully support this proposal. 

A) As long as the US is an immigration country, there should be some legal ways for immigration. Just think about these three types of immigration, if Americans must have one of them, which one do you think is the best choices for the good of the people and the country?
1,Someone who breaks the laws to enter and stay in this country
2,Someone who obeys the law but lack of education and work skills
3,Someone who obeys the law and highly educated with skills that can help the country.
Unless you think the choice is either 1 or 2, then I see no reason not to provide STEM students a way to stay here legally. 

B) If the US wants to continue being the leading superpower in the world, it requires an edge in science and technology, i.e. STEM field. Currently in the US, more than 50% of the STEM students/postdocs are from Asian (China, India, Korea), roughly 20% from Europe, and another 20% from middle east and other places. Only 10% student is born in the US. While the numbers may not be exact, it is not to far from the truth. If there was no OPT extension and all international students were send home, which country do you think will be the next superpower? China, India? Do you really believe US will still be a leading country in science without scientists? 

C) Some of you may think that the presents of foreign STEM students is the reason that drives regular American students out of STEM fields. Is that true? Think again. Which word do you use to describe kids who love nothing but science in high school? Nerd! Do you think you will continue pursuing scientific careers being called like that? Or do you want to be one of the "cool kids" who play sports? So instead of blaming foreign students for the fact that few American students want to be scientist, is it more reasonable to blame footballs or basketballs?
