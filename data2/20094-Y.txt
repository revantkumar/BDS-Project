I support OPT Extension because a fact: When there is an opening position and the budget is fixed, the employer want to hire the candidate with the best professional skills. In many cases, an international student is the most optimized option for the employer. We know that many companies have serious interviews with difficult exams. Senior employees sometimes get involved too. Those interview process are not designed to find which candidate's salary is potentially lower. They are meant to select the candidate who suit the position the most. 

Some argue that international employees got American citizens' job. It is true only in a very small scope. For American economy, international employees are human capital and they help to create more economy growth and more positions for others. For example, in IT and Engineering industries, many international employees have been participating in developing high-tech products and services. The better the products and services are, there would be more jobs of Marketing, Sales, Client Relation, Maintenance and so on.
