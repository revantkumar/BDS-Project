Dear Mr. Johnson

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at Northeastern University in Boston MA. A large number of students at the University are F1 visa students. Me and a lot of fellow students are going to get affected by the proposed rule. 

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. I am planning to use my OPT working as a Software Engineer with a company called Wayfair. The company is located at the iconic Copley Square area of the Boston City. Working at the organization would help me gain practical experience which I want to leverage when I move back to my home country to find better Job opportunities. 

OPT and OPT extension is important to be because a lot of students come to US with little or no experience and this would provide such students with opportunity to grow technically and personally in their respective field of studies. 

I am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule. 

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Thanks
Govinda
Northeastern University
