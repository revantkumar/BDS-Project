Chicheng Sun I strongly support this proposal based on experience of myself and that of many friends. One year after graduation while on F1 OPT, many of us face the problem of how to continue our jobs even though our employers are highly satisfied with our performance and we love the job. H1B is the way to go, but current H1B lottery system makes it highly unreliable. Instead of focusing on our jobs and enjoying our lives, we have to invest significant amount of time and money to deal with work authorization issue year after year. With this proposed extension of STEM OPT to 24 months, we would have more time to establish ourselves either in industry or in academia. 

The approval of this proposal would benefits not only international students but also the US. After all, the major reason why the US leads the world in innovation is because it attracts and retains global talents.
