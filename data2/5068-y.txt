Jenny Moss You know what? If not this OPT extension policy, most of the international students would not even consider about come to study in our country. Have you guys ever seriously consider about how big a loss it could be if this happens? NO enough talents with proficient skills to work in our industry any more. That would be a huge disaster. For god's sake please you guys open your eyes and look at this again. I personally do support this policy.
