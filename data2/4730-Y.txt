It will definitely be a good idea to have more outstanding foreign students working in the US. 

For a company, if there is an open position and two people (one foreigner and one citizen) who have the same ability are applying, the company will surely hire the citizen because it will cost more to hire a foreigner and make them stay legally. Thus, only outstanding foreign students would survive in the job market.

Having excellent foreign students working in the US will surely boost the US's economy because this raises the ability level of the labors in the US. An increasing economy will surely give birth to more job opportunities for the whole society, which will be a benign cycle for both the US citizens and the foreign students.

We should not take the number of open positions as a static figure, because it is absolutely a dynamic figure which has a strong correlation with the development of the economy. Letting the foreign students work legally will not decrease the job opportunity, but will help the US's economy and create more chances for everyone.
