I strongly protest the passage of the OPT incentive program. First it robs our children and grandchildren of higher level jobs; secondly it robs Social Security of payment into that program all Americans are forced to pay into; third, it encourages corporations to be dishonest with tax dollars; and fourth, it shows just how LOW our leadership has sunk by trying to pass an illegal act without Congress' approval.
