International students have the right to say a word about OPT extension. In the past few years, STEM students are able to contribute themselves in different fields within 29 months after their graduation. 
Actually they have done a lot for better United States. In my own field, computer science, there're many international graduates who have been doing well in their positions. 
1.They contribute the society with their solid and excellent knowledge background.
2.They pay taxes just as a United States citizen.
3.Many of them are involved in critical research projects in big companies or institutes, in order to create better life for human being.
4. Many of the STEM areas, especially computer science field, may not develop like today if OPT extension is canceled, since big companies need to invest much more on hiring technical people.
5. Actually international students contribute a lot during their OPT extension, they are bringing good to United States society.
