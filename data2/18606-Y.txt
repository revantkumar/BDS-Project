I am an American who has been displaced by this and similar tactics by a government who is supposed to serve American citizens while protecting them from enemies, both foreign and domestic.

My crime?

I was born an American Citizen.
I served in the United States Navy as a Radioman from 13 Oct 1976 to 19 Oct 1982 where I learned that I was very good with technology, both hardware and software.

From 1976 till 2002 I never went a day without working in the top 10% of all jobs in America.

From 2003 till 2010 I was able to find a small project to keep me afloat each year.

Since 24 Aug 2010 there has been NOTHING.

It took me a long time to understand all of the pieces.

Since I have been displaced by laws like this, I believe I have earned the right to show you why this is detrimental to America and the American citizens that our government at the federal and state level have an obligation too.
