I strongly believe OPT Extension will benefit United States a lot in may aspects.

Our universities will have more income because more international students will come to United States to study STEM majors, therefore we will have more money to build our education system and conduct academic research.
Secondly, engineers on STEM OPT Extension are mostly very hard working and talented young guys who are willing to do dirty works and ask for relatively low salaries. They will make great contribution to our economy and make our companies more competitive among other countries.
Thirdly, United States is a place where every hard working person will succeed. Cancel the STEM OPT extension will go against this tradition. Making our nation a place where every hard working will be rewarded by their contribution will attract more creative, skilled engineers come to our country and our country will keep leading in the world.

Therefore, I definitely agree the proposed STEM OPT Extension policy.
