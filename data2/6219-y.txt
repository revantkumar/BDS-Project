John Douglas I think the OPT extension is great!

As a senior engineer in an IT company, I really hope all the graduates with a STEM degree can obtain the 24-month extension. I have interviewed hundreds of international students who applied for engineer positions in our company in the last three years, and I really admire these young people.

All the international students I recruited are smart, and hardworking at the same time. They have strong knowledge and intelligent brain, they learned everything so fast. These students really make our company better. I cant understand why some people say that international students are unqualified and uneducated. This is so absurd!

No doubt that engineer positions are open for U.S. citizens, but few citizens apply for engineer positions. We have to recruit a lot of international students who are qualified engineers.

Another reason I support the extension is that many programs and researches in our company last more than one year, and some researches might take three to four years. If the OPT is only one-year, how can we continue our researches without our researchers? A three-year OPT sounds reasonable to me.

So I really hope the new policy can be effective soon.
