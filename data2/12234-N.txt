DO NOT expand the OPT! We have too many Americans who are unemployed, too many young American college grads who will be passed up by employers who want to hire CHEAP foreign labor, and not pay in to Social Security or FICA. 

Too many companies in the US are firing Americans and hiring H-1B visa workers instead for cheaper, leaving many American IT workers out of a job.

"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class." - Ian Smith.
Expanding OPT will continue to destroy the American middle class and will cost thousands of Americans career opportunities. College graduates and people under 35 make up one of the largest demographics in the US. We do not need to import people of that age to work when there are millions of Americans in that age group already who need career opportunities.

Allowing foreign college graduates to work in American for free or next to nothing is also a national security risk. 

DO NOT expand the OPT.
