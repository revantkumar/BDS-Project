We should be focused on employing and training the millions of citizens out of work in our country. We do not need to import people who would take those opportunities away from our citizens. We need to manufacture in the U.S. Again instead of sending our jobs overseas. I believe our people want to work, but not in a fast food restaurant or cleaning a motel room, but a job with a future to take care of their families. I am concerned about the incentives the government provides to people who come here illegally. Let's instead spend the money on keeping our own people employed by providing incentives for companies to stay in the U.S. And manufacture here.
