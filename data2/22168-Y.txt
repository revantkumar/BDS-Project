I strongly support the OPT extension for both the benefits of international students and US citizens. Following are my reasons:
1. From my experience in U.S., I think one of the most important reasons that U.S. is the strongest country in the world and people here enjoy good living is that U.S. attracts top-talents all around world. Those talents will contribute to U.S.'s economy and some of them use their innovations to create a lot job opportunities. Those contributions will benefit a lot of people in U.S., including both U.S. citizens and non-citizens.
2. U.S. universities attracts lots of international students every year. Many of those students contribute a lot to the researches that help U.S. maintain its leading position in sciences and technologies. In addition, international students bring a considerable amount of tuition to U.S. universities, which the universities can use to improve themselves and provide better education and research opportunities. This forms a virtuous circle for U.S. universities and benefit U.S. students as well.

If OPT extension is cancelled, U.S.'s attraction to global talents will drop and may lose its advantage our other countries. From my two points above, I think this will hurt U.S.'s research and economy in a long term, which then will in turn hurt people's living qualities in U.S., including U.S. citizens'.

Therefore, I strongly support the new rule of OPT extension.
