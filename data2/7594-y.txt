ANIL KRISHNA MANNE I strongly support this rule to be passed. I believe that, Extending OPT Stem Extension is a good idea because, the immigrants who applied for stem extension were already proven people with a good level of graduation in education and better at their skills in limited period, let them give a chance to prove themselves. There is a some kind of difficulty in the employee monitoring policy during the extension period because, hiring an immigrant is a bit difficult task and may be from manager level or supervisor may feel as burden due to the additional paperwork to be submitted. So employer's may not recruit the immigrants due to the additional work when compared to the Citizens and Green Card holders. Obviously they would prefer a citizens instead of immigrant due to lot of responsibilities to be maintained all the time with them.
