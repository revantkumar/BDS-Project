I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule. First, with a longer practical working experience training in the United States, students from foreign countries are more willing to come for the education (B.S, M.S, Ph.D) and pay for the tuition. If the OPT is cut into one year only, that's too short. A degree itself won't allow the students to pay for large amounts of money for training. They also need practical working experience training. Second, it won't hurt the job opportunities for United States citizens. H1B hurt it. Overall, it is beneficial to the United States and will not cause extra harm.
