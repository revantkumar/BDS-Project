I've read several comments and realized that some people think government and big companies can save money by hiring foreign students cause foreign students accept lower wages. However, the stem students usually have higher annual income than average. The big companies and government hire foreign students because they are smart and skillful! They can make contributions to this country! American is a open minded country with advanced technology and inventions. Those intelligent students can truly help a lot!!!
