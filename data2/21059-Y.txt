As an US citizen, I do feel shame on some of my fellow Americans here, who treat American citizenship as the greatest wealth they have. You guys are the very people that make America a nation that is going downhill, a nation that is not as attractive as it was, a nation that cannot defeat terrorism and communism, and a nation that is losing control of the world.

My point of view is very clear - yes, OPT-extension is NECESSARY for our country. STEM are crucial fields when it comes to driving innovation. STEM students are still small in quantity. As a citizen, OPT-extension might mean kinda competition, but competition is never a bad thing. It can make us and our country progress.
