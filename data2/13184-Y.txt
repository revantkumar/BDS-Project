As a international student, I strongly agree with extension! I read other comments by U.S citizens. The most reason they against is that they cannot find job. But plz note that extension is just for S.T.E.M students. As far as I know, most of people who study in those fields are international students. Which means many American students study business, financial, arts... For international students who are in those fields, they do not have OPT extension. Thus, extension cannot be the reason for unemployment of American students. If extension is cancelled, I think U.S will lose many quilted people who contributed a lot to America. 

For international students, it is hard to find a job even with OPT extension. A employed international student must have high G.P.A, must be skillful, must good at English. Such excellent student can contribute more than a low G.P.A U.S student! 

For those who against extension just argued they cannot find a job. I want to say, please make yourself more competitive. If not, even though OPT is cancelled, you still cannot find a job!

So, for the benefits to both U.S and international students. I highly recommend OPT extension!
