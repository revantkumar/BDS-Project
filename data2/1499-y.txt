Sheng Lee As a F1 student I strongly support the proposed rule ICEB to extend the OPT. For those citizens with the opposition idea, I encourage you to think, I mean, use your brain to think, not your toes, what is the purpose of this OPT? This is an opportunity for foreign students to gain actual experience on what they learned in school. It's part of the education they're taking. Before that they are leaning hard in US school for years for a price, they paid much more expensive tuition, which support school funding, enhance research activities and culture variety in campus. The massive growing number of foreign students is not grabbing job opportunities from US citizens, but it create thousands of job positions. They deserve such training opportunities. 

Today in Silicon Valley, Texas, Midwest, East coast, all the most thriving area of America, a great amount of companies are offering either internship or work opportunities for OPT students. In companies especially the big ones it's common to see people from different countries. Have you thought about why that is happening? This is called globalization! It's a non-stoppable trend! In this economy condition, US companies is trying to expand their market overseas. This is a chance for US to create but not lose job opportunities. OPT students' work is a part that is helping this globalization process. Believe it or not companies need OPT students so that's why they are giving these training opportunities. Don't forget, America is an immigrant country, whatever it is now or future, admit it or not, there will be more and more immigrants from other countries. These people came here not simply for a job, they came here for so called "American Dreams". For those people who are lazy, not even trying to get education and a job, they'll never understand the true meaning of "American dream" and what OPT really means for the students and the US.
