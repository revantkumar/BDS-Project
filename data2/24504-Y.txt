I think this is really useful at all in sum.

First, the extension is become longer, which let people have more time to contribute themselves, also students just graduate will have more time to acquire experience in this country.

Second, the time need to find a job also decrease to just one month, which means only the best elite can survive in this situation, which is good for company who pursue the best people.

With the change of opt stem, I think it is a good idea to let USA become a better country.
