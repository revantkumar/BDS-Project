OPT affords people from other countries the opportunity to work here in the United States and gain valuable experience to take back home with them. Hence the term training. Extending it would only allow them more time to gain more knowledge to be used in furthering the development of their respective countries. In this way the US is performing a service to the rest of the world. The good thing about this is that PRIVATE non government institutions foot the bill in wages etc. And it is up to the discretion of the PRIVATE COMPANY , not the US government, and based on merit whether they want to help keep the international person in the country through the h1b program etc. 
The function of the US government in this case is to facilitate the LEGAL training of STEM graduates.

I understand that people are hesitant because they think it means less jobs for Americans. That is an extremely ignorant statement. The US has a deficiency in STEM jobs that international students are filling. Kicking out the thousands that graduate this year and in the future would open up a vacuum that the current US national pool of graduates cannot fill. This in turn would have a negative effect on the economy and the productive output of the country. Less people would want to go to school here in the U.S ,schools will lose money in lost international tuition and may hike up tuition for local students. Skilled workers would leave the country and go to others where they are more welcome etc. I don't see how this is a win for anyone.

This is a land that was built on the innovation and hard work of immigrants. Unless you are native american, your ancestors immigrated into the US for an opportunity to better their lives and that of their families and are part of what makes this country great. It would be incredibly disingenuous to disallow a legal method for the worlds most skilled individuals to do the same and live the American Dream.
