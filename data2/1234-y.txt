Naveen Runthla I strongly support the OPT extension rule for the STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) graduates. There is huge shortage of STEM graduates in USA, and lot of IT companies have to rely on H1B visa to hire foreign graduates. But if STEM graduates in USA got the OPT extension, it will be easy for companies to find the right talent. OPT and OPT extension really enhances the skill set of the foreign graduates which is really for their better future and this is how companies and students will get the benefit. And definitely there will be boost in economy because students pays all the taxes during their work in OPT and OPT Extension and help in the growth of the business in each organization.

STEM graduates should get the OPT Extension for 2 years.
