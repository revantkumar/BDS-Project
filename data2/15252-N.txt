I want to voice my objections to the plan.to expand training opportunities for foreign students. It is not your role to expand training opportunities for foreign students at the expense of American workers. Neither is it your role to incentive companies to avoid paying payroll taxes which would bolster the social security fund. As for Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, I would like to see them use some of the millions they use grandstanding for "ending world poverty" to insure that Americans keep their jobs and retraining those who need it. I am 62 years old. I have been listening to discussions for decades about American engineers who lose jobs because companies can hire foreign students and pay them less money. Now, your intentions are to make things worse. I also remember reading that the notion that there is a shortage of Americans in IT is a fallacy because wages in IT are stagnate and, if there were a real shortage, that would not be the case. This is just another example of companies seeking to drive down wages as everyone wonders what happened to the middle class. Please don't make things worse.
