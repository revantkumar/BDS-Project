This is the great rule to make sure international students to gain practical experience and I hope this rule can be implemented.

I want to discuss two points I found with the rule
1) Firstly I want to dispute arguments from anti immigration groups

Some anti immigration groups argue that " The Regulation and definitions ensure that there are no similarly situated U.S. worker. The Regulation deflect the issue away from this U.S. worker or this employer to other employers of the same [undefined] size anywhere in the world. Lastly, the Regulations require comparison of students with U.S. workers that is the proverbial apples vs. oranges false comparison, leaving U.S. workers with no protection by definition since no worker can ever be similarly situated to a student".

This logic is flawed, when a student is employed by a company, he/she is an employee and will be judged in the same category as US workers. There is no "apple vs orange" comparison. Also, if a similarly situated US worker is not found, that exactly proves the student's skills are very in need and this should further qualify his/her employment. Also, as an international student working in US worker, I have at least three US colleagues that perform similar work as I did and earn similar salaries as I do. Saying "no similarly situated US worker can be found" is very wrong

2)Secondly, I have question about the mentoring program:

For the mentoring program, there should be better guidelines about what it is. what kind of document shall be submitted? is there any difference between the mentoring program and a working plan for an employee? Is it practical or meaningful to have such a mentoring program? As an employee in US company, we know that employees should be proactive. My manager do not have the obligation to tell me exactly what I shall do. I need to find work and ask questions by myself instead of being assigned with "mentoring"
