As an hr, I could feel pressured to find a competitive candidate for the job, especially when I hopped to an IT company. Many jobs are ignored by our citizens but in high demand. It would be ridiculous to say those Asian students with OPT rob Americans' jobs, since most of Americans even get into the competition for those jobs. If any american with qualified skills for the job, he or she tends to get the job much more easily, in the general case, than those graduate under OPT. So what I want to highlight is that the OPT extension has little impact on job-hunting of Americans, which means the concerns from those against this proposal, in fact, is extremely unjustifiable.
