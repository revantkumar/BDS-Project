Guocan Li I am strongly supportive for the proposed rule, which will greatly benefit the country. International students in STEM fields have contributed greatly to the development of the United States, both scientifically and economically, and it would be a mistake to lose these highly educated people. Elongating STEM extension from 17 months to 24 months will allow these newly-graduates to develop their career in the right fields and secure the leading role of United States in science and technology in the world.
