I cannot believe this would be considered. 
From a Freedom of information act request: "OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds."
Why does this make sense to anybody? It makes companies not want to hire Americans and is discriminatory to people over 35 years of age in technical roles. They abuse the H1-B visas to hire cheap labor.
This needs to be reconsidered
