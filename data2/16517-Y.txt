I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I'm an international Computer Science Phd student from China. Before coming to US, I had several options to purse my degree. One of the most important reason that I chose to study in US is that US promises to provide more practical and industrial experience. OPT extension is the most valuable treasurer to attract international students. We spent a lot of time and money to get the chance of attending program in US. If we can only directly go back home country after graduation, we do not have much strength compared to graduates who stay at home country. Then it becomes no sense to pay such to be somewhere invaluable. 

Besides, many projects require long-term to finish. How can a company move on if it cannot hold its employees? The international students are contributing to US companies. The companies would not recruit them for no reason.

I cannot imagine the reason why people do not support the OPT-extension.
