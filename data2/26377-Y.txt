United States is a county characterized by her Openness and Diversity, and made prosperous by them. We should be careful not to stir up narrow-minded, extreme xenophobia on this issue.

Apparently, small proportion of citizens prefer STEM results in shortage of qualified candidates in talent market. It's absurd to think F-1 students "steal" the jobs because the jobs can't be filled by domestic students anyway. If international students can't secure H1B jobs after completing their education in US. They are more likely to go back to their original county. Think about Elon Musk, a South African-born Canadian studying physics and economics in United States. Without a decent length of OPT and the right to work in United States, SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity and Hyperloop will be jokes. Or probably, they are going to be happened in the other counties. Entrepreneurship in High-tech industry in United States will suffer.

I urge all of us to put national interest in mind when commenting on this important issue.
