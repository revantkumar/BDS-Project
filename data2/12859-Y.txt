I strongly support this new rule. Most of stem students are highly-skilled employee at information industry. 

Some local folks might be afraid of
1. losing job opportunities
2. let the employer lower the standard salary since foreign employee request lower compensation

Actually, these are not totally truth.

1. The foreign STEM students are only occupy a small space in human-resource market. Yes, they compete with local folks. But they are not more competitive compared with local folks with the same-level skill. According to survey attached in the article, most of STEM students devote them into high-tech industry. It reflects two annotation: they are most intelligent brains all over the world, and the number of them are really small. Moreover, in a long term, a strong industry(benefited from highly-skilled workers) can generate more job opportunities.

2. The company pays a lot of money for their foreign employee. In other word, local folks are "cheaper". Hiring people needs money. H1B needs money. Green Card needs money. The company pays more for a legal foreign employee.

So what about the benefits of the rule?
1. US can attract more brilliant youth to benefit its own industry.
2. Industry can cut down the risk of losing employee(since then foreign employee is more possible to get H1B visa ).
3. Foreign employee are less stressful for their visa status.

To conclude, new rule can benefit employer, empolyee and the whole country. That's why I support this new rule.
