I oppose the Dept. of Homeland Security expanding the Optional Practical Training Program. With millions of U.S. citizens out of work, it makes no sense to expand the advantage foreign workers have over our own citizens. By not having to pay payroll taxes on the OPT workers, employers will prefer foreign workers over American workers. If DHS wants to change the OPT program, they should reduce the time foreign tech students get to find full time work. If the administration wants the law changed, they need to go to congress, not randomly create more regulations to hurt American workers..
