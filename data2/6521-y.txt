Simon Huang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. As far as I know, many international students got their master/PHD degree from United States, which further help the country grow and prosper. Without the STEM extension, they may not live and help build the nation and this is a great lost of United States.

2. Competition does exist but it's still a good way for the nation to progress. One may claim that international students who use OPT to work in US will make other people unemployed, especially those who are native Americans. IMO, international students can work without affecting other people's employment, and even create more job opportunities. They focus more on technology and science, which is a great way to make our society be more productive, and more people can benefit and enjoy the high-tech life.

3. Diversity is a good factor to American society, and it helps to build the nation since different culture and customs can merge and communicate.
