There seems to be some kind of conspiracy in the USA to undermine the lives of CITIZENS who need jobs. 

We have allowed one million people to come here every year for a better lives and have absorbed into the workforce other millions, at an ever increasing rate.

Our own young people deserve better chances at first-rate jobs. 

We are tired of companies, like Disney, forcing about to be "laid off" employees have to have to train foreign H-1B workers who will be doing those jobs at less pay. These are family people, who are being ditched -- not because they were slackers, but because the company wants to have a smaller payroll. 

Surely, you can see what this is doing to our country...

Our country has been very benevolent to the whole world, sending goods and services abroad. 

And we have taken in all kinds of people -- in more ways than one. 

But, this has got to stop -- we need at least a temporary moratorium for us to get right-side-up.

Furthermore, many do not have the same values that we have, the same moral fortitude, the same patriotism, love and respect for human life and the willingness to become true Americans.

Please take this into serious consideration.
