Since when international students stealing jobs from American citizens? It's a free country, isn't it?
As an international master degree graduate, I have the skills to perform what my job requires me, which is not stealing jobs from American citizens.

I here for the extension of OPT that it allows me a longer time during which I can make profits for the company, bring benefits to USA, further benefit the American society.

Thanks.
