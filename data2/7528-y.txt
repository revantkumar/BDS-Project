Ying Zhang Thanks for the new proposal and I strongly support it! U.S. is an immigration country and should encourage equal rights to work and compete. Foreign workers help in the growth of this country, and contribute to tax income which benefit all citizens. And OPT program provides excellent opportunity for students to gain work experience, whether they will stay in U.S. or go to home country.
