Xinru Qiu To whom it may concern,

I support the 24-months extension OPT stem program proposal.
I believe the practical training is a key element for F-1 students educational experience, also all the F-1 students pay taxes according to the law. 
Also, the OPT will not affect the working positions for the U.S citizens, while I was having my graduate study, the proportion was one citizen out of ten international students in my department.

Sincerely,
Xinru
