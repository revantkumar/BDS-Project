Excuse me......we have thousands of Americans out of work and now you want to give immigrants jobs that Americans are doing. Disney is going along with this and we will boycott Disney from now on! We will find other places to go that do not practice this rule. 
Illegals are being given government hand outs.....what about our Veterans.....they are not getting the care that the need. Getting to see a doctor takes too long and many of them die. Shame on our government. Obama is only interested in doing everything that he can for the Muslims.....what about people that were born in this country. 
We the People are fed up with all of his Executive Orders and Executive Memorandums. Hopefully, we can elect someone in 2016 that cares about America. Obama has shown over and over that he does not. 
There is no difference between the Republicans and the Democrats. They go along with whatever Obama wants perhaps they were threatened or bought off. 
What has happened in our country....we were once a strong nation....not anymore.
