STEM students from other countries should be given the chance to extend the length of their OPT period. They are not a threat for U.S. citizens or residents. International STEM students just want to use this time to gain more experience. From the perspective of employers in the U.S., STEM students can help them with their businesses, which in turn helps the U.S. economy. There are a great amount of high-tech companies and other companies that need people from the STEM area to work for them. And international STEM students have made a huge contribution to it. After the start of OPT extension in 2008, the new policy has attracted more international students majoring in related fields to come and study the in U.S., which means once the policy stops, less people with talents in STEM fields would come and make their contributions. The world is full of competitions, the stronger are always the ones that win. If international STEM students are taking spots from natives, then natives should try to make themselves more competent. 

U.S. is the land of immigrants. It is the most diverse country in the world. All people have the right to fight for their stay in the U.S. if they want as long as following the legal procedures. STEM Extension is an incentive and win-win policy for both America and STEM students. It should not be terminated.
