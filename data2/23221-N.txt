This is the most moronic thing I've heard of . Taking jobs away from Americans and bringing in more foreigners is a tragedy toward the American worker and I don't want to hear that they are jobs Americans don't want to do Get rid of the welfare state and Americans will do any job rather than starve It is time for tough love and it's obvious this President doesn't have the stomach for it and It's changing this country into a 7th century moslem state Soon no one will want to work and we will have a Dictatorship
