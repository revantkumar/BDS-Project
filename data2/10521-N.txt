I am one of the 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree. I have an MSEE from Boston University and 20 years work experience. By turning the F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas, DHS is doing an end run around Congressional limits on H-1b 3-year work visas. That displaces and replaces ever more employed citizens with non-citizens living on their employer's "visa leash" and working for 1/2 to 2/3 of the standard pay for their field.
