Madhur Garg The rule proposed surely benefits the US economy and keeps the American dream alive for students who worked really hard. USA is the only country in the world which treats everyone equally. I am an aggie and proud to be a graduate from Texas A&M. I always get goosebumps when aggies scores a touchdown and don't want to talk anyone for couple if we loose. I am passionate about A&M and my work because of the wonderful people here, I hope everyone understands that we part o fthe community and will tr to do great things for this wonderful country.

It's a wonderful rule proposed by the government and truly support it.
