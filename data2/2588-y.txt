Yuzhu Shi I just graduated two months ago, major in food safety and technology, master. We, the F1 visa students, need more time to work. 

We are wonder why US government so care about our time to work in U.S. We did no cheat on finding job, we even more harder than the native to work here We pay money ourselves, hunt job very urgent, we did no cheat on finding jobs. Compare with native we are even more disadvantages and not equally treated. 

We, foreign people, are indeed do much progress on IT, engineering, and technology area of US. 

U.S is original a immigrate country. Those people who don't want immigrate, themselves are immigrate. But, they still love this country, and did much progress on this country. So, why they refuse us.
