I support this rule for several reasons as follows:
1. This rule give us a sense that the US has a spirit of freedom and equality. At the same tine, the excellent students who studied in US need more chance to feedback the society after graduation;
2. In the fact, those talented student including lots of genius who will devote all themselves to the work and may have a great impact on the economy;
3.It's a good rule for US education system and economy system since longer OPT will attract more genius students to study in US, and will bring lots of benefit to the US society.
