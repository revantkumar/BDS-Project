Vignesh Sundar, Arizona State University I would like to support the plan of extending the F1 OPT STEM extension from 17 months to 24 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness.
