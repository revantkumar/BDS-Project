Annabelle Travis I strongly support the proposal that allow F1 students with STEM degree extend OPT by 24 months. Since large amount of workers are need in the fast developing technology field, and native students are not enough. Allowing F1 non-immigrant students work 24 months more with OPT can largely make up the engineer shortage, and helps the development of science and technology.
