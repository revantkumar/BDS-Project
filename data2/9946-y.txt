Anonymous Anonymous I don not really understand why expanding the OPT time for F-1 non immigrant students can hurt American employment market. The basic is with OPT expanding, the international business marketing will be bigger and the international business communication will be more easier.While training these non immigrant student, the United State are actually educating and teaching the potential resources for the international business. Think about that, these students will go back to their homes and countries and do what? They will DO the business with the United State, which definitely helps the American employment market. It is the long term goal for the United State.
