I was a graduated student benefited from the OPT-STEM. I think it is a very good improvement with the new rules. Both F1 students and the United States can be benefited with the new proposal. 

1. High performance F-1 students will contribute more on science in the USA. 
2. The USA could select much more and better F-1 students during the OPT period and never miss a potential talent.
