I have read some comments object to international student OPT extension. Some of them barely attacking immigrants, that's really shock me. I've been live and work in US for more than 10 years, I see laborious foreign people create enormous value every year in silicon valley. I often rejoice about the time we live, people from every where in the world work together to create human's future. And this could just happened in US since no other country could be more tolerant and open than us. People come to make their own dream come true, and we protect their right of work. This is why people with higher education would willing come and work in US. They don't just benefit their own life but benefit all people in US. They invent new technologies, create value for industry company, and the economy growth provide more job opportunities. This is a positive cycle. For those who think immigrant take your job, I just want to tell you to be stronger, keep learning new, if immigrants directly threaten you livelihood, you may also replaced by local people after expel foreign people, even worse.
