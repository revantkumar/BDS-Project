Jeffery Brooke America does not have the resources to hand out jobs to foreigners, we simply cannot effectively help others when we are not taking care of ourselves. Its kind of like America is standing on a bomb that will explode in two minutes, but we ignore disarming that bomb because we are trying to disarm a bomb stuck to a foreigner that will explode in five minutes. Everyone loses, unfortunately there are several idiots holding office that are too stupid to grasp such a simple concept, or they just figure; Hell, I'll be dead before any real consequences come around, they have their cushy job and they just don't care. It just isn't convenient at the time and they certainly don't want to be targeted as a racist. Never-mind it hasn't a damn thing to do with racism and everything to do with simple math. A bit of advice for those who swore to uphold our constitution and laws, grow some balls and call it what it is, silence those who refuse to see things for what they actually are.
