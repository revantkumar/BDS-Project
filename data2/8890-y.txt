Alok Shrestha I believe 24 months OPT extension should be given to the eligible international students. Being a land of opportunity almost all of the international students come to the USA hoping to get the best education and practical experience in the world. Most of them sacrifice their time, money and even family and work hard than ever to get the US degree and get the real world exposure. If one just get the degree and have to get back to their own country, there is just no use of having degree after spending thousands of dollars of parents money or even loan money to spend on US degree.
