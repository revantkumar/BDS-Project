One of the most important reasons that I choose to study in the US not other countries is because of more than 1 year of OPT for students that can improve their skills and knowledge in a professional environment, ie working. If the OPT only has one year, the attraction of studying in the US will be dramatically declined. Instead of paying high tuitions here in the US, we international students can have better choices in other countries. So it is very important to extend OPT to keep attracting excellent students to come to the US.

Also, for US companies who want to expand their markets in other countries, they do in great need of students from those countries to provide their market knowledge of their own countries. With 24 months of OPT, international students are more willing to stay here to contribute those companies and boost American economy. This is very beneficial to American companies if international students have 24 months of OPT.

As a stem student, I do hope that OPT extension will get approved and make this win-win situation happen for US universities, companies and international students.
