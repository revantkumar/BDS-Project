Alden Moore I strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. The reason is as follows:

1. Doing so will make United States more competitive in the world. As we all know, STEM students are the next generation scientists and engineers. These STEM students will be responsible for next-generation medicine, future computing technology, invention of new materials, etc.. If we cannot provide job opportunities for these students after we spent so much money training them, they will go to other countries and serve them. This is clearly against the interest of United States.

2. Doing so will boost US economy. Today, many 'technology companies' are in huge demand of STEM students. These companies contribute significantly to the domestic economy. In fact, it is not just 'technology companies', but really, all companies, since all companies today need technology professionals, i.e., today's STEM students.

3. Doing so is simply the right 'American' way. Providing more opportunities for STEM students will promote the idea of 'american dreams', and encourage people from all countries to work hard for the country. A fraction of the STEM students will be nationalized in the future. This will not only benefit the country, but also will improve the diversity of the country.

Therefore, I strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degree and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.
