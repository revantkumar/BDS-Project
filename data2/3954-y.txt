Mia Liu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
2. The government will get more taxes if international students worked longer. The increased taxes will help to pay pension.
