I have just spent $150,000 to put my son thru engineering school at Ohio State University. The OPT program has the capacity to entice employers to hire non-residents thru the savings from non-payment of Social Security taxes, which saves them 7.65% and the employee needs 7.65% less wages as they don't pay in either.

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
