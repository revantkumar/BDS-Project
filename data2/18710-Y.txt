I strongly support for the longer OPT for following reasons:
1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation, which is also good for the development of US. 
2. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US and bring more diversity to this nation of freedom.
