I strongly support this policy because STEM students are highly required in US especially for computer sciences and mathematics. With the development, this field will need more and more top technical staffs, the 24 months extension can give the international students who have talent skill in this part more opportunities to work in US, I think this is benefit for both two parts, if the STEM students just have 12 months OPT, I think some companies such as Google, or Microsoft will lost lots of excellent people.
