I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. It provides new graduates with industry training opportunity, thus very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Besides, if this rule is terminated by whatever reason, it's definitely a huge disaster for most US high-tech companies such as Google, Apple, Intel, FB, since they are supported by STEM talents.
