The new proposal that allows international students, especially those with STEM degrees, to work after graduation will benefit the United States in many ways. Students with STEM degrees are the skilled, technology-oriented labor force, which is crucial for the steady growth of US economy. Fields of STEM are the future, if not current, arena of international competition. And the US is the home to the world's best institutions of higher education that train such talents. If we can't keep them to work for the US, they will work for other countries and compete with us in the future. 

In addition to those economic benefits, the more obvious reason for the government to pass this proposal is that it fits the Amercian value and tradition of welcoming immigrants and refugees. Depriving students of such pos-graduate training opportunity is incongruous with spirits that make America great.

I hope the government will consider the voice of both sides, and keep the American dream alive.
