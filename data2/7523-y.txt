Ji Li I strongly support the OPT extension program. This program provides fresh blood to many levels of a profession. When I study CS in graduate school, more than 2/3 of the students are international students. And half of them have work experience from their own countries. When those with years of experience graduate, they can find junior or even senior level positions, since there is a continuously increasing need of experienced workers in IT industry. Their experience can be so important as American companies can learn new ideas of business model, product design, development process and so on. Those ideas are usually come from success stories from other countries.
