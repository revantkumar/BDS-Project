To my concern, I absolutely support this proposal. This is not only about international students like me, but also is about this great country.

First of all, this proposal would definitely contribute to the whole country, as all international students, who come across the sea and get professional education, could continue devoting themselves to the people , the society and the country. It is obvious that their knowledge and intellect accelerates the world development. 

Secondly, some people might say international students have taken away their own opportunity, which I disagree. In general, the history of immigrant, including white Anglo-Saxon protestant, Ashkenazi, Asian, African, Hispanics and Latinos and so on, witnessed how United States becoming a great country. The diversity of America is always what people admire for. How could those people who say no to this proposal abandon the most important spirit of this country? Think about it, without people from all over the world, how could America win the second world war? 

Plus, international students who get jobs could already explain the thing, which means the society needs his ability to make more contribution and profit. The company and the society knows who is the person they want. What I see is everyone is equally treated, this is why people love this country. 

Again, I strongly support this proposal. God bless the America.
