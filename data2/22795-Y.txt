I would like to support this proposal. 

I'm currently studying in Master program of Quantitative Economics at Tufts University. I appreciate the efforts offered by the department to train us to be competitive in our field. Half of the students are coming from countries other than the U.S. Most of us received scholarship from the department to come to study. Thus, with all the resources and supports this country provided, I feel the extension proposal would benefit the U.S if we could have longer opportunity to work here after graduation.

To be more precise, we could contribute our skills and efforts to whoever needs in our area of study. Compared to the old time duration, two years will be a more serious and higher quality input in order to have productive results for both employers and us. 

Also, it's not conflicted with reducing job opportunity for local people since its not a timeless working permission. As a student of economics, what I have in mind is instead to help analysing and creating better and more opportunity for the people here. I feel excited about this possible chance to applying my knowledge into practice use. 

To conclude, extension of OPT is a nice proposal even if I think for the interest of the U.S. Thanks for reading my comments.
