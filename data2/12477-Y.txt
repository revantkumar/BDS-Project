Expanding Training Opportunities is a critical way to retain elites in the U.S. It give skilled international students more time to find suitable jobs in the US, and US companies can take the time to find more suitable employees among international students.

I actually don't get why the extension would harm US citizens' employment. The extension gives international students more time to find suitable jobs, but it doesn't mean that US companies would hire international students just because the extension. I mean, companies are looking for the most suitable students, not the most suitable international students. The most suitable students can be either US students or international students.
