I say NO to OPT program as this program do not provide relief to the F1 Students. F1 Students are hired on OPT by the companies and they do not want to hire them on work visa because of OPT program available. So this program is a big time bad deal for everybody - it is a bad deal for F1 students who want to fair paychecks(but on OPT they earn way less than what they would on work visa). And it is a bad deal for American skilled workers and fresh graduates - Why would companies hire Americans and skilled workers if they can hire F1 students on OPT program and save so much in taxes and paychecks?
