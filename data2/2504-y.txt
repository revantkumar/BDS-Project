Mubin Wang Expanding Training Opportunities is beneficial for both international students and United States. United States attract top-tier students from all around the world, because it has the best academic sector and provides promising work opportunities. If the training opportunities are cut off, there will be much less students willing to come to U.S. to pursue degrees at a rather high cost. In the other way around, this will decrease the competitiveness of U.S. academic sector. 

I don't think STEM students will compete with U.S. citizens in terms of jobs. STEM students are mostly recruited by international, high-tech companies. U.S. is the leader in high-tech industries because it attracts the talents. What STEM students do is help those companies expand globally and win competitions. More jobs will be created and U.S. economy will continue to grow. If most students are forced to leave U.S. after their studies, that would be a such a waste -- using so much resource educating good engineers, and then send them to Europe, Japan, China, India, etc.?

Most importantly, expanding OPT concords with the very fundamental spirit of U.S. This country is so successful due to its diversity and fairness to all groups. STEM students should be welcomed to stay longer, because they will definitely be a part of building the greatness of U.S.
