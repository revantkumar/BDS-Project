I strongly support OPT extension policy. A good government never rejects potential people who can benefit its country in lots of ways. I am a Chinese and Chinese government is trying its best to help foreigners survive in China. I think America should do this, too. Some Americans say it may make them lose their jobs, but that's definitely not true. Lots of companies in America are owned by Chinese, which provide many a job opportunity for Americans. People from different countries have different expertise and working as a team will maximize the profits. Rejecting people because they are intelligent is no different from monopoly and stop the country from growing stronger and faster. In a word, OPT extension will make the talented F-1 students' life easier and boot America's economy and make America a much better country with no doubt.
