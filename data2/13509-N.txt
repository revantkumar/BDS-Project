This rule will be detrimental to American workers who live, work, pay taxes in their own country. The proposal to allow out of country workers, who have to be trained on these jobs, is nothing but political force. Not acceptable to ordinary Americans.DHS should not be involved in this decision. This is Congressional territory.
