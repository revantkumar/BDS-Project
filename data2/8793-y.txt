Maggie Pepper We have Americans in need of jobs, we have Veterans in need of jobs, we have families that need two people working due to the liberal mentality in Washington D.C. Stop this insanity. There should be no immigration until all Americans have jobs and the Immigration laws on the books are enforced. First get rid of illegal criminals, then start on illegals themselves, deportation should start immediately, empty the prisons of illegals and send them back to their native country. We do not want your New World Order.
