I think this is a great proposal. Stem students did bring a lot of vitality to the tech companies and other industries. I am an engineer working in a tech company. I have two engineers from India and one from China in our team. They did great jobs and they contributed a lot to the company.

Also as far as I know, a longer opt would attract more international students to US which will help us attract more talents and smart people. I saw some opposite comments saying international students would take our jobs and use our resources. But as for my understanding, all students qualify an opt at least get a BS and many are masters. It would be a great loss for US to loose them.
