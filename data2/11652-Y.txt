I strongly agree with extend OPT. Extending OPT of STEM major students will not taking over citizens' jobs, it will bring a lot of elites of different area and all of them will contribute to the United States. Since the increasing demand of employees of these majors, the US citizens are not enough for this high demand. That is the reason why the United States really need those international students. Moreover, the development of technical companies and the effort of international students with STEM majors are strongly related. As these companies developing, it will provide more and more job opportunities for the US citizen.
