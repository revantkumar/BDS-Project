I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. universities. Many famous scientist are the international students before they make great achievement. 

3. Competition dose exist, but not bad thing. Many international student they choice career field like: IT industry. which is no popular for U.S. citizens.
