I strongly agree with the idea of OPT extension. It creates benefits for both American and international people. American are able to get more labors in this way and be more competitive in the aspect of economy since talented workers are able to stay longer. Moreover, more people means higher GDP. Government are going to be richer because of the policy. And it provides students with more chances, which implies that more international students would choose American Universities for the increased opportunity. For international people, OPT extension is also beneficial since they would have more time for chasing American Dream. All in all, I really agree with the extension of OPT.
