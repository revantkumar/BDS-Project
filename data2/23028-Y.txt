I am voting in favor of this proposed rule based on the following reasons. 

First, this rule will help the growth of US economy. As we all know, a country's economy is pumped by high-tech companies, such as Google and Amazon. With this rule approved, more qualified workers are available to these companies. If these high-tech companies are not doing well, US, as a whole, will lose competition in the world market, sooner or later. The well-being of these high-tech companies not only create many jobs themselves, but also benefit to companies in other industries, such as real estate companies, food providers and so on. Then more and more jobs are available for US citizens in non-STEM major too. 

Second, a lot of excellent technical leaders and entrepreneurs come out of the group of people who took advantage of OPT. These people bring enormous values to the country. For example, they founded companies to high more citizens. Nowadays there are more and more people on the waiting list for a H1B visa. If these excellent people cannot stay and contribute at US, it would be a huge loss to the country. In fact, looking back in the history, US has always been very good at attracting excellent people to work for it. In another words, if these excellent people go to companies in other countries, they can become potential competitors of US companies. 

Last, it is shortsighted to blame foreigners for "stealing" US citizens' jobs. The long-term benefit of US economy replies on good workers in good companies. Workers on OPT status are a large part of working force in many good companies. Companies know how to choose the best workers in order to grow their business in high-tech fields. They should not be charity organizations that hire unqualified workers. 

In summary, for the benefit of the US economy and all citizens in the long run, extending OPT for STEM students, and even increasing H1B visa quota, should be approved.
