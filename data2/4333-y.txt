sagar rankhambe I will support the STEM extension as this will not only help international student to get some good International experience but this will help more to THE USA to improve in lot of areas like technology, financially, scientifically. If this STEM extension is cancelled and it become 12 months then that will drastically affect the Educational systems in USA because International student pay Out off state fees which is like almost 3 times that what in state student pays... And if STEM extension is canceled then lot of international student will not choose to come to USA for higher studies which will eventually affect the financial conditions of UNIVERSITIES and the Universities which are getting lot of revenues or money from these international students will stop. At the end I just want say that USA gov. should not target incoming talent to their country because The only way to get better and more financially strong for any country is depend on how much youth talent that country have.
