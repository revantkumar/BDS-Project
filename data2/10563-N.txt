The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help THEIR home countries when they returned. Today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to STAY in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. Jobs to Americans FIRST!
