Science and Technology jobs and training should always be first offered to US citizens and legal residents. We have to take care of our own unemployment and under-employment problems before giving valuable jobs away to residents of other countries. Residents of other countries should take their valuable US degrees back to their own countries and improve the Science and Technology systems there, where they are needed.
