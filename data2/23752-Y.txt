U.S. is leading the whole world in technology and innovation and lots of immigrants with expertise contribute a huge part. The OPT extension program provides a lot of talents more time to stay with their current work which is part of economy boost. The program also helps U.S. government to filter immigrant applicants, find out those the country needs most and let them stay in the country. 
An overall better economy environment will benefit everyone in the country. 
These days, we are also seeing some CEOs give away their own stock shares to stimulate employees, as they believe with a much more successful company (which needs everyone's input and hard work), the stock shares left will worth much more. 
You have to give something if you expect a return.
