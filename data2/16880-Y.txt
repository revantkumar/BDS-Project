I strongly support this regulation. Why we cannot provide international students the opportunity to work. They are skilled students.. With decent education, most of them could be qualified to work here. And for the people who is going to have opt extension, we have programs called E-verify to measure the company. So we could guarantee that they are treated equal in this company. Will wish keep this and attract more talents to US.
