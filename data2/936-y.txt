Patrick Underwood As an admission officer in a university, I strongly support OPT 24-month STEM extension. Hundreds of thousands foreign students won't come to US for education if this rule doesn't pass through. It will be a great loss for US economy. Plus, after graduation, STEM students can make great contributions to the prosperity of US economy. More jobs will be generated with direct contribution from foreign STEM students. It's a win-win for US long term economy and students who seeking to stay in the US.
