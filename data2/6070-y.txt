Jie Li I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is a good length for OPT program. During my work at IBM, many projects lasted more than 2 years and one project which I involved lasted almost 3 years. I can strongly feel how important experience engineers were to the project. They knew the project well and could give accurate suggestions when we met problems, which kept the project run well. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion,which may delay the project and has an adverse impact on the company.

Further more, US employers will benefit from the background of the foreign students. For example, many big companies such as uber, google wish to enter foreign market. As well all know, foreign countries have different culture, economy. So in order to extend their businesses. those companies may need to make some adjustments. Hence those foreign students become more important because they know their motherland well and can provide useful information and suggestions. If the OPT extension time is too short, many foreign students may choose to go back to their motherlands after graduation, which is harmful to the US high-tech companies,especially those who want to expend their global markets.

besides the benefit which new OPT rules bring to the US high-tech industry, international students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.
