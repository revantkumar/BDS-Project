I strongly support the OPT exstention. 

First of all, international students are one of the important reasons that why many high tech companys make great profits since 21st century, which also help promote the growth of economy of United States. 

Secondly, OPT is an important policy to help United States attract more talented people from all over the world. More talented people make United States more competitive. It is ture that it makes native Americans feel more pressure, but this is the only way that makes native Americans work harder to keep competitive.There is no excuse for being lazy.

What's more important, those international students who want to immigrate to United States needs OPT to stay here in order to further make contribution to United States. If they are unfortunately not selected for the H1B visa, they will lose the chance to join USA and USA also lose an potential excellent immigration. 

We always say that United States are the paradise for immigrations. I think this is one of the reason that why United States has an advantage over other country.
