United States is a country for freedom and equality. But because of the limitation of H1B Cap, eligible students have to be selected through lottery. It is unfair for the students who had "bad luck". Also, for the company, it is a big loss since they spend so much time and effort to train and foster a good employee. However, the 24-month extension, instead of 17-month, would be a good way to lighten this impact since excellent students may have extra 1 more chance to be selected so that they can work and contribute in the United States.
