Fred Melton Personally I don't think there any job beneath me, if me or my family is Hungary, my obligation to the people I owe is behind or I don't I have a place to live. With that in mind we should not give work visa to anyone as long as we have able body citizens on welfare. As the lady at the welfare office told my mother after 2 checks in spring of 1954. Mrs............. The farmers are putting the crops in, you need to find a job. So put some college grad who can't get a job in his field to work cutting grass or digging ditches.
