I strongly support this proposal for several reasons

1. I know many students from Indian has strong ability in research work and they would like take responsibility when having some tasks. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the US.

2. America needs more international students to improve diversity. International students grow up in different culture can bring new and creative ideas in working environment. This kind of diversity helps America become stronger in innovation and technology area. And I believe the innovation will boost the development of economy which benefits every American.

3. Competition do exists, but I don't think it is a bad thing. If there is no competition, people will lose the motivation to make a difference. In the long run, it is not good to the development of US. Rejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students.

Thus, I definitely support this proposal.
