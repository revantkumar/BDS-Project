Argument for Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students
This creates jobs for the American Job markets, please refers to http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/immigration-reform-and-job-growth. F-1 students, who are applying for STEM extension, are people who are supporting competitive enterprises in the States, and are taxed.
Applicants who are eligible for OPT, are high-degrees employees. They are the long-term competitive source of the states, please refer to the Roosevelt/Regan's reform which introduce the act/policy to build the foundation and infrastructure, which lays the foundation of prosperity of the states today.
Short-term vision of not welcoming talents, is making the united states, to become the irrelevant and no longer leader in the world.
