I am working as a research assistant in a lab. Our projects usually lasts 2-4 years. When we hire new employee, we would really like them to finish their assigned projects since training new hires costs time and money. So I strongly support this STEM OPT extension. With that, at least we can stop worrying about new hire quitting jobs due to visa problems as well as don't have to worry about supporting their working visa.
