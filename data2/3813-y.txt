Alex Williams I am glad to support this rule. I'm working in Silicon Valley and have witnessed numerous international students struggling to find a job here. I can see it's not that easy for them to find a job comparing to the native students. Normally, the international students have to make more efforts on job hunting since almost all companies have preferences upon hiring citizens workers, therefore they need to study harder at school and work harder at the workplace. Yes, I think it's a good thing if we look at it from a positive perspective that national economic growth relies on those harding working and ambitous people and competition also brings progress. As an American citizen, I am happy to see our nation always stands the top leadship in the Sciences and Technology fields. So, come on! Let's surpport this role with our pleasure!
