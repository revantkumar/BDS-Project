I support this ruling with no spared effort. Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students would be beneficial for USA in keeping its competitive power. More specifically:

1. It's good for US creative power to have and keep foreign talents for longer time. The ideas and productivity generated will have long-lasting positive influence for the nation's sustainable groth.

2. It is wise for US gain the outcome for its world-class education after spending significant amount of resources in training the foreign talents. Sending them home will be a waste.

3. More foreign talents would be attracted to US if they see a more welcome training opportunities for F-1 students.
