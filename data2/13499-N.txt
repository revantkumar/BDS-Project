OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.

You do not enforce the rules for the H-1B visas program which is killing jobs for "American" students. Why should you get another "loop hole" with rules that you will not enforce. Americans should and must have first priority for educations and jobs in America. Start doing your job and quit screwing over Americans trying to get ahead in their own country.
