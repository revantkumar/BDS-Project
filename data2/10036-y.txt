Eric Gentry As a STEM scientist who has worked with international STEM students at US universities, I am strongly in support of increasing the duration of the STEM OPT extensions. 

I am currently a PhD student, but these changes most directly impact the students I met as an undergraduate at MIT (class of 2014). During my time at MIT, I worked with many international students; 10% of the undergraduates are international. Many of these international students are excellent scientists and engineers. A few of them are the best scientists and engineers in their fields, and for the past year they have been working in the United States, contributing to our economy. The skills these individuals offer are valuable to the United States, and their expertise cannot be replaced.

In the near future, many of these recent graduates, valuable STEM workers, will be strongly affected by the state of the STEM OPT extension. These recent graduates wish to contribute to the US economy, and they are often the most capable scientists and engineers in their field. To not increase the STEM OPT extension would be to turn down an unparalleled resource.
