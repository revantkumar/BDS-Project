I am incensed that my government would even consider using the OPT program to encourage the hiring of foreign STEM students OVER American STEM students!

I also understand that these foreign STEM students were financed by the money I've paid into Social Security and Medicare over the entire course of my working life!! Considering that I will NOT receive any cost of living increase in my SS check further adds more fuel to an already hellish fire. I won't stand for this!!

A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
