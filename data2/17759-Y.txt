I was laid off due to 2008 crisis right 4 months after my first job. Without OPT extension, I am not sure my second company would give me an offer because there would be a gap between my last day of regular OPT and the H1B effective date in the year assuming I can get my H1B. I think the OPT is critical for F-1 students. Please help to make them better, at least not worse than what we have now.
