As a STEM student studying in America now, I cherish every opportunity to learn and accumulate experience. Compared with other countries, I, as an international student come here, rather than other countries because I know higher education in America is more advanced. Thanks to the OPT policy, I also can practice my knowledge in the industries. I think most of international talents help innovate the technologies and benefit the growth of economy. Everyone need chances to show their talent and contribution. I believe America is friendly to everyone. I do not hope any one always treats us as foreigners. To be honest, international students appreciate the education and life here more.
