Ray Hu I strongly support this proposed rule due to the following reason:
1. US has to keep these talented people to remain competitive in the world. 
2. The employers are not stupid. They will hire American candidates given all equal. So it's not reasonable to say these talented foreigners take Americans' jobs.
3. To keep these talented people will actually boost US economy and create more jobs, which will benefit US in the long run for sure.
