Cathy Bennett I strongly oppose the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand. 
The proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.

The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'"

The OPT program expands the pool of YOUNG workers and this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers. Not only will this program artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers). And because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.

And finally the most important issue is to ensure that no U.S. worker is in any way adversely impacted by these types of programs.
