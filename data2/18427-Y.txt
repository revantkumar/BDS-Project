It is really unfair to deprive international students's legal right to work in US after graduation just because to save jobs for US citizens. 
Firstly, the jobs international students apply for are highly technical ones that are critical for this country, such as science and technology. Can you even imagine what Silicon Vally would be without the contribution of international students? Those fields need international students because there are just not enough US citizens that are qualified for those jobs. International students are not cheap labors. Many of them founded their own companies and created jobs for citizens.

Secondly, think about the tuition international students paid each year to US for getting a bachelor or master degrees, more than 100,000 for each person. Moreover, International students pay rents to landlords who are citizens, pay taxes to US governments, and the beneficiaries are US citizens. They've invested so much, and it's unfair not to give them the practice opportunity in US. 

Thirdly, comments that mention international students steal jobs from citizens are wrong. Jobs are not stolen, jobs are earned. International students earned their jobs with great skills and knowledge, and continue to use their knowledge to make contribution to this country.
