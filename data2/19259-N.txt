With the current (real) unemployment rate, it seems to me to be insanity to look outside of our borders for workers wanting jobs. I was replaced once by a worker with an H1B willing to accept 50% if my salary. It took me another 5 years to work back up to that rate. There is nothing resembling "representative government" today when foreigners are given preference over Americans for employment.
