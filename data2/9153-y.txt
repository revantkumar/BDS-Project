Michael Jones Why is it that our government and it's agencies think that foreign workers are better? I mean is it just me or does it feel like everywhere you look our government is trying to hurt the American people in one form or fashion I know people who are telling their kids not to go to college because of the cost and that when they are finished with school they won't be able to get a job in their field because of foreign workers and if they do get a job it will be at Wal-Mart or fast food so I'm wondering what we are going to do they already pay people not to grow crops here in America so they can buy it from other countries so now we are going to buy people to work from other countries and before you know it pay for their kids to go to college here when did our government lose faith in the American people?
