Hi
I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE
Because i believe that The United States of America is a place which gives opportunities for many international students to pursue masters degree and provide OPT which is to implement their theory course practically and gain real time experience. Extending OPT STEM extension to 24 months is really a great step which will helps all the international students by giving time to explore technical aspects and obtain required skills with this extension.This is a great advantage for students and companies in USA. i am grateful that i can get more practical knowledge with this extension which will helps me to give the best to my company and nation.

Really looking forward for this ruleto come in to action as soon as possible.
