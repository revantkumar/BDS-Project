I strongly agree with the extending timeline of OPT. I think the most appealing part of American High level education lies in OPT. It offers students more time to enhance what they already learnt. Considering the nature part of search, I really doubt any search will get result in limited OPT time. Just considering how much time it will take when you doing research on science field. I was taking cloud computing course last semester and dealing with big data. Frankly speaking, it takes about one week just gathering data from one point and deal with them. You can imagine how many fields you have to gather in total. Also, it's impossible to switch to another person to finish the task, it's costly and wasting much more time.

STEM work force belongs to higher-salary part. Their consumption contribute much more than average population.
