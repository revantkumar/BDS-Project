Virginia J. Stgermain I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. International students play a crucial part in American tech companies.Without them,it will be very hard for the tech companies to hire qualified software engineers.It will be a disaster for the U.S. economy if the OPT is canceled since thousands of competent employees will be forced to leave America.
2. International students do not necessarily take jobs from Americans.The contribution they do to the economy will create more jobs for American people.
3. For those wo are concerned that international students won't pay tax and medicare,I will say the worry is unnecessary because there are laws regulating this and the federal government will make sure they do.
