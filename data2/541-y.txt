Jeremy Fang, ASU I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..
2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, Europe is degrading because they are quit against immigrants from other countries. Only by keeping diversity of the country could we make U.S. an energetic country of economy.
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.
