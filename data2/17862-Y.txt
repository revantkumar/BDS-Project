I really welcome the decision taken by DHS. Extending stem opt from 17 months to 24 months is good idea which helps the students effectively use their skills learned in masters. 

If no OPT extension then most of the students who is working currently in many organisation have to leave country which will effect many companies and their projects stops in middle. More than 100,000 students have to leave if no OPT extension.

IF no OPT extension, students will stop choosing US for masters and they may prefer other countries, which leads shutting down of many universities.

Students contribute to growth of US economy by paying taxes when they are employed. 

Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in their field of study

All universities are changing their syllabus based on the new technologies in market. Finding skilled students in latest technology becomes difficult which leads to lack to innovation in US.

STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which helps in improving U.S. economy.

It will make a dent in the student career and resume, if the Cap-Gap is Relief is not retained

Anyhow, if they are selected in H1b, they have to come back and work after 6 months. If this relief is there, it will avoid unnecessary travel and unnecessary lack of continuity in employment.

If US is changing the rule of Stem OPT Extension on temporary basis, then international students will find the other countries beneficial and hence this new rule should be a permanent one and should be implemented before the court deadline of 12 Feb 2016.

The new rule should be implemented by Jan 2016 (before the 12 Feb 2016) deadline by the court.
