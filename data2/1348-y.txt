Sandeep Kumar Gopnaboina As many of International students came for studying by spending lot money by using bank loans in home country,Is to gain good knowledge and to gain money with helping the American economy. When they plan for American visa to come for studying they will be calculating their financial situation and includes the work permit period for F1 student.If at all they are not allowed work here their families will be in trouble and no Indian student has dare to come to united studies with out.
In India we had good valued education in STEM degrees than here which are offered by most of universities But we don't have more opportunities there That is the reason most of Indian students are coming to get an opportunity to work.Please at least try to be old rule for students those who came to United states and please don't change rules frequently because those coming for studies will suffer a lot by changing rules.If at all if Government want to remove STEM extension please let it be applicable for next coming students so that students and family's gets time to decide whether they choose education in US and review their economic capability of handling education in US with Out work permit.
