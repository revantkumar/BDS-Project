Stella Chen I strongly support the 24-month STEM OPT extension. 

First of all, students with STEM extension are not driving down the minimum wage. Jobs that are paid with minimum wages usually do not sponsor OPT and international students can't do these jobs. On the contrary, STEM graduates usually work in large or well established companies with above average pays. At least for all of the international students I'm friends with who are currently working in the U.S are all paid at least 65k a year. They are usually programmers at tech companies, analysts in consulting firms or investment banks. These technical jobs usually don't have enough qualified Americans to fill the spots, so U.S companies need STEM students. 

Second, if STEM students are allowed to work in the U.S for a longer period, more talent will be attracted to the U.S and make contributions to the American economy. Since employers spend a lot of resources on training new employees, if students can stay in the U.S for only a year, a lot of the talent with training and experience will go to other countries. U.S needs the OPT extension to retain the best graduates and maintain the competitive advantage in the world.
