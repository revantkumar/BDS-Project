There is a massive amount of information in the DHS memorandum in support of OPT, but after you sift though it you are faced with the realization that it offers foreign students three years ion which to seek employment after graduation from college. These additional years, in which the foreign students will be protected by the terms of this legislation, operate against the interest of our own home grown student graduates. Why would we want to create legislation that would establish such a gratuitous competitive barrier ?
