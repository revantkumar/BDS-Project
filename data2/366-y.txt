Dylan L I strongly support this proposal.

Immigrants are the foundations of United States of America. H1B are for foreign students, whether or not will these students become US citizens are not important, it provides a chance for these students to pay back to US after they graduate as they have been educated here and have some time (such as 36 months) to get more familiar with this country as well as this country get more familiar with them. And when the day comes, some may leave forever, some may stay to contribute making US a better country. It's like a mutual selection and a double win. US will be able to keep getting top talents from the whole world and become better and better. While some comments suggest foreigners stoled jobs from US citizens, I can't see this possibly be true. Actually, a citizen will only get a job much more easily than a foreign as long as he/ she deserves this job. Competence always exists, the only thing a person can do is to improve himself/ herself. And everyone will learn more this way and benefit from this eventually. America needs such competence to keep great.
