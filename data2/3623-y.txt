Travis R Camargo I really SUPPORT this proposed rule considering the following reasons.
1.Its unfair to blame the fierce competition in the job market on international students.To reduce the pressure of reemployment means economic prosperity bringing more opportunities. Thats the economic policy of the US government and the social economic environment that really matter. Whats more,the international students have contributed a lot which cant be counted to the development of the US in various area,such as IT,software,engineering program and so on.The fact mentioned above tells us that WE AMERICAN CITIZENS can benefit from international students working here, rather than face completely disaster.
2.To dislodge international students from our country seems to be unreasonable,as they are welcomed by US when they applied for American universities and finally should be objected by the US when they finish their education.We can and we should give their more chances when they believe that the US is somewhere that can help them achieve their dreams.My experience makes me know that to have some friends who come from other countries and work with some foreign colleagues is really interesting,as they will always share some unique ideas.
