I strongly support the proposal of extending the OPT extension to 24 months.The high tech companies in American are needing STEM students. I am a master new graduate studying Electrical Engineering and just graduated from school. I am lucky to have the opportunity to work in one of the top companies after graduation. In my field of study, from the lab where I studied to the group where I am working now in my company are almost all Asians. And my major is of critical importance to the quality of the products this company sold all over the world. This major is challenging and not many talents could be found in industry. And so the director came to our university to find talented students.

If the rule is not retained, us students as well as the industry will be seriously impacted. Thousands of talents will have to leave US in a short period of time without having experience of applying what we have studied into practical use. The company will be losing engineers that are highly creative, innovative and productive. And also, the companies will be reluctant to hire OPT students because they feel they may lost their legal status of staying in US soon. But at the same time, their chances of finding US citizens who are skilled in these areas are rare.
