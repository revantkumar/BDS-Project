I strongly support this new proposal because it will benefit the US economy. As we known, US is a nation of immigrants who continuously contribute to it and make it the most powerful one in almost every aspect of the world. It is the relative flexible immigration policy that help US attract talents from all around the world. Therefore, it is very necessary to give international employees more opportunities to work in this country. The new proposal for STEM degrees students servers for this goal and will directly benefits the economy. Under the recent slow growth environment of the world, it actually becomes more and more important to attract talented international students to contribute to this country and help it maintain its status in the world.

Some exaggerate the influence of international students and worry that they will steal more jobs because of this new proposal. However, the reason for fewer jobs is because of the economic environment. Also, the OPT extension can only be applied to a very limited industries and a certain number of E-verified companies. The last thing I want to mention is that it is always the competition between talented employees that push the development of this country. We should not see the BENEFICIAL COMPETITION in the job market as a bad thing in terms of long-term development of this nation!
