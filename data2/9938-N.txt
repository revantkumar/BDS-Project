All U.S. Government Quasi-Regulatory Agencies, (U.S. Congress not withstanding) ) or Executive Branch, changes to U.S. Immigration Laws should be null and void effective the day they were made. (unless approved by the U.S. CONGRESS)
Immigration laws as well as other laws regulated by Government agencies are too important for any ONE person to have the final word regarding them.
Any and all changes to these laws should be changed only by the U.S. Congress. That's the designated body the citizens of the U.S. has designated as our official legislating office.
Any person whether they be non-immigrant, immigrant, illegal immigrant, student, etc. should NOT be allowed any type WORK authorization permit in the U.S. as long as we have even ONE unemployed, able-bodied, American citizen out of work ! This is only fair. Look at other countries. Don't their laws basically say that very same thing in those countries?
Why should the U.S. allow anyone, from anywhere else in the world (who comes here to study and get degrees) be granted permits that allow them to work here when we have our own citizens that are qualified for the same jobs and are out of work?
