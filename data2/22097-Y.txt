I strongly support extending OPT STEM extension to 24 months. 

From a personal perspective, smartest international students in the U.S. often have multiple job offers from around the globe ( home country, U.S., sometimes EU). U.S. offers used to be the best but the capped amount of working visa recently has added uncertainty into working in U.S..Undoubtedly these young talents would add great value to their company wherever they are. Lengthening the OPT program will triple the odds of gaining working visa for a STEM graduate, while increasing H1B cap for U.S. graduates is indeed the essential solution. 

With STEM OPT Extension, US employers will gain more freedom in practice its business in the best way. Losing talents due to limited working visas is a shame to US Economy. A technically skilled workforce is critical to an innovation-driven nation.
