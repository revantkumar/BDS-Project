I completely support the new rule of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I think F-1 OPT STEM extension to 24 Months from 17 months would increase the duration of practical training is important for student to fully utilize the education the received. This is also beneficial for the nation's economic, scientific,technological competitiveness.
