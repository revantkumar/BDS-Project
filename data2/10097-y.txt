Krista Henrickson I support the extension of OPT.

I support to extend OPT to ensure every qualified STEM student who has graduated from US universities to contribute to our country. Why should we send those good people out?

My coworker, Lotanna, graduated from University of Pietersburg and joined our company. She did a great job. She helped us to start a new project on Tropical Marine with her great knowledge in the area. So we got several full time head counts this year and hired several college graduates.

However, she had to stop working because she did not win H1-b lottery and ran out of OPT. It is a great loss for our department.

Please help OPT students like her to get a chance to contribute to our great country.
