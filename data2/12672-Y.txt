I definitely think this new OPT extension will benefit U.S. nation, U.S. citizen and the international students. My opinion is based on the following 2 facts:
1. OPT extension program allows millions of intelligent employees all over the U.S.. These employees create tremendous amount of value to the country.So many business founders and principles in the companies could begin their career because of this OPT extension policy.
2. OPT extension policy attract millions of international students from all over the world. Each student will bring 100 thousands dollars to the US economy. If the OPT policy will be terminated. 
I think the number of international student coming to US will drop significantly. Thousands of American employees would lose their jobs. 
In conclusion, I think the OPT extension will benefit the States much more than the so called competition.
