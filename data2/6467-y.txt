Lexi Dai Strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 
As an international student holding my F1 visa, STEM extension will give me much more motivation to stay in the country and keep making contributions to the country after graduation. A longer training time provides a better opportunities for us to turn what we learnt at school to abilities to contribute the industry. If the government stops offering this, it will lose many talents around the world.
It is never the case that foreigners will get jobs easier than Americans even if they are allowed to get longer training time. They eventually requires sponsorship from the company to continue working at some point. Natives will always be favored by companies comparing to foreigners who have similar level of skills. 
International students who successfully land jobs in U.S. have paid great efforts even before coming to the U.S. They usually pay much higher tuition fee than the natives in college or grad school. Not to consider their efforts in obtaining a job within an unfamiliar culture in a limited period of time. Companies don't hire people because of their nationality. 
They hire people because of their knowledge, achievement and their potentials. If companies see those from a native american, there is no reason that they will not offer him/her the job.
If international students have brought a bit more competition, it should be treated as an encouragement for the Americans to study and work harder which will definitely benefit the country. 
United States would never have such international power if it did not welcome immigrants and attract talents from all over the world. This proposal is a great step for it to continue doing the good thing and achieving more power.
