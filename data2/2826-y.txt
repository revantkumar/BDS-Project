Ajay Lakshminarayanarao I support the change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. This increased duration of practical training will enable me to apply the knowledge gained in my master's degree to the full extent. The OPT Extension will also enable to exchange ideas and build better solutions enabling to increase the economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness of this nation.
