I absolutely support this new OPT extension rule. As a foreign student, when I choose the place to continue my graduate study, I have multiple choices, the main reason I choose US is that it can offer me the industry training opportunity after graduation, without this OPT extension rule, I think US could be much less attractive to foreign talents to contribute their knowledge to this country.
And as a student major in computer science, many research projects of my field requires more than one year to finish, without this OPT extension, we will lose our VISA even before the project is done, so it will leave us no choice but decide not doing any research at US at all.
