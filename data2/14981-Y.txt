As an international student, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Globalization of the world markets leads to a growing trade relationship among countries. New international graduates can bring opportunities for doing business in the global environment.
2. This is just about the extension of STEM OPT, not about H1B visa. So the extension of STEM OPT will not affect the jobs for US citizens.
