I Strongly support this proposal. Earlier today, I ran into some comments who opposes this proposal. And the author's reasoning goes like 'It was already painful for me to get green card and citizenship, and now I cannot find a job because these OPT students are working so hard. Why should they have this privileges!!' Anyone else find that this is ridiculous? Is this the core American spirit that EVERYONE IS BORN EQUALLY?
