That's an important and useful proposal! 

Everyone should admit that our society needs talented people. Why USA can attract so many talented people from the whole world? One of the major reason is the policy that treat professional people respectfully and equally. OPT and OPT extension play an important role in this aspect. That's a major advantage of USA can attract more talented people compares to other countries, like England, German.

Technology and science means a lot to the whole country and STEM program(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) is strongly related to theses areas. OPT extension is for STEM student, this proposal can make sure USA have enough time to train and find out the most suitable people in science and technology areas. Can you imagine America operate without those people or people that just work for one year as a newbie? 

People may insist that Americans can fill the technology and science positions. To be honesty, in STEM university program, foreign students occupy a considerable numbers. It's far away that American students can fill this hole after graduate.

As a conclusion, we need OPT and OPT extension to attract enough professional people to build and develop our society.
