I want to voice my opposition to the improving and expanding training opportunities to F - 1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and Cap Gap relief for all eligible F1 students. It is an unfair disadvantage to American students and workers. In fact I totally disagree with any visas and/or immigration, legal or illegal. No to the ICEB proposed rule!
