xiu yang I strongly support this rule. 

I don't think foreign students will take jobs from local people. Because these students will go back home after their OPT. These students can not live in USA forever, how can you say they take jobs from locals. If these people who can not find jobs by only blaming on high educated and well trained students, I want to say even the OPT does not exist you still can not find jobs.
