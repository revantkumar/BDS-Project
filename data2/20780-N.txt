I view this program as a way to give employers in this country a cheaper work force as well as a means for immigrants to remain in this country after going through the program. All of this undercuts our very own citizens which is appalling. I expect my government to assist our citizens first without fail.

It is my understanding that in the years 2009-2013, OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs. I also understand that OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Why does this happen? Is my government not working for me?

There seems to be no oversight for the program as it exists today. What security measures are in place? Regarding the people presently in this program, do you know where they are presently working and living? Does the American worker get the same benefit as those accepted into the present program?

Personally, I'm ashamed that my government would not protect its citizens better than an outsider.
