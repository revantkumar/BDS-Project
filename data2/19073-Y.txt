I strongly support the proposal of improving and expanding OPT for F-1 students with STEM degree. Both the US and international students will benefit from this proposal.

First, as we all know, students with a degree in STEM are always in a shortage in the job market, those students are not taking anyone else's job because the jobs they are taking are still short for qualified employees.

More important, US's economy relies largely on high-tech companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon etc. Those companies gain their edge from people with skills in math, computer science, engineer and technology. Many of the basic technical work are just done by STEM students (young tech professionals) working with their OPTs. If OPT extension cancelled, the cost for completing those basic yet demanding work would be driven much higher and thus it would lower the competitiveness of those companies and in turn affect US economy negatively. 

Third, US's non-farm payroll jobs have been keeping added on and on in a trend since the policy of OPT extension for STEM was implemented, which shows this policy did not hurt any chances that for a competent American would be hired. On the contrary, the policy facilitates and accelerates the US economy's growth and recovery. More and more US companies have been founded in recent years due to available and affordable technical labor supply. This trend also created more jobs for Americans.

In sum, STEM students working with OPT are such a small portion(less than 0.5%) of workers which is too small to affect Americans' jobs opportunities yet is so important as their contribution to a lot to US economy and tax revenue.
