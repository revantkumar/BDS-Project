I strongly support the extension. Many international students are qualified with the positions that many citizens are not qualified or unwilling to do. Competition can help US to keep outstanding people and keep powerful strength in the global competition. Without this extension, many students need to go back, which will help their own countries to exceed US. US will lose a lot competition without this policy, I promise.
