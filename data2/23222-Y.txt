I've been worked in a high-tech company for years, and I met so many talented people from all around the world. I saw they work really hard to make the world a better place. I'm so happy we as American can provide a desirable environment for those gifted people to grow and make the world a better place. At the very beginning of establishing this great nation, our ancestors dreamed to create a place where there is freedom and love, and it might be a good idea not forgetting about that dream. And of course, it's easy to understand how they benefits our society as a whole through their hard work.
