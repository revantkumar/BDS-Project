I am an international student and pursuing master degree in US. I absolutely support with this extension. This OPT extension is for STEM foreign students who have achieved high education, and can definitely contribute a lot to the American communities. Many people here misunderstood one thing is that STEM students like us are not ones who steal jobs away from US citizens. We are high-educated, equipped with high-tech skills. Many of our jobs are way well-paid than the average. We are contributing to this country. Even many high-tech companies couldn't hire enough qualified employees. So stop saying that we are given less-paid jobs and make you unemployed. Truth is if this extension is not approved, a lot of high-tech companies will lose many great foreign workers, which is a disaster to not only the whole industry, but also the economy and development of technology in US. Make the wise choice please!.
