The proposal allows foreign students to stay legally inside the United States and receive training for their concentration of study. I am a foreign student who is currently on STEM extension. Before I was hired for this job, I was the backup candidate on the list. The No. 1 candidate was a US citizen who declined the job offer a few days before his official start date. My salary is the same as everyone else under the same title in my company. My friends hired by American companies are doing what are related to their major and getting paid the same amount. I cannot say that there are no companies hiring foreigners on lower wages (which creates unfair competitions for American workers). But my experience tells me that cases like that are probably very few. 

I have finished several projects since I started in this company. And I am grateful for my employment opportunity because the research environment in my company is up and healthy. Before my 12 month OPT was exhausted, I did not get chosen in the H-1B lottery. My company did not want to lose me because I have just been fully trained in the company's environment. STEM extension allowed my company to keep me for an extra 17 month. During this period I can continue to apply for an H-1B visa. Recently H-1B visa application number has increased dramatically. Without the STEM extension, employers would feel unsure to hire foreign STEM students because they might lose them a year later. 

I am supportive of the new ruling on STEM extension. It makes hiring a foreign student easier and more regulated. It provides opportunities for foreign students to receive better training, and US companies to benefit from a highly trained labor force.
