I support the proposal. Many US employers like us cannot find qualified US citizens for the jobs that requires deep understanding in STEM. Similar to a probation period in a labor contract, the OPT extension helped us to retain the talented and exclude the unqualified. The approval of OPT STEM extension will significantly promote our competitiveness in science and technology as a nation.
