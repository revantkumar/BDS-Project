Why on earth are you considering a policy that will make Americans compete with the world for an American job? Don't you realize every STEM graduate from another country will displace an American graduate? What chance does a minority or lower income American graduate who busted their butt to get a STEM degree from a "lesser" university have against a foreign graduate from MIT? American students will justifiably not pursue a STEM degree in the future if they don't have a chance of getting a job. What will that do to America?

The software giants who are pushing for this legislation can easily hire a STEM graduate from a foreign country in their existing offshore locations in India, China, etc. Also, there is no shortage of American STEM workers. Look at the unemployment statistics and you'll see this. If there were a shortage, wages in this area would be going up. They've been flat for many years now.

Another affected group will be older American STEM workers (in this field, 40+ is older). They will be displaced by foreign STEM graduates.

If you think this policy is a good idea then why not bring in the best steelworkers, electricians, politicians, etc from other countries as well and displace even more Americans?

America seems to be the only country in the world that fails to protect its own workers.
