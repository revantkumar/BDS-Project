As a tech firm owner, I actually support this new rule. These educated international students are pretty qualified in the tech area and most of them are doing great. People may complain they steal the jobs, but the truth is competition is the core of job market, if someone is better than you, you lose the chance. And to be honest, I would like to hire the local people, but most of time, it just doesn't work out, because most of best programmers are international students. Stop complaining, just learn more from the outer world. The reason why US is the strongest country ever is because it absorbs best people from all over the world.
