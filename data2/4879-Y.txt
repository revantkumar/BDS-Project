I support this proposed rule based on the following reasons:

1. International students contribute a large amount of money into the economy of the United States, including tuition and living expenses.

2. International student bring huge benefits to the colleges and universities in the United States, for example, financial impact and cultural diversity.

3. International students assist the development of new technologies and scientific research. Especially, this proposed rule allows more STEM workers to contribute themselves to the technology innovations.

Based on the reason above, I strongly support that the proposed rule, which can attract more international students to attend the U.S. institutions.
