I believe, instead of STEM OPT extension, post completion OPT should be made of 36 months so that the F-1 student does not have to renew OPT after 12 months. Moreover, they should be granted H-1 Visa without the quota system. This will contribute to the American economy and will encourage the skilled student to stay in US without being competition from a foreign (home) country.
