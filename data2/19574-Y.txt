We should support the extension for below reasons.

1. International students are consuming US education resources. We should let them contribute to US economy if they are qualified.

2. US education system is the talent pipeline to our country. We should allow them to work with OPT as long as our employers wish, or we should simply adjust our education system and stop recruiting international students.

3. H1B cap is wrong by nature. We should let every US graduated international students legally work if they are competitive enough.
