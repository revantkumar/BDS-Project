3. What's going to happen if the STEM fields get better? Better economy and more job opportunities. With the healthy development of STEM, it will greatly help the economy of the country. Besides, better development in STEM means more companies. More companies means better job opportunities. So although there are some citizens are concerned about the job opportunities being affected for now, with better foresight, government knows that this program is better for the country. 

4. This program is just an opportunities for international STEM students to find jobs and show their values. It is not a guarantee and there are still competence. So the companies will make the fair and smart decision that who will be more useful and helpful to the companies. 

5. What if just ask all the international students to leave after the 12
