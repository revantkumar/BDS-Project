Haoyun Tang, Columbia I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1: The government should let the students who learned knowledge from US university stay in the country and let them keeping making contributions to the US.

2 Diversity is very important to US culture and science development.Most of these famous scientists and engineers who did contributions to US economy and technologies were international students 

3 Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Most international students have advanced skills and knowledge which are badly needed in industry filed. US has imported qualified engineers from the rest of the world for a very long time, which is a very great power to support US economy thriving.
