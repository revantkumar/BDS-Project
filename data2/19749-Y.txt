I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal. It's very unwise if the US provides excellent education but not allows educated students to contribute their talents. I can't believe some people are against the STEM extension because of the potential competition it may bring. This is 21st century, how to make progress without competition? If a government "protect" its local people by rejecting foreign workers, I deeply doubt that this country will continue to be prosperous. A true powerful country won't be afraid of competition, instead, competition can stimulate creativity and diligence. I won't regret leaving the US if a wise decision can't be made, because it determines the future of this country.
