We as a country should be reducing foreign workers instead of increasing them. Our focus is should to give US citizens a better chance of finding employment. The cost of these programs by removing funds from social security and medicare trust funds must stop. These companies that hire foreign workers save money by not paying social security while costing the American taxpayers and workers seeking to find employment. Our funds would be better suited to improve the quality of the American students to compete better and limiting unnecessary foreign competition. When will decisions be made by placing America first? Technology has replace many American jobs and we don't need unnecessary foreign competition.
