I SUPPORT extending STEM OPT.

Extending OPT will attract more talented students to enter universities in the US, which will make US universities more competitive globally.

As an international student, working experience is really important, and OPT is the reason why I choose to study in US not other countries. I can get some working experience before I go back to my home country.

I believe STEM students are very talented that will help build the high-tech companies even better. Especially, their experience will help explore market in their home country.
