I oppose the DHS proposed rule to expand the OPT Program. This expansion would allow U. S. Companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years at lower wages and avoid paying payroll taxes. This expansion would adversely effect qualified American Citizen Workers by reducing job opportunites, reducing wages, reducing payroll taxes that support social security and reducing significantly jobs for recent American Citizen College Graduates.
