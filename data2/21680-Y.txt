I think it would be great if the OPT can be expanded. There are several reasons that I am considering. 
1) Expanding OPT does not mean international students will take american citizen's jobs. I am currently a graduate student in STEM major, and I could say more than 60% graduate students in my program are international students. Therefore, it would normal that in the industries there would be more international students looking for jobs, and it would make sense that international students can have more experience.

2) International students should get more experience for their related studying filed. If an international student go back to home country to work directly after graduate, studying in american would be meaningless. Having working experience in US, and then go back to home country, will make them more competitive. 

3) Expanding OPT will attract more international students come to study at US institutions, and could solve some financial issues that some colleges may have. 

4) Everyone should have their right to choose where to live, work, study, and what kind of person he wants to be as long as it is legal. 

Therefore, I would say expanding OPT for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students is a win-win, and necessary.
