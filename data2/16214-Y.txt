I am a researcher and I heard the OPT extension news from my foreign colleagues. When I browsed the comments, I am very surprised that there are so many US people want to push these brilliant young people out of the US, while the rest of the world is catching up in quality science research. Foreign students come here because of the international reputation of US universities, but they themselves are a big reason for that reputation. Foreign scientists fill 49% of the mid-level positions that make up the backbone of the scientific labor force at U.S. research universities.
However, U.S. universities currently have little trouble attracting talented international scientists, because the competition for global scientific talent is growing. Our global share is shrinking, largely thanks to increases in R&D in Asia. China's maturing research institutions are a net benefit for the world, but they will eventually make it more difficult for U.S. labs to compete for talented Chinese scientist. Science has always been most successful when countries exchange ideas, talent, and resources. United States will continue to benefit strongly from the participation of international students and scholars in our research enterprise, if we could allow them stay for longer time.
