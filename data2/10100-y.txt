Xiao Ye This is my second comment on this proposal as I want to bring more points to people's attention. As a strong supporter for the proposal, I'd like to put forward and reiterate a few counter points to some of the most common misconceptions brought up by people on the other side of the conversation:

1) STEM students work in the United States while on OPT or OPT extension are NOT illegal immigrants. This is absolutely false. Please review the official information following the links below:
http://www.uscis.gov/eir/visa-guide/f-1-opt-optional-practical-training/f-1-optional-practical-training-opt
https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/17-month-opt-stem-extension 

2) Executive order's ability to bypass Congress is NOT illegal. The legislative body is not required to approve any executive order, nor can it overturn an order. 

3) Only master's and PhD students in the STEM fields are eligible for OPT extension. This community is only a small part of the entire applicant pool who files for H1B every year. 

4) If a candidate of U.S. citizenship is unqualified for a job that requires specific master's/PhD level training in STEM fields, it's NOT because the job is taken by an international STEM student, it's because he/she is NOT qualified. 

5) There's absolutely no evidence supporting the claims that companies pay lower than average wage to STEM students or STEM students willfully consent to lower than average wage in order to secure employment.

Again, in order to have a meaningful dialogue on the pros and cons of this proposal, people need to base their arguments on facts and logic, not lies and accusations.
