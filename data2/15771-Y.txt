I'm working as software engineer with F1 visa and OPT STEM. Based on my own experience, I could tell that OPT and OPT STEM extension is important for American economy, especially for the IT industry. Internet is changing our life and there is a whole bunch of companies in Silicon Valley that are running business about Internet (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Uber, just to name a few famous ones). Their product is changing the way we live, helping us to know more information (Google, Twitter), get in touch with new/old friends (Facebook) and provide more convenient way to travel (Uber). But to achieve that, they need ENGINEERs, and there is a lacking of engineers right now in California. In contrast, many students of OPT STEM majors are qualified engineers, they are smart, passionate, and willing to make this country a better place by building great product. Without them, many tech companies can't even run their business since they can't hire enough engineers. To make it worse, since the probability of getting H1B visa is getting lower and lower every year, if the OPT STEM is revoked, then most students will doom to go back to their homeland after 1 year of their graduation. Right after they are familiar with their work, learned the skills to work efficiently and ready to make greater contribution to the company or even to the country, they will have to go back home. Or they might even decide to study in a different country (e.g. Australia) if that provides them with higher possibility to stay in that country after graduation.

In short, there is no doubt that 24 months OPT STEM extension can boost the economy of this country, improve the qualify of our life, and make America stronger and more competitive in the world.
