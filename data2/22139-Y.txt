I think expanding OPT for STEM graduates is good for American economy for they are a major driving force for technology companies. One year is too short for STEM graduates to gain sufficient technical or professional experience that would allow them to make contributions to their employers. Moreover the hiring cost is too high for tech companies if many of their hires have to leave after a year.
