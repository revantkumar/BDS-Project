Greg Smith Please don't help the tech company CEOs take all of our domestic
employment opportunities. I spent 29 years as a scientist in the
semiconductor industry, but with all the cheap labor from Korea
and China I don't think this would be possible now, and less so
if you do this. How you people can get any joy out of destroying
your nation is beyond me.
