I support the OPT for F-1 STEM students. A great state needs these STEM students to keep the US be the super power in the world.
And such positions not thread the American job opportunities. Because American prefer business positions, these positions are easier to earn money and social state. While seldom American prefer STEM related positions, because these positions need a lot of energy to study but earn a little.

SO, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD KEEP THE STEM STUDENTS TO HELP KEEP THE SUPER POWER IN THE WORLD.
