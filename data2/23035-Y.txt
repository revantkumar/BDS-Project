I am a U.S. citizen and I support this rule. I think the rule is beneficial to U.S. overall. First, this rule will encourage more international students to study in U.S. and boom the economy. According to reports available through NAFSA (Association of International Educations) it has been estimated that international students and their families have contributed $26.8 Billion to the US economy and created or supported 340,000 jobs during the 2013-2014 academic year. Second, the competition between local American students and F-1 students will be a driving force for them to improve their skills. If we just want to avoid competition and shut the door, we are happy for now, but will face competition from other countries like Russia, China, Inida later. Why not keep the top talents from these countries and make them work for us? It will help U.S. to reinforce its power in the world.
