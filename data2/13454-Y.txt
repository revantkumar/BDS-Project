First, SUPPORT this rule. This is a good sign for Americans are keep receiving high-tech immigrant.

Second, I have to object the reason and the data the opposers put in their argument.

1. U always keep arguing that STEM students steal jobs from Americans. They are all highly educated people. They are the potential guys to create new high-tech company and create more job positions. And if your children or yourselves are eligible for the position. Why the employer will hire another guy with poor language efficiency and different culture background. The fact is that there are not enough people can do the jobs. For example, if I need a MS from Computer Science and related major. I can't hire enough people with those two requirements. What should I do? My company needs to grow. The share holders urge me to make the company more competitive. I need men to do the jobs. 

2. If u think those students stop Americans from getting their jobs, why u don't attack the low-payed and low-educated people from outside of the country? Every year they take the majority of the H1b visa and move people without US education background to US. And also the illegal immigrant from Mexico and Caribbean countries. Think about those cases.
