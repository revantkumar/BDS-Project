Stuart Demrese I strongly support this new rule! The STEM international students are the potential immigrants that have good educational background and are likely to be a positive power in US society. 
For those of you who say US should shut the door to international students, you don't realize that even the STEM students can't work in US, this won't help preventing illegal workers rushing to US as usual and occupy your worker's positions. It's the illegal immigrants doing low paid jobs hurting US economy, not the students working with OPT extension!
