We should support this article, giving students with STEM more chances to find a job, create a company, and then create opportunities for more Americans and people in this country. This is what USA is about! We should even go beyond this and give green card to PhDs graduating from STEM programs! It's simply stupid to let them go back home after learning all the skills. Don't you understand the concept of brain drainage?
