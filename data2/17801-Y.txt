There is no harm for U.S. government to extend the OPT to 24 months, it's still F1 VISA. To create work opportunity for U.S. citizens, checking carefully on H1B VISA is the first thing should be done. Everyone know thousands of people cheat in H1B. Those consulting company is the guys who are really depriving local people of their job. 
So, please be nice to those student. U.S. government cannot do things like make money by encouraging someone to study in U.S. then, after all money received, drive he/she away. 
On the other hand, if the extension no longer works, those who stay in U.S. will be the guys lucky or cheated not really needed for U.S. Is all that you guys really want to see?
