I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE STEM EXTENSION PROGRAM and I do believe that any opposition to the STEM extension program is extremely short-sighted and will be a severe detriment to the U.S. economy and related industries in both short and long run.
To begin with, OPT STEM students are international students BUT NOT IMMIGRANTS. They want to learn how to solve problems, how to cooperate with different kinds of people. If they dont have an opportunity to work with other people in America, it will be less meaningful for them to accomplish their study in America because they cannot have a chance to transfer what they learn into the practical skills successfully. After they return their home country, they will be less competitive because students in their home country have much more work experience and they can accomplish their missions better. It is obvious that it will be less attractive for students, who are usually spend a lot of money on their study, to pursue their academic success in America. The loss of talented and excellent people will cause the decline of the levels of BOTH American ECONOMY AND EDUCATION.
Furthermore, International students have already had a difficult time finding STEM jobs in the U.S. Honestly, no one can deny that U.S. citizens with a STEM background are always preferred to international students who are the same qualified. In fact, international STEM students have to be MORE hardworking and qualified to get a job which U.S. citizens can easily get. On the contrary, competition will stimulate the development of American economy and industries, which can help America maintain the leader of world.
