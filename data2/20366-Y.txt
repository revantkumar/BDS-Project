I agree with 24 month opt extension ( add the extra 7 month)

Firstly, the US revenue will decrease as studying in the US is no longer be attractive to foreign students because of the shorten OPT. Now there are more than 88,0000 international students in the US, which made great contribution to the American finance. As an international students, I chose the US rather than Europe for study because DHS gives our international students 29-month OPT after our graduation. 

Secondly, cutting the 24 month OPT extension will lead tech companies hard to find and maintain foreign talents. High tech industries with tons of job openings need huge amount of foreign talents to fill in. The amount of local talents are obviously cannot meet the demand. Foreign staffs become indispensable components in those companies.
