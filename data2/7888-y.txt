Eric Miller I hope that people READ THE ENTIRE PROPOSED RULE before you leave any comment.

I strongly support this rule. The OPT program is beneficial to STEM sector of America economy enormously and it has attracted lots of talents from all over the world to further contribute to this country. Top students and talents such as Mathematics Olympics Medalists from China, Russia and India come to get higher education and training through this program. They later become a major work force in companies such as Google and Facebook, creating awesome products and improving quality of life of Americans. They are not stealing jobs from American citizens. Instead, they have created countless jobs for Americans through startups, keeping America at the top of world in engineering area. You can see lots of examples especially in software engineering area if you're familiar with this field or if you go to silicon valley and explore.

To those who couldn't get a STEM job and blame this program for stealing jobs from American citizens, your ignorant claims will impede America from growing. You might lower the unemployment rate in a year by stopping more talents to work here, but the development of engineering sector won't be as fast, and the consequences will show up in the long run when other countries get more skilled work forces. Making up false claims to incriminate foreign students will not help you get employed.

As stated in the rule, the average wage of OPT workers is much higher than Americans. They are creating more value than average americans. Failing to approve this rule will cost more than what we have supported these students. The problem resides in the large number of illegal immigrants, not skilled foreign students.
