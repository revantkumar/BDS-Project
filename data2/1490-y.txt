Chase George I strongly approve this rule made by DHS.
International students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in their field of study (Example Solar Energy, Medical Research). Best practices from employers/industries can be reached to the Universities. Without practical training the education for 3 years will not prove to be beneficial to the students (Ex: mobile- android/iOS development). Students acquire skills and specialized knowledge in their chosen studies ( Ex: Cancer Research, Stem Cell Research, Nano technology)
