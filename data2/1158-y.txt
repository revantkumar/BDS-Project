Alex Wang I would applaud for this extension. Opening the door of job market to foreign students will improve the country's economy, as most of these students are well-educated, and also very motivated to work hard to fulfill their dreams. Furthermore, the extension will stimulate domestic students by competition, and as a result, they will actually be more skilled and competitive after such competition.
