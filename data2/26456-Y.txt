International students are not cheap labor. They are actually more expensive labor. The H1B and green card sponsorships take a lot of money and time, with complicated procedures. Our hiring decision is based on performance and qualification entirely, not skin color or national origin. This is why America is great and strong. If you still believe companies prefer international students over American students, please attend a job fair at some universities. You will certainly see that companies prefer American students, because they don't require pricey sponsorships. Only the top international students can get hired and contribute to the USA. Therefore OPT is a win-win for America and talented international students.
Best wishes to you
