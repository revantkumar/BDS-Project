Feng K I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students.

People cannot equate OPT with the general immigration problem. It is not even immigration. It is funny that US allows a lot of illegal immigrants to come to this country for free but does not give qualified people who are anxious in creating value for the United States to stay.
