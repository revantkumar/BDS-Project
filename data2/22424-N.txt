This program, according to information that I have received, has raided Social Security (2009-2013; plus may be the current situation) taking 1 billion dollars per year for a program that does not benefit Seniors. As a senior, I feel that this has affected me personally. The federal government took my personal money while I worked telling me that this money would be there when I needed it as a senior. Now, the monies are being taken for something that I did not authorize nor will benefit me. The federal government has robbed, has not been a good steward of the monies given, is giving away my money, and has created future problems for me and other seniors because of this action. This is criminal action. If a bank robber came into a bank and robbed money, the person(s) would go to jail and suffer the consequences. Robbery of seniors, of which I am one, plus squandering of the monies is a total disservice to those who have given into Social Security no matter how lofty, eloquent, and technical you state your goals and aspirations to help "students". My personal recommendation is that this and any similar program that takes money from Seniors ought to be completely dissolved. The monies taken from Social Security need to be restored to their proper owners.
