Hang Yin It's quite ridiculous when you see Americans cheering for 'Free country', 'American dreams' with pride every day, and when a foreign student wants to join them, they turn him down and shouting 'This is our America and the gov should protect us by exiling those nerdy international students'.
Is this how you guys chasing your American dream? By protectionism rather than developing yourselves? By sitting there and wait for gov to clear up those foreigners and give you jobs?
Come on, that's called lazy. America will not keep going with this laziness. 
Thus I support the opt extension.
