Greg Smith I received my PhD in physics in 1979 from "The" Ohio State University. About 20% of my classmates were foreign students. Now, it seems to be a much higher percentage. Most of the people being hired by my company during the last year of my work (2008) were from Korea or China. This revolving door approach to staffing our technology needs has resulted in the loss of most of the integrated circuit manufacturing industry to the Far East. The interests of the shareholders, who are decidedly globalists, are at odds with the interests of the American born engineers and scientists. This has resulted in fewer American born scientists and engineers being trained in our own schools, ones we've paid for by our taxes. Therefore, I disagree with the top management and shareholders of the so-called American technology companies, and think we should grow our own employees instead of depending exclusively on talent from overseas, especially those who don't intend to become American citizens (I assume that's who you're talking about here). Cynics might say that this exercise is an attempt to shake loose contributions from the semiconductor moguls. Since you politicos already have the California electoral votes in your bag, I guess it's not votes you're attempting to purchase.
