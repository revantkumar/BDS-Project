I strongly support this policy.

As an international student, the reason I choose to study in America is that I can work in America for 2~3 years after graduation. The work experience will be very helpful for my career development when I come back to my homeland. With no OPT extension, I can only work here for at most 1 year, which benefits me little. If I had known there would be OPT extension, I would have not come to study in America. I believe many international students share the same opinion with me. It is really unfair to cancel the OPT extension after we studied here for years and paid so much tuition fee!
