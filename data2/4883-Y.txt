I am in full favour of the OPT extension rule due to the following reasons. Firstly, this is good for the US economy. Prolonging OPT can attract many talented international students to come to US to study. In fact, many students who choose to study in the US are attracted by the OPT policy. There are many international students in the US, and these students bring a profitable sum to the US economy. Secondly, by having an ethnically diversified workforce, the US can appear more dynamic than not. Moreover, this can be used a a good chance to build or maintain good relationship with other countries.
