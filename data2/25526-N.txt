I oppose expanding the Optional Practical Training rule proposal by the Department of Homeland Security. Today, we have more than enough STEM graduates in this country who are US citizens and who are either unemployed or underemployed. And every year, more young people graduate from college with a STEM degree who cannot find a job in their chosen field. We do not need to look outside our borders to find qualified, talented, intelligent people. Every foreign student who stays in the US after graduation means one less job for an equally qualified US citizen. Is a comparable training program being offered to STEM students who are US citizens?

If our government wants to spend MY money on training programs for STEM graduates, those training programs should be for our US citizens only. I don't want MY tax dollars spent on allowing foreign students to take jobs away from US students.

This program should be killed. Period.
