I strongly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. 

Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree.

With experienced and recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is NOT at all wise to even consider providing companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

This is the United States of America....AMERICAN too many citizens are either NOT employed and even more AMERICAN citizens -- including me -- UNDER Employed!!!!

STOP the madness of killing AMERICA for AMERICAN citizens!!!!
