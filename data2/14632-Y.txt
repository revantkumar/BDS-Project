I strongly SUPPORT the new OPT rule.
Many international students are major in CS&EE, maybe they can build lots of startup companies after graduation.This can bring more job opportunity to America and benefit the technology. 
What's more, the standard to hire an international student is much higher than hiring an American citizen in many big companies, including more difficult interview questions and higher education experiences.And now many IT companies still CANNOT hire enough high quality employees. American citizens are more easily to find jobs than international students, so F1 students won't steal job opportunity from American citizen.
