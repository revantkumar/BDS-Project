I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons,

1. US has spent a lot of resource to cultivate these talents. After their graduation, we should let them make a contribution to the state rather than letting them go home directly. For the students with STEM degrees, they have real knowledge to help improve America's economy, improve Americans life and make America a better place to live.

2. Diversity is very important to US, which in fact is one of the reasons that make US the most powerful country in the world. It is the source that makes America a country which is pursing innovations all the time. If we give up this, we give up a promising future.

3. Allowing F1 students to find jobs here after graduation does increase the competition. But it is not a bad thing. It can help to improve the quality of American talents and eventually could be a virtuous cycle.
