I do not support this proposed rule change for the following reasons:

1-My tax dollars that go to public schools are to educate American citizens, not aliens. Americans pay the taxes for benefits that should go to those paying for the services. For this one reason alone i do not support any Visa for aliens to attend any publicly funded schools, universities, community colleges, etc.

2-The Federal Government does not effectively track visa holders. Expanding in any way Visa programs for any reasons does not improve the security of Americans. This includes cyber security that may be impacted by more aliens holding jobs in the US that deal with corporate software and internet security.

3-The Federal Government does not effectively deport visa holders who have expired Visas. The ineptness in enforcing Visa deportation rules should be ample reason to not expand the stays of any Visa holders. The longer the aliens are in the country the more unlikely they will leave on their own.

4-I do not support any program that encourages alien workers to displace American citizens.
