The new proposed 24 months STEM OPT extension length is appropriate and will be extremely beneficial to U.S. universities, U.S. advanced research project agencies, and for promoting efficiency in U.S. education.

As a professional research associate at a university, my experience showed that the average length of a research project in Electrical Engineering is around 3 years. While the average program length for Ph.D. students is 5 years. Therefore, it is very common for students to be involved in two or more research projects, and to graduate with their research project unfinished. Some graduated students choose to stay with the university for a bit longer to either help new students get involved or finish report writing. This promotes smooth transitions in these research projects. 

However, after graduation, foreign students without OPT cannot be employed as research assistants nor continue working on their original research project. Most foreign students choose to leave the university and look for industrial work experience very early because of the pressure from limited OPT time. As a result, the research projects have to go through the hardship of finding support and guidance for new students and fall behind due to these issues.

With the new 24 month OPT extension, foreign students will be both able and more willing to help wrap up their research projects after graduation. This eliminates the inconvenience of discontinued work force and associated costs for universities and government funding agencies.
