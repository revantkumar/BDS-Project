I strongly oppose the additional visas that congress is planning to increase so business can bring in more foreigners and immigrants, at the expense of Americans who are in need of a job. I will not vote for any politician who approves and votes for any more Visas (H-1B, H-2B, and any other Visa program) that results in less jobs for Americans who are in need of a job, whether they are high or low income workers, students and/or teens. These visas need to be cut back, not increased.
