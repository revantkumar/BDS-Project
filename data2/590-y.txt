bob danton I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
As a 20 year vet in IT I observed most companies have over 50% foreign nationals, some I work for: General Electric,
Morgan Stanly, Swis RE, Toys are US are at 100% foreign nationals programmers. 
This helps my position as a computer consultant as I provide programing specs and monitor projects, but makes me feel sick 
as many or these good paying positions are putting my older experienced friends out or work. 

1) Why are we giving foreign grads as advantage over our kids who have large college loans?
2) Why are we training woman and inter-city youths for programing when we know these are becoming low paying jobs?
3) 80% of the foreign workers are men further warping the mail/female reto?.
4) We are leaving the most critical jobs (IT) to foreign nationals 10 yrs from now even the senior IT force will be foreign.
5) What is the season for this an why is the Dept of Homeland Security involved in this?
6) Most important I believe some of the Chinese in one of the companies are for the Chinese army hacking group and sending info back to china. 
Why would you let the Chinese IT personal work on our computer systems. NOT VERY SMART.
