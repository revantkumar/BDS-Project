Those international students are young, creative, diligent, and enthusiastic. They form a very big and important part in technology companies. Technology is the thing that prompts the economy to increase. If America could not be the greatest technology country, eventually its economy would be exceeded by Europe, Japan, Russia, China, etc.

Without this extension, as they did not have more time to stay in US, a student may have to leave US when he just understood how to do his work better and was ready to show his talent.
