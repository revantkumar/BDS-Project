I'm in support of all the provisions provided in the rule. The enhancement in the OPT period extension will greatly help in keeping highly skilled individuals in the United States and drive innovation. Besides, It shall also help in alleviate the fear of getting illogically deported among such individuals. Also, I'm in support of the provisions to protect jobs for the American workers, which addresses the grievances of tech unions. The extension shall greatly help motivated, educated, tax-paying individuals, the drivers of American high tech industry have a better chance at staying in America and continuing to drive the economic growth and innovation. I'd like to propose an addition of 12 months to the already enhanced 24 month extension period, resulting in a 36 month OPT extension period for STEM graduates.
