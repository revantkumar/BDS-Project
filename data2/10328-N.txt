American Jobs should go to American workers. When I needed money to go to college, I was unable to go because I could not get funding. BUT, you are handing out taxpayer money to let foreigners go for FREE and then give them jobs we so sorely need. When are you going to represent the American worker? Foreigners should NOT have access to things like our social security and Medicare systems, free shous. They haven't earned them like I have.

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds

This is common sense.
