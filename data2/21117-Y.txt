I highly agree with the new rule of 24 months OPT stem extension. It is surprised to hear the court denies the OPT Stem extension and will be effective in next February. If this is true, the county has to face a huge challenge in future that a large number of highly skilled and educated international employees will loss their jobs and have to go back to their own country. I believe this is a big loss for those companies. It also brings negative impact on the technology development of the country. 

US should keep excellent people stay in the country and contribute to the country. Many Stem major students are very technical and capable doing a great job in their companies, they should get better change to stay in the country as long as their companies are willing to provide their H1b visa for working. It's certainly good for US to keep the best excellent people to stay and contribute to the country. And this is why US has the most advanced technology and academic system in the world. 

Actually the job competition is a good thing and should be encouraged in those high technology fields. The job opportunity should be open and fair to all the competitive candidates. 24 months stem OPT extension will provide a better chance to those new international employees to stay in US for their career, and also provides broader choices for the companies. 

So in the end, I sincerely hope this rule could get approval. Thank you!
