To those who this concerns: I feel that bringing more immigrant workers is cruel to those who are legally residents of this country because it stops those who are legal resifents fromn getting a full or even part-time job just so that the immigrants can have one. Further more what is really, really cruel is that there are so many people in this country already who are jobless and DO NOT even have a rof over their heads or have any food to eat. That is what makes me so sticking mad about the idea of bringing more immigrants into this country when we can't even feed and house a lot of our legal residents in the first place. If any of you in the legislature could spend some time in the place of those who can't get a job and really need one maybe you would be able to understand why there are those of us who do not agree with you when it comes to bringing in more immigrant workers when we DO NOTneed them. And what makes them so much better that our own legal residents that they get the jobs first. Those who make their legal workers train immigrants to work and then loose their jobs because of ot are really greedy because they allow immigrants to take over the American workers jobs just so they don't have to pay as much for the work being done.
