I'm definitely supporting this extension of training period for STEM students. 
I work in an IT firm. Our team has 8 software engineers, 2 of which are Indian and 2 Chinese. They all perform quite good and have participate in several projects that bring lots of profit to our company. They're definitely qualified for their position. It would be a loss to our company if those employees are forced to leave the country when their training periods end.
