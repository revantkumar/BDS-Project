Shweta Sareen I strongly support this new Rule for F-1 students regarding STEM OPT and am very thankful to DHS for proposing this. My reasons for supporting this rule are as follows-
1) US is a super power and without doubt has done the most progress in fields of Science , technology, engineering and math, which forms the backbone of its success and technical prowess and hence there is a lot of work in these fields and in turn a lot of demand for skilled labor
2) This rule supports students with STEM degrees irrespective of their citizenship and ensures talent is retained in these fields irrespective of its origin and so the high demand for workforce in the STEM field is met
3) There are some 40,000 computer science bachelors degree earners each year but roughly 4 million job vacancies for computer workers, which actually indicates that we still need more skilled work force in STEM fields and hence its important this rule becomes a reality
4) The purchasing potential of these STEM candidates who hold high positions creates additional jobs in both the skilled and unskilled labor domain
5) Many tech start-ups in the Silicon Valley were started and are kept alive by students with advanced STEM degrees, harming the program would adversely affect economy in several ways
