Karan Aggarwal To,
Secretary of Homeland Security
Washington, D.C.

I am writing this comment regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees for F-1 students. I am a graduate student at University of Minnesota. The proposed rule will strongly affect my experience as a graduate student for this will limit my capability to get experiences through internships. The previous STEM OPT Extension that increased 17 months period to 24 months was very beneficial for international graduate students like me in getting enhanced experience in industry and research labs, to further my learning goals. 
I hope that the US, being fountainhead of STEM research, attracting best of international students for graduate studies, by providing unique combination of best researchers and leading industry, continues to accommodate best of international talent. I would like to thank DHS for working very quickly on the proposed rule to address the disruption created by the latest court hearing. I would also like to express my gratitude to the US for providing me this opportunity to pursue my graduate studies with the best resources in the world. 

Thanks,
Karan
