Hal Wu I strongly support the STEM OPT extension!

As a science student, let data talk! Not the personal feeling or any subjective stereotype!

OPT extension plan was firstly passed in the 2008, which is followed by the financial crisis raising the unemployment rate to 10%. After that, even though the number of STEM students keep increasing, the unemployment rate has reached the lowest in the history, which is 5.0% in October 2015 according to the bureau of labor statistics.

Furthermore, in this financial crisis, the foreign-born STEM students were proven to be the job creators. According to a report by the Technology CEO Council stated that entrepreneurial "start-ups are disproportionately founded and supported" by foreign-born individuals. As of 2009, foreign graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology alone founded an estimated 2,340 U.S. companies employing more than 100,000 people. A study from the University of California-Berkeley and Duke University found that over 25 percent of U.S. engineering and tech companies created between 1995 and 2005 had at least one foreign-born founder, and in 2006, these companies employed 450,000 people and claimed a combined $52 billion in sales.
