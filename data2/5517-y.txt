S Zhang I strongly recommend the approval of the new 24-month OPT STEM regulation, which brings enormous economic effect to US market, industry boost to IT companies and academic competence to US universities.

First of all, OPT and OPT STEM policy can attract more excellent international student to US. As an international student from China, the reason I choose to study in US other than Australia or Canada is because of the OPT and OPT STEM policy. I think many students from China and worldwide came to States universities for the same reason. If OPT STEM is revoked, US schools will instantly loose its advantage to University of other countries. And schools loose one of their main funding resources -- expensive tuition fee. As a result, US universities' academic competence will be hugely influence.

Second, canceling OPT STEM will make IT companies suffer from employee runaway. As a matter of fact, OPT STEM students are main work force in technology field and they have been bring considerable amount of benefit results to the industry. Many research and development require two years and even longer. If stem employees are forced to leave US, then who will the companies to look for to cover the gap? Besides, if employees are only allowed to work for one year, then he or she left just after the training and getting familiar with the business. The company need to hire new guys, which is a waste of time and money.

Last but not least, I don't think OPT STEM policy will increase home security risk. OPT STEM is only eligible for certain majors like engineering, which requires hardworking and decent academic record to get admitted by US universities and even more effort to get the degree. They are too busy to be doodling around and violating laws, especially not Asian students, who are very hardworking and count high portion of international students.

In my opinion, OPT STEM policy should remain valid and the new 24-month regulation is more than welcome.
