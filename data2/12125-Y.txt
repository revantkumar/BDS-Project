I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. As a teacher and immigrant, I believe that knowledge is the most important factor to economic growth and prosperity. The United States should retain talented immigrants who will contribute to the nation's future.
