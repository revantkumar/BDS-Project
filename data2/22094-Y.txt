To Whom It May Concern:

I strongly agree with improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students. As a leader in a large e-commerce organization, I have hired multiple foreign students on OPT and have found them to be very motivated, highly skilled, and a huge asset to the company. These students provide a great value to US businesses and, by extension, to its economy, and I support any government efforts to facilitate the learning, training, and eventual naturalization of such students, if they choose to stay. 

I would caution that the Mentoring and Training Program not be made so formal or stringent that it demotivates the hiring of such students. It is in the best interest of any manager and company to train their employees in order to maximize the return from their investment, and it is no different between an employee who is a US citizen vs. on a visa. 

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to the success of this program.
