I support this proposal since this action will take benefit for US economic growth and eligible F-1 students. Most of F-1 students are graduated from outstanding colleges and Universities. They got professional and adequate training in their academic courses. Giving their training opportunities to work in US can bring countless innovative idea and new development to companies. Also, companies can cut budget to apply work visa since 12 + 24 months can help some F-1students complete their first career goal. They maybe come back to their home countries and don't need work visa any more.
