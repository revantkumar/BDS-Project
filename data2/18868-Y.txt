Working or creating a startup in OPT duration is highly likely to enhance the business and economic thus bring more job opportunities to America. 
Also students in STEM may create or support more research in different areas during OPT. This may keep the advantage of leading place of the States in different industries.
I agree with most parts of the new rules. While I still hope there would be fewer constrains for students to apply or use OPT.
