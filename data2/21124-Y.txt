I support this proposal because F-1 students help fill in the technical expertise gaps that is lacking in the US job market. I know that companies prefer to hire qualified Americans because they do not have to go through the expensive H1B sponsorship process. The argument that STEM immigrant workers cost less is a myth with no supporting facts. The only reason companies hire STEM immigrant workers is because there is no available qualified Americans that can fill in that technical role. I'm not saying that international students are smarter than American students, but I'm just saying that there are just not enough American students in the STEM field. The US job market needs help and this proposal will definitely help.
