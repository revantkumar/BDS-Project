Rachel Lee I strongly SUPPORT this proposed rule to extend STEM OPT for 24 month. The extended OPT time duration will not only benefit STEM student in gaining major-related work experience, but will also benefit the American employers in making profits.

For students graduated with an STEM degree, after a couple of months training and working with different departments, they will be able to develop or get involved into varies projects for process improvements, product design, research, etc. These projects required dedication and time to develop and accomplish. And for any new hires, people would be able to work in full capacity and capability after learning and training for a period of time. If an STEM student would only be able to work 12 months, he or she would spend may be more than half of the 12 months being trained but could only contribute to the company's project for a few months, which is far from enough for most significant projects of a American company. Thus with the the 24 months STEM OPT extension, both American employers and STEM students can better utilize STEM students' expertise and make the time&cost employers spend on training STEM students to be justifiable and profitable.
