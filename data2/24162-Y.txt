I totally agree 24 months OPT Training Extension. 

"For more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed immigrants and refugees from around the world into our nation, enhancing our diversity, culture, and economy. Today, many individuals contributing to the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are immigrants or refugees, and research indicates that skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans."

High-educated F-1 student will greatly contribute to industry if they are more experienced. 12+24 months proposal is perfectly fit the need of industry. If they are given 12 months without 24 months extension, The employee and employer wouldn't benefit from it. Due to first year training based work and lack of experience. However, after 1 year of training, we are more professional and experienced. For my example, I can individually handle 5 projects at same time, with some proper direction. Besides I have a goal to been an professional engineer(PE) which required 3 years of work experience. So as a PE will highly benefit me and my company. 

Besides that The E-verify program gaurenteed and I was paid as the same as Americans. I'm not been lower paid.
