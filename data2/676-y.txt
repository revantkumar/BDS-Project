Alice Lei I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S, many famous technical company CEO were international students.Without the OPT extension, international students have less chance to contribute to the Us. IT industry.
