This is an AWESOME rule to HELP America!! Those STEM students who can find a job in America are skilled and intelligent students!! If government do not give them chances to work for America, it is a really huge loss for America!
You guys who oppose this rule should jump out of your own circle and broaden your horizons to think form national perspective!!
