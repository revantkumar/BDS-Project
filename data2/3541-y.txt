Anne Reiser OPT takes jobs away from AMERICANS. With so many Americans out of work the idea of letting in more foreigners is immoral.How can citizens support families? Through a Freedom of Information Act request, the Center for Immigration Studies confirms that 497,274 OPT work authorizations were granted by DHS between 2009 and 2013, and that $4 billion of potential contributions to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds were lost. This raiding of SS and Medicare funds and disregard for Americans must end.
