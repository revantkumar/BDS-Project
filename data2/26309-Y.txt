We live in a small town in Iowa. I support this issue because it will keep a lot of students who graduate from local college/university working for local business. I saw a lot of students have to leave this country when they lose the lotto of temporary working visa in the last April and a lot of local business suffering from losing new employees who just got trained to do their jobs. That was a pain for our economics growth.
