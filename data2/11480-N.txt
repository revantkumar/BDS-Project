I am an american out of work at the moment trying to find work and it is not a fair law where foreigners are getting jobs before americans in the United States. It is something that will make american people not only not be able to take care of their families but possibly lose all that their family from previous generations worked and strived to do and have so future generations would have a better future. Do not allow this blatent diregard of american rights, american liberties and american health and well being be destroyed by this law.
