Carol Park I am a research scientist in Ecology (Science), and I strongly support the new OPT rule for the following considerations:
1. many universities do not support H1B for entry level researcher positions, having an extended OPT period will help the transition of international scholars from entry level to more advanced positions that do support long term work authorization. 
2. most research projects have a cycle of at least 3 years in my field, therefore the new rule better meets the research requirement and will tremendously facilitate the efficiency of scientific research in the U.S.
3. Given that international scholar constitute an essential part of the whole scientific community (>30%), having more appropriate rules will help the retention of these intellectual talents and eventually advance the scientific research in the U.S.
