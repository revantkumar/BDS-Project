With 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S., 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs, and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs, American (tax payers) are obviously getting the raw end of the bargain. 
How exactly does this program benefit the American, tax paying Middle Class?
Employers obviously have incentives to take advantage of this ridiculous program.
