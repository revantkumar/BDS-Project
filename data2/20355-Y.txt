A large fraction of students come to US not for immigration. They just like US's culture or want to learn something. Most of them want to work in US for a few years and then go back to their home country. At the same time, they pay a huge amount of tuition fees to US universities. If they found that it is of little possibility to work for a few years in US. Fewer and fewer students would come here. And also it would cause much loss to US's economy. Because there would be less tuition fee and those excellent students would not contribute to American economics and technology.
