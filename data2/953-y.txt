Shuowen Wei If you are not working hard enough, if you are not good enough as "foreign" students, you doesn't deserve the jobs that "foreign" students are currently having or will have. It's not even a war between citizen job seeker and foreign students, it's all about equal opportunities and so I strongly support this OPT-extension. You are citizen because your ancestors came here a few decades ago and stayed, that doesn't make you qualified for the jobs. Stop being so shortsighted opposers!
