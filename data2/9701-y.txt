Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule.

Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. Many jobs are going unfilled simply for lack of people with the right skill sets.
