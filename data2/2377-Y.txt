OPT is an indispensable part of student's study and training. I support extending the term to 24 months because we are faced with a serious brain drain where talented and educated foreign students fail to contribute to the benefit of the US. We should encourage them to stay and give them opportunity to learn and train themselves. Any apprenticeship less than 24 months typically fails to achieve such objective.
