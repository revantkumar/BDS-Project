Zhuangzi Mozi International students have definitely made significant contribution to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy. STEM students also contribute through research, innovation, and most aspects of society. The jobs that STEM students look for are those involve heavy work and high pressure, which most U.S citizens are not interested in. The STEM international students just fill the vacancy in the corresponding high tech industry, which fosters economic growth in U.S and creates more job opportunities in turn. So I support the new OPT extension policy.
