To see what devastation the government has initiated on our country all you have to do is tour the roads and see all the companies that have closed. Politicians want to blame the high number of unemployed on companies who hire these foreigners. If the government did not provide the foreign workers, companies would not be able to hire them. Wake up and start helping the people who are citizens of this country. Do not allow the increase of foreign workers.
