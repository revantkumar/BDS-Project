Chandan M. I believe it is very important to provide the 24 month OPT extension period to F1 students. International students put in a lot of effort and incur a lot of expenditure to come to the US to pursue education. The OPT provides a constructive way to build an relevant experience in their filed of specialization. A duration of one year (the initial OPT period) is insufficient to build the foundation of a good career and if they are forced to go back after a brief period of just one year then it would be a major setback to their career.

Such an outcome would dissuade future international students to come to the US to pursue higher education. International students make a huge contribution to the teaching and research carried out in US schools and greatly increase its diversity. Such a system benefits both the schools and the students and should not be put in jeopardy.
