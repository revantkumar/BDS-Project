I strongly subscribe to the idea of F1 extension. Not speaking for foreign students, but our economy has to be stimulated by a substantial workforce. These foreign students will contribute a lot to our economy, boosting our GDP. They can work here 3 years at top, so looking from the long run they will not constitute a threat to our graduates. Enormous benefits versus a little setback, we have to support the implementation of OPT extension.
