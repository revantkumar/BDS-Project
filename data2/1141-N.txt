I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually provides incentives for employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers and the Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not be against it.
