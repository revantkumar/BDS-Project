I strong support DHS extend STEM EXTENSION period to 24 month. Let me take my experience as an example. I was a Chinese student, finishing my master's in US. I am currently working in a huge international communicaiton chip design company using my OPT time. Across my coleagues, there are asians, Indians, Europeans, and many location Amerians. Well known, we are from different educations and backgrounds. Indians are good at coding. Chinese does a lot of mathematics. The native speakers are really excellent at their presentations who make our products selling well. What I want to say is that we are not taking positions from each other, instead we are sharing the positions according to our variety of backgrounds. 

In additon, our company is facing high pression from compititors across pacific ocean. If we do not win, they will grain market share. So we internation students, no matter when graduated, what status we hold, what nationality we are, are trying hard to make our company stronger, not noly to protect ourselvies, but the America's leading in world wide market, and naive american's working oppotunity.
