First, I would like to express my gratitude to DHS for publishing proposed rulemaking for STEM OPT extension in timely manner. OPT Extension (24-month) along with 12-month OPT will help international STEM students significantly because academic, private or public organizations/companies require both academic knowledge and practical experience.

Please add Geography (CIP code 45.0701) in the STEM list. A paper was published in a peer reviewed journal why geography should be included as STEM (doi:10.5539/jgg.v7n1p27): http://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jgg/article/view/43858/24468

Also, please make "exit and re-entry" easy for international students. Initial OPT was 12 months and travelling outside of U.S. was no big deal for that periods. However, now students need to travel home and come back in 36-month period (OPT 12 month and STEM extension 24 month). Please make visa easy for OPT students.

Thanks DHS again.
