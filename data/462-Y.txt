There is no science at all for those who oppose this regulation!! How do you expect the students to practice sufficiently in Industry or fundamental research, with fresh and abundant knowledge from college? It won't make any sense, you just invite the internationals to pay for their tuition and get the butt of the continent right away without proper mentorship and training. It's just not the way modern education system is developed! And this is not the "hospitality" this glorious country should uphold!
