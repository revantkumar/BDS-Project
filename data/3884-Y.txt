I strongly support the STEM OPT extension rule.

International talents pouring in this country is one of the best asset that USA have in regards of both economy and future development. The STEM extension is one of the major leverage to attract new global talents. America is already losing in the percentage of international student globally every year, as other countries have realized the importance of international students and have been working hard to lure more to their own country. If the STEM extension is stopped, then America will face double loss. First, the international student will reduce significantly which means less economy from foreign countries; and the one who do come for education will move to a different country for work and helping helping them (not America); essentially taking the fresh brain and learning from America to other countries.
Of course, not 100% of international students are brilliant as gems; but a large portion of them really are (and the statistics provided in the proposed rule shows exactly the same). They bring economy, new talent, diverse approach, innovative thinking and a hunger to reach the peak of their respective fields. This results in high competition, which is a really good for America's future. Healthy competition always brings the best in all. Not everyone survives the competition and they are the lazy/complacent ones who sit and complain (and blog) that govt is "giving away" all the oppurtunities to "foreigners" and not to them.
I have met some brilliant american minds, and they all have complained about the shortage of intelligent brains in the country; partly because good portion of american citizen gets complacent fairly easy which doesn't help much in the country's growth/development. If a country only focuses on the smug/content citizens, they are bound to see diminishing growth and progress in future.
