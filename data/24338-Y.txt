I strongly agree on this rule. 
These brilliant students are the best gifts other countries can give USA. they spend 20 years on elementary school, middle school, high school and universities abroad then come to USA. They work on some advanced program for only 2 year and they are ready to serve US. Such a bargain! Not to mention most of them work for high tech companies, which are the leader of high tech industry over the world. These people's talents ensure these companies to be competitive from all time, and make US competitive at all time. And opt extension is the key to have these people legally serving US. Thus its esstiantial to have this OPT extension to keep these people as well as US competatie over the world.
