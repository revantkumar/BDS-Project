Since it is harder and harder to get H1B visa each year, expanding OPT for STEM students will truly benefit the U.S technology industry.

I am a software engineer working in silicon valley. When I was working for a startup company 3 years ago, the company planned to hire 3 more software engineers, but did not sponsor H1B for financial reasons. After 8 months, we only found one qualified U.S citizen for those positions. We could not even find 3 qualified U.S citizens to place the positions in 8 month... The company finally changed mind to sponsor H1B in order to hire qualified engineers.

As I see in silicon valley, more than half of engineers/specialists working for technology companies are immigrants from other countries. Some of them have became U.S. citizens, some of them are green card holders and some of them are still in OPT or H1B status. But most of them have the similar path: studying in U.S ->OPT->h1b->green card->U.S citizen. They are making major contribution to U.S technology industry now. Nowadays 85,000 H1B cap has been seriously insufficient for U.S companies. Expanding OPT period may be a remedy. I would suggest to expand STEM OPT to even more than 3 years. We need more talented professionals to stay in U.S.
