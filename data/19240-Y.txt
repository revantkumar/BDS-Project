As a PhD in statistics, and as the same with the 180,000 students who weren't fortunate enough to win the lottery of H1B VISA this year, I am facing the possibility of leaving US in a few months. I am enjoying my current job, which can leverage my research skills in quantitative modelling of big data to the large extent, and my current team are also in great needs of people like me. Failing to offer the students with STEM extension, especially under the current low H1B quota each year, is definitely making US losing talents directly and forcing these talents to go back their country and leverage their skills there. These students, if given the possibility of working in the US, at least can satisfy the great talent demands of US firms, and can even open their own business in US and in turn create numerous job opportunities in US. Thus, I believe the best choice for the future of US people and economy is extending the OPT for STEM students for at least 24 months, or even longer.
