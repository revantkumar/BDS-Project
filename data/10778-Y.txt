I support the rule proposed by HSD.

The beauty of America is that we got most talent people here from all over the world, making contributions to this society by doing great things in every single day. But apparently the rules now are not good enough for protecting these creative people. Mike Krieger, the co-founder of Instagram, almost had to leave America because of having VISA problem. We cannot imagine the world without Instagram changing our life.

Is 12 months OPT long enough for us? The answer is "No". Every single day matters. Mark Zuckerberg developed the first version of Facebook in few days, what if we have 36 months?

Acceptance made the whole story of America, and it is the only reason making America a greatest country in the world. Let's keep this great story going, together.
