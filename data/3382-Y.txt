As an employee of apple, I definitely support the proposal. It is not about helping Chinese, Indian or Korean, etc. It is about democracy, success, and improvement of this society. Everybody knows that in the most successful companies like Apple, there are a lot employees from all around the world. They bring new ideas, new power to these companies and the USA. They do help improve the world. Also, diversity is one of the most important aspect that US government considered. It is the key for the success of the current USA. No rule should try to stop those genius from other areas in this world from contributing their talent to this country and this world. Finally, I think it is also a great chance for native people and foreigners to communicate with each other. Everybody knows what international communications mean to the country nowadays. Actually, I can never see any reason to reject this proposal. Thanks!
