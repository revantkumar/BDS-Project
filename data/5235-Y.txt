Huayu Yang I strongly supposes the proposal. Many people who disagree with this proposal seems like they are afraid of competition, fears that they will lose to foreigners in job market and I think that's understandable. However, is the OPT program causes this? I don't think so, The worries come from the lack of self-confidence, not OPT program. Americans already have many advantages in job market, companies are more likely to hire Americans than a foreigner, because they don't need to provide visa sponsorship or green card. The only reason I can think about a company hiring foreigner instead of an American is because that foreigner stands out, not because the foreigner is on "OPT".

In addition, let's think about what happens if we send those Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics talents back to China, Russia, India and other countries who has power to challenge US. Is this really a good choice for US in the long run? Don't give those talents who willing to work for US any chance to stay in US, and kick them back to work for other countries and help those countries challenging US. Is that what we want? Will this help more Americans find jobs or cause many companies broken and thousand of Americans lose their jobs?

You may think that's not true, and thinking I'm talking without solid evidence. That's ok, I'm not persuading anyone, I'm just states the truth.
