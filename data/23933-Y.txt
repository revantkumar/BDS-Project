I am writing to support this proposed rule to give nonimmigrant students more opportunities to work in United States. I believe the entire United States as well as human beings will benefit from this rules. What is the most important thing in the 21st century? It is the scientific technology and more importantly, the people who carry the knowledge of science and technology. As a result, more and more job opportunities should be open to people who are highly educated and who are experts in science and technology. For example, an expert in a new field of nanotechnology can open a new field of industry, and thus, create more and more job opportunities. It has been proven many times in the history of United States that those talented nonimigants can bring an enormous contribution to the development of US and the entire world. F-1 nonimmigrant students are usually highly-educated in science and technology and they are, exactly the people you need in United States. You can always find people who are capable to work in Mcdonalds, but you will not easily find people who are able to work in Google, Facebook and Oracle if you lose these educated nonimmigrant studetns.
