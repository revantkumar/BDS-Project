I strongly support the extension for OPT. From my personal experience, OPT extension is one of the most attractive factor for studying in the U.S.

In recent year, U.S. universities and colleges has attracted a record-breaking number of 886,052 undergraduate and graduate students during the 2013-2014 school year. Among them, two-thirds are pursuing a bachelors or higher degree in STEM or business, management and marketing fields, versus 48 percent of students in the United States. (http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/geography-of-foreign-students#/M10420) International students contributed some $27 billion to the US economy last year, an increase of $3 billion from the prior year.(http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Education/2014/1117/Record-900-000-international-students-in-US-the-top-countries-they-hail-from). 

The open environment for foreign intelligent people, a.k.a OPT extension, is no doubt the most important reason why people come here rather than U.K, HongKong, etc. I personally received full funding from HongKong U and my friend from the U.K., but we choose to come here and pay our own tuitions because we could have a chance to practice what we've learnt before going back. Without the extension, companies will be unwilling to hire foreign students I am sure that this will harm the education industry.
