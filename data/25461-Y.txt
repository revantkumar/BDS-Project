I strongly support 24 months' OPT extension.
Before I came to United States for graduate studies, I've considered other european countries. Since the US has the OPT program with the possible OPT extension for STEM students, I decided to come to the US. Hands on training in the real world will give me good practice and lots of experiences. If we don't have OPT extension, one year is not sufficient to warm someone up for a job. 
For me, I have already worked in a big tech company for eight months. Some projects take more than 2 years to come up with a prototype. If I can't continue working in that, my efforts are all wasted. Someone else may need more time to take that over. I think it's a waste of labour if we don't allow enough time for the students to really do something well with their career. 
Since my employer participates in e-verify, I have lots of co-workers who also work on their OPT extension. It will have huge negative impacts towards the company if all of a sudden we cannot work any longer.
