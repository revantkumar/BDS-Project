Xueyan Zhu I absolutely support this. I am a graduate student, and I found almost 80% of the students who study computer engineering and computer science are F-1 nonimmigrant students in my school. If we don't improving and expanding training opportunities for them, who will work for the companies like google, facebook or amazon and so on? The information technology of this country is promoted by them. Trust me, you won't like sitting in front of a computer and writing code for a whole day, so you need someone to help you to finish it, and they are the F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees. Thus Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees is super necessary!
