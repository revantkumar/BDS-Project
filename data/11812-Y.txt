I strongly SUPPORT OPT-extension.

USA has good reputation to provide advanced education to people from all over the world. Most of the STEM majors need more training beyond regular school study so OPT provide F1 students the opportunity to get such training. OPT-extension just gives more time. Why that's a problem?

If some F1 student does find a job at USA, it is because the company see the talent of that person and understand the value he/she can add to the company. If you could not get that position, it is just because you are not fit for that role. To be honest, only losers will blame others "steal" their job.
