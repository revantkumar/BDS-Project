It's definitely necessary to expanding training opportunities for F1 no immigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all Eligible F1 students. Seeing from the percentage of the students in STEM major more than 60% are international students. 
American students normally don't choose this kind major but in the industry field all companies and cooperations need Internet platform, technical advisory team and develop team which are all filled by engineers and science researchers. Without those ppl states economy would be affected a lot. 
Think about how much money Apple Facebook software and Google bring from time to time. And it's not international students steal the job opportunities from local Americans, it is not that many local Americans choose this boring exhausted area.
So in Oder to keep the industries functional and bring up the economy of states which is tight up with every person's daily life, they hire great international students instead. Besides, there are tons of local firms being really clear that non international students are taken. So wether u can get a good job opportunity or not depends on how good u are not which race or nationality u are, is it the real American freedom and opportunity thing we always talk about? 
Then what's the point to claim that international ones threat the local ones to get a good job I just don't get this point. It should never be a reason to refuse the expanding opt time.
