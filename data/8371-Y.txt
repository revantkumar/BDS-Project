James Chen I strongly agree that there should be additional OPT extension for STEM students with F1 visa.

Some Americans oppose this policy while do not provide valid data to support their opinions. They just think longer extension of OPT for international students will lower the average pay or cause unemployment for Americans, which is ridiculous. STEM students only take positions require high technical skills while there's a shortage of that kind of students among US students. Also those technical positions are with high pay, which cannot lower average salary.
