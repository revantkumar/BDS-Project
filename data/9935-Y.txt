I strongly agree with the opt stem program . Opt stem does not guarantee jobs. It just gives international students the opportunity to find the jobs. I don't know why there are people saying" just because Native Americans cannot find jobs so government should ban the opportunities of the foreigners to find the jobs"! No competition is the worst thing to the economy .
