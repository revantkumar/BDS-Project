Dear officer,

STEM OPT extension becomes approachable only after a completion of 12 month of normal OPT.

STEM students will lose their work eligibility, projected career and life plan when OPT extension is revoked. They will feel desperate and miserable at the very beginning, but finally, they will find good jobs somewhere else, because, they have been well cultivated and trained by the U.S. education system and STEM employers for at least 2-6 years.

Our laboratory has more than 50% of international employees who are indispensable to us. Most of them obtained the H1B work visa by taking advantage of STEM OPT. Instead of pushing STEM student back to home country, the U.S. should provide better environment to them. In my point of view on this case, I suggest DPS provide 36 - 48 months of OPT extension to qualified STEM students. However, DHS should also provide more regulation to verify the STEM OPT eligibility.

Sincerely,
Stanley
