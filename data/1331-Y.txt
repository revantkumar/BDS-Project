Since the U.S government has spent so much money recruiting international students to come to the U.S. for various degrees, why do you force them to go back to their own country afterwards? They are highly wanted employees in their own country and are highly contributive. Having them stay in the U.S. is of great benefit to both. Expanding the training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students is surely a win-win decision.
