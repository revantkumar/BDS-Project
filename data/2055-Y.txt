I am a student and I am also an electrical engineer. I have worked at Apple, Amazon lab126, and now I am working at Facebok as a contractor. I love what I do and I really don't want to be forced to leave USA due to the visa issue. I am not here to beg for free food, beg for money, or beg for anything. I am here to contribute, to earn my happiness with my hands. What could be wrong with that? I think I am the one who is Pershing the American Dream here, and so do a lot of other F-1 foreign students. We fit in well and we prove ourselves to be useful, please also pay us back. Not food, no money, but a piece of certificate which allows us to keep working...
