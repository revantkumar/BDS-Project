I think this rule is very reasonable and helpful not only for the international students but also for our universities and industries. 
First of all, it will definitely attract more talented students to our universities. Not only will it give the universities a diversified and international environment but also will help the research progresses there, especially in the graduate programs. These international students are mostly top students from the universities back in their countries. They went through all the tests and exams with a different language and they also need to pay far more tuition fees than the native students.They are the disadvantage part in this country who is proud of its role as the place where to get the most advanced knowledge. Most of the time, it's not because the positions are taken over by these international students but because the native students don't want to spend time or energy on subjects that many people tell them would be difficult. For those native students who do have a great passion for these majors, they are doing very good jobs and most of them are very successful in their careers. So I don't think the international students are taking the jobs away from Americans. They are just filling in the vacancies where our native students don't want to go without putting an effort. Protectionism here will not increase the native students' number in the graduate program, it will only impair America's ability to stay ahead in the fast developments of all kinds of technologies.
For these companies who need more professional people like master or even Ph.D students, they will have ton of work piled up if they can only hire the natives. And if these companies do hire some international students, they need some time (not a short one nowadays) to train them so that they could start to perform their jobs. Short period of OPT will only diminish the students' training and also leave these companies no time to gain profit in return.
