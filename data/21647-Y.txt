I strongly support the OPT extension. 

First of all, a great number of International students are working in different realms under OPT, many of them did not have chances to be chosen in the H1B lottery. If they do not have the OPT extension, the company, the realm, even the U.S. economics will be in panic.

Furthermore, OPT and its extension is the most attractiveness for International students, which is the main reason that U.S. universities have a large number of applications each year. If the OPT extension is cancelled, thousands of institutes will be affected in enrollment, which will be a great loss for academy.
