JUN ZHOU I support the new bill if I consider for the US citizens. First, the greatness of United States depends on generations and generations of F-1 students, these foreigners are the most talented and creative people from the original countries, the US should have the policy to keep the best ones among them in the US. Second, most jobs taken by these F-1 students are the ones there are not enough US citizens to fill, so these jobs should and have to be taken by these people. Third, all these people have a relatively higher education and should have less chance to bring crime and social disorder behavior to our society. The US definitely should have the policy to keep these good people in the US.
