Is USA still a OPEN country with OPEN-minded people carrying OPEN culture?

I never doubt it. 

If we close the door for these hard-studying and hard-working students today, we are not far from closing some other doors for every one. Without mentioning the enormous economic value created by these students, the huge contributions in the innovation and ground breaking research done by them are so inspiring. We need these new fresh blood to exist in every engineering fields in our country.

Competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing. I'd like to say it is even a thing that we are eager for. Bringing this big country a new great future, we need more diversity and more competition to make everything run.
