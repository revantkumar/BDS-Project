Here this comment support the policy for the following reasons:

(1) Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China-HK are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. Which means if US does not publish any attractive policy, the high technology employees will be diverged into other more attractive countries and lose this long-term expert-import combat.

(2) Toward general notice that this policy will average salary to a lower level, it should be point out that there are existing policy that a minimum salary should be reached for each international student if they want to land a job at US. Thus this "lower-salary" perspective is unsupported by the existing rules.

(3) If this extension is not published, the rejecting international students might increase the short-term job market by somehow or relief job-finding for some portion of US citizen. However, the cost of this short-term effect will be the benefits of US citizen and it will also cause US to lose ground to the countries that apply a technical-immigrant welcoming policy.
