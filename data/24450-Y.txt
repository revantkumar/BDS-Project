I support this regulation even though I no longer need a OPT now. I now get a full-time job and just lauch a new program for my boss that he said would be a huge breakthrough for the company. It was OPT that gave me a chance that I deserved to intern in this company and made my contribution. I am just so confused where so many Americans are against this policy. Giving international students a fair chance that they should have had so many years ago really necessarily means jeopardizing domestic workers' rights? If so, then this would be a ridiculous dichotomy. Isn't the spirit that Americans are proud of calling for the same play field but not the same consequences? If you are a boss, would you hire someone only base on its nationality instead of their skils and competence for jobs? Not to mention international students and American students are not in the same playfield at all. We pay astronomical tuition and is impossible to get scholarship just because of our citizenship. And even when we graduate, we cannot get a job because employers prefer domestic students when they are less competent. We have to work super hard and develop better skills to get OPT. This just OPT, not even a full-time offer!!! Why are you guys trying to take even OPT away from us?
