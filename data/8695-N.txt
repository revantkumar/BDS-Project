This is unfair to American senior citizens who have worked hard all their lives only to see another hole poked into the Social Security Trust Fund!

Why is this so unfair?

1. It allows foreigners to work in America with a free ride by not paying their fair share when it comes to payroll taxes.

2. It is also unfair to young Americans who are being unlawfully discriminated against due to their "National Origin".

3. It lets employers off the hook because they don't have to make the matching contributions to Social Security and Medicare due to employing a foreign worker whose exempt from payroll taxes.

4. It's unfair to working parents who have paid a lot of money towards their child's education only to see them put out of work by unfair "tax exempt" foreign competition.
