I would say YES to this proposed rule. This is not only because of my identification, an international STEM major grad, but also following concerns.

1. USA has been a country which embraces diversity for more than 200 yeas. In the past two centuries, Americans as well as foreign immigrants create the prosperity of USA. In this era of IT revolution, STEM related field develops really fast. America and American people need more creative brains to help America.

2. International students contribute much more than average, especially in STEM related areas. A strong proof is that international students are earning more than the average salary. The existence of STEM students in US actually accelerate the developing of USA. So why not extend the OPT?

Thanks.
