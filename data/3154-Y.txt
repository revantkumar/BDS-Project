Alex Hong I SUPPORT the OPT extension for STEM students.

1. International students who spend years in American colleges should have a chance to work in USA for at least some amount of time. This is benefit for the economy of the US. Imaging how hard these students study in universities, and how powerful their knowledge would be in the global competition.

2. Students in STEM subjects could contribute to American economy more directly, which I thought as a major reason for them to have an OPT extension. Most of these students would work as engineers in high-tech companies or scientists in research affiliations; these are the brightest brains in the world, what a loss would be if they all go back one year after graduation.

3. Some people may say these international students would take jobs which belong to American citizens. Well, I admit they do take some jobs but they would create even more. They propose new ideas, invent new technologies and set up start-ups, which would create more jobs than they take. THEY ARE THE CATALYST FOR AMERICAN ECONOMY, THEY WOULD CREATE MORE THAN THEY TAKE.

4. As an international students myself, a potential 27 months working opportunity is one of the major reason for me to choose the US. I would feel some regret (or maybe betrayed) if this policy is cancelled when I am still in university.
