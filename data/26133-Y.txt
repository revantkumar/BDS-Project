I support this extention because it is good for America's economy. 1. The most talented students will be staying and make contributions to their work, which is always the best for the employers. 2. If it is approved, more international students will apply for universities here, solving the problem of the shortage in applicants. Universities will have more money to run their projects. 3. More people means more consumers, keeping every part of economy thrive.
