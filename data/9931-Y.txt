I strongly support this! I have many Asian classmates in my Computer Science department, and they are talents! If They are not able to extend their OPT, the states will lose a lot of high-tech talents! They are not the ones who try to enjoy everything here but do thing for it, but those who have the ability to contribute a lot to our nation.
