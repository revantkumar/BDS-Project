William Fan As a experienced employee in my company, I want to reflect what really happens in my company. I have to say that though the native workers are enthusiastic and can easily get involved to the company, the real key works are mostly done by the aliens. The alien employees from STEM who are very smart and hardworking, they can usually come up with great ideas in solving the technical problem. They have solid background knowledge and are very eager to learn. They put work into a more important role in their life than the american worker. I don't mean the native workers' attitude are not good. However, I think that our company would prefer the workers who are more willing to contribute them to our company. Some guys enrolled this year are suffering the trouble due to this policy change and I hope my opinion can help them staying and contributing to my company.
