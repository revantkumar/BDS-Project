As an international statistics major master student, I strongly support this new opt extension rule. I came to the US last year and will graduate this december. The reason that I want to study abroad is to learn the higher level knowledge as well as to get more advanced work experience. Finally I chose the US, instead of UK or any other countries because of the 29 months opt for international stem major students. So do most of my classmates. We are so surprised that the extension might be canceled at the time that we are gonna to graduate! We even feel that we are deceived by the government! If it was canceled, there must be a huge decrease in the number of students who would like to come here for study!
