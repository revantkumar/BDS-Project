I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge in US universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the United States.
2. Diversity is very important for US. Many achievements are made from figures who used to be the international students. Like several Nobel prizes winners, Chen-Ning Franklin Yang, Tsung-Dao Lee, and also the creater of Opticals communications, Charls Kao.
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. The truth is that there are many positions in US are not suited for the natives. Many transnational corporations need to hire a large amount of international workers to keep its competitiveness.
