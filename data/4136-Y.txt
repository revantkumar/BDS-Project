Extended OPT helps workers focus on their current work, rather than look for alternatives

I have a friend working at Google with OPT. He is a very smart young man graduated from UC Berkeley. However, he cannot fully contribute his skills and knowledge to the work. Why? That is because his OPT is going to expire in several months (he just graduated this year). Instead to enjoying working at Google, he has to spend a lot of time preparing GRE and trying to apply for graduate school in order to stay in U.S. 
He is not the only one. If OPT gets extended, more workers on OPT can concentrate on their work, and make contribution to the company and the country. And I think that's why we want to grant OPT to students - we need their contribution to the country. But first of all, we should give them time and opportunity to do so, especially if they are talented.

Several months' OPT makes everyone feel unsafe and have to look for alternatives rather than work for long-term contribution. 

If our goal is to retain highly educated young people and let them contribute to the industry, we should at least give their more time and more opportunity to stay. 

If a student graduating from Berkeley and working at Google cannot stay due to the short OPT period, I think we need to make the change and EXTEND the OPT.
