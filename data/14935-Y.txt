I highly support the new proposal.
As a person who came from China, pursued Master degree in Electrical Engineering and is currently working in United States, this proposed STEM policy provides obvious benefit both to the employers and potential employees. When I was in in NCSU graduate school, I saw many excellent non-US students making multiple times of efforts than US students just to find a job, although there are plenty of positions posting on website. The reason for this phenomenon is simple, only limited employers will support the foreign employees for the H1-B visa. It is not only the extra cost issue, it is also the risk that the employee might not win the H1-B "lottery", which will force the company to lose this employee.

If this proposal can be passed, the employer can have the potential to keep the employee for at least 36 months, which equals to the period of H1-B visa. In most of the EE or CE companies, 36-month period is plenty to finish at least one project.

For non-US employees, this policy will also bring much flexibility. They will be less worried with their working visa while they are working. They could pay more attention on what they are working on, which will potentially make more productivity and contribution to the employer.

To conclude, this proposal benefits to both non-US employees and employers.
