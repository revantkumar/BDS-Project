This improvement is definitely excellent for not only international students but also for the whole us society. As we all know that America is a diversity community. It is consisted by people from all over the world. This quality attracts lots of people from all over the world, including me-an international student from China, come to America to study. Cause we all think that America culture will choose to accept us not to exclude us. This time extension is good sign for us since it will give us more opportunities in America to completely show what we can do for this society. For America people, they may think that this OPT will make them lose their job, but I think this OPT can elevate the sense of competition which will help stimulate working efficiency. That's all I want to say. I believe America will afford a fair response for all our international people who trust this society will give them a chance to perform, to pay back to this society.
