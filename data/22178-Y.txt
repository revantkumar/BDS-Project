1. American is a justic and lawful country. Chance should be fair for everyone. International students spend lots of money to study in USA and spend years to involve into the American culture. It is reasonable to offer them much more time to contribute to the American construction as well as learn from this country.
2. STEM is the most lack part of current America. these kind of students are most needed for American development. In addition, these kinds of students are trained in the American education system, so they can more easily to join themsevles to the American working set.
