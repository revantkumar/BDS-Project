I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S., especially for those who are in STEM majors.

2. Diversity is very important in U.S.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International students are not stealing jobs. They are actually fitting positions that most of the American couldn't or wouldn't take. It's a win-win situation for U.S. in this case because companies doen't have to worry about not having the right person in the specitial positions.
