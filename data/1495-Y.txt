Yuntao Ou I strongly support this new OPT extension policy. This can benefit both US STEM industry, and international students.
1. International students are great support for the STEM industry. Giving them 24 months OPT extension can have them making great contribution. Look at Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, etc., the smartphone, the computer they make, and the services they provide. Without international students, these may not be happening today. Furthermore, even as F-1 student, every dollar they earn will still need to pay tax to the IRS, and then it also make benefit to every US citizen.
2. F-1 students can also gain enough industrial practice for what they have learned in classroom with the 24 months OPT extension. In addition, because they learned in the US, getting industrial training in the US is the best match for them.
3. US tech company would only consider international students if they can't hire US citizens that meet the company's requirement. US citizens always have their priority if they have strong skill set.
