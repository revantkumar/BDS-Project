The doors to the opportunities should not be closed to honest, hard working people merely because where they were born or their races. OPT extension is one important step towards fixing the immigration system. We hope to see more and bigger steps.

I graduated with a PhD degree from an American university last year, and I am extremely grateful for the education I received and the life I had over the last six years. However, due to the increasing amount of H1B visa application, I was not selected in the lottery this year. Without OPT, I will be forced to leave my current job and leave my fiancee behind. 

A lot of my friends who received advanced degrees from American universities are troubled by the visa problem. On the one hand, they are grateful to be able to acquire top-notch knowledge and skills through their education program. On the other hand, some of these knowledge and hardworking will simply be wasted because the work in related field is not as advanced in their home countries. 

So besides taking majors into consideration, I would also hope US immigration system find more creative ways to offer a little more opportunities to those with advanced degrees from US universities so that they can continue to work at their best levels. Nurturing and keeping young talents were the reason US become the No. 1 country in the work, let's not reverse this process in the future.
