In the US, there are not many citizens in STEM, especially in the graduate school. The big companies cannot find the qualified US citizens in the fields. That's why the international students are so important to fill in the positions and serve for the companies in these fields. I think OPT extension is really required not only for the international students, but also significantly important to US economy and the future. This will not influence the job market for the US citizens.
