Sharon McNeil The proposed rule is a huge advancement for US education industry and IT industry. 
For higher education, international students often pay out-of-state tuition ranging from 10K to 60K per year. A sizable number of universities do rely on international students' tuition to support funding. If these highly-skilled international STEM students can only have 12 months of working permit after graduation, I highly doubt if they would choose US as the place for higher education. 
On the other side, IT industry has long been demanding more engineers and scientists. Instagram founder Mike Krieger went to Stanford on F1 visa and used his OPT after graduation. In 2010, he co-founded Instagram in US. Turning down STEM-OPT Extension for thousands of STEM students are pushing potential entrepreneurs, innovators and diligent tax-payers out of America. 
In summation, I believe the proposed rule should be accepted as a final rule.
