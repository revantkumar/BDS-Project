I support OPT new extension rule!
The numbers used to oppose OPT is ridiculous. In 2014, F1 students brought 27 billions to economic impact to the US. The unemployment from 2009-2013 claimed is nothing to do with OPT. If OPT extension is canceled, it will be detrimental to the US education sector because American education is not that attractive any more. Driving away talented skilled international professionals could not create more opportunities to the Americans because not all unemployed natives are able to take these jobs in science and high-tech industries. Being open is the way to bring prosperity.
