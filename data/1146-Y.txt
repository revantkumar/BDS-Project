I am writing to support expanding the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. In many STEM fields, if one chooses to pursue research (for instance, with a PhD degree), one needs to complete a postdoctoral position, which usually lasts somewhere between 1 year to 3 years. Unfortunately, most institutions formally state that they do not sponsor work visas for post-doctoral positions, thus making it impossible for foreign graduates to attain such opportunities without risking losing their legal status in the United States. This disadvantage puts many talented scholars and researchers in a difficult position, and forces them to choose careers outside the United States. I personally know many individuals that moved to Europe or Asia to pursue postdoctoral training opportunities and research positions for this reason. Therefore I support expanding the training period for F-1 students after graduation.
