I strongly support the regulation.

In the definition of the American Dream by James Truslow Adams in 1931, "life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement" regardless of social class or circumstances of birth.

If the majority of a country is trying to protect their employment opportunities only by excluding minority from equal competition, they are violating the dreams which have been built by their forefathers. The only upright way to reinforce our dreams is to make our young men and women more competitive to build our country by their hands instead of waiting for regulations to protect them.
