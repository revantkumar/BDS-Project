Philip Stone With all of the problems of unemployment here is the United States I find in rather unproductive to be giving the opportunity to immigrants, over citizens, to come into the country and what amounts do nothing to improve the employment of citizens. There is more than one reason for this rule change to not go into effect. It appears that for the American economy to improve it should be Americans that are giving any assistance.
OPT has denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs from 2009-2013 and has also been responsible for more than 4 billion dollars not going to Social Security and Medicare.
Training is fine as long as the original purpose of the program is followed and the trainees return to the home countries and help improve the homeland.
Employers should be required to pay FICE and Medicare taxes for the trainees.
Keep the high paying jobs in the country with American citizens and not foreign students.
