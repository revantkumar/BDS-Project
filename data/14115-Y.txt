I am a manager in one of the finance company in California. When I saw this new rule for nonimmigrant students, I feel it would be a very nice thing to us. In my company, each team will work on different project, and most of our project are not able to finish in two years. I have lost two employee this year who graduated from graduate school, but they both didn't get the H1B visa due to the lottery. This is a big loss to my team. When they were here, project went smoothly, they are very efficient and can deliver results quickly. However since they left, my project was delayed and I have to spend another 3 months to hire new people to fill in the gap. 

And I feel sorry for those two students. They are very diligent, smart, and knowledgeable. They deserve to at least see their project finish. I root for OPT extension!
