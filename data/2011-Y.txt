Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate international student at the one of the university in united states. There are many international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. All the people like me will be strongly benefitted by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. I am planning to use OPT after graduation to gain practical training experience in the US because it will help me in learning practical scenarios in the market. OPT and OPT extension is important to be because a international student can get exposure only by good amount of practical training.

I am very concerned with the possibility about students to making use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I recommend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students. All international students need support of this OPT to enhance their lerning by doing masters in united states.

Thanks and Regards
