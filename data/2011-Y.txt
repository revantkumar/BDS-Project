The extension can really help some industry in U.S like information technology. With OPT extention, foreign students majoring in STEM can stay for like one or two years to help do researches, benefit domestic industries and so on. Local students still have the advantages over those foreign students when they try to find a related job. It is always a good thing to reserve one or two years of most young and smart people by offering OPT extensions.Thank you!
