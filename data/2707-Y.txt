This is insane; and a repudiation of the hopes of we middle class U.S. citizens, that "OUR" government actually has our best interest at heart! We MUST reduce, even legal, immigration; and particularly work visas of almost every category. You must not listen to the major universities and employers, they are not the majority for whom you exist. We do not, and will not likely ever have, one big happy, borderless, world. You "elites" are actually fools to think so, even though you think you see only gain for yourselves, and believe you are also being progressive, modern and compassionate. PLEASE START THINKING OF THE MAJORITY OF U.S. CITIZENS, or you will be responsible for the chaos that results. We Democratic-voting people see something in the "tea-party" type concerns of Trump, etc., and there are very many of us. Please re-think your position.
