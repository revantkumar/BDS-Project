I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The privilege of being a STEM student is one of the most important factor to attract foreign students coming to the U.S. Especially for Chinese students because most of Chinese students are good at math, science and engineering. Every year, there are a lot of Chinese students come to US, pursuing advanced education and exploring their potential in related field. The huge amount of tuition they pay for the school definitely helps the economics grow. 

2. Among these international students who earned the opportunities studying in the US, a lot of them are really talented people. Why dont give these talented people a chance to work here and make contribution to this country.

3. Most of those people who actually immigrated successfully, do not come from an advanced educational background. Some of them can stay here because they are rich, some of them stay here even their visa get expired, some of them stay here because they married with a citizens. To be frankly, if people do have problem with immigration, why not go against with people who contribute less to the country?
