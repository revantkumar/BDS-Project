In turn, the national production those international new grads create has non-negligible importance to the industry, citizens' life and national prosperity. STEM grads who needs to take advantage of the OPT extension usually make up the foundation of those technical companies will regretlessly and diligently fix those concrete and detailed jobs. They are analogous to small screws of the huge machine. Without the existence of those screws, the machine will fall apart. To illustrate this statement, let see some examples in IT industry. Nowadays, large portion of IT grads are Indians and Chinese and they are responsible for the core part of many companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. It's not an uncommon scenario that they often work overtime to maintain the servers, databases and design and implement functionality of existed software or service. Some can argue that first tier talented people can stay in US by EB1 visa. But one cannot deny the production competence of a country or the prosperity of the country largely depends on the strong middle class and those STEM grads are quite qualified for the middle class category. Not only OPT extension benefits both party of STEM grads and the states, but only those decently paid grads contribute a significant amount of income salary. The immediate benefit resulted from OPT extension increases government revenue and raise the funding for the government to do more charitable executions. All in all, OPE extension is mutual beneficial and there is no strong reasons that lead the states to deny such proposal.
