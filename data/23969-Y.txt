Strongly support to change STEM Extension from 17 month to 24. This will not just good for the international students, it will also benefits universities, cities's economy and also a lot the employer around this country. 

Universities around the states are you admitting so many internationals every year. Most of these students from all over the world are paying the expensive out of state tuition and fees and international fees. The money from all international students help universities to do research, to buy new computers, to get more books and overall, provide better education to US's next generation. Don't forget the international students contribution here. If, all of the student cannot get the proper OPT after their education, US higher education's value is absolutely getting a huge discount. No doubt that more and more international will choose other countries other than US for higher education. 

Many college cities economy benefit a lot from the international students. Look at Champaign Urbana in Illinois, West Lafayette in Indiana and many many other cities like this. Growing international students and provide this cities booming growth in economy. 

Employers around the states are also looking for hiring international students. Internationals bring in new blood to the companies. You might not want to admit this, but most of the internationals work harder than Americans. Increasing the STEM Extension will provide the company more opportunities in finding a good employee. 

To conclude, I highly support increasing the STEM extension period from 17 months to 24.
