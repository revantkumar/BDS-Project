I think the extending time of OPT will attract more smart people to study and work in America. They can apply what they have learned in America to work and contribute to American economies. What's more, if the time of STEM major is reduced, more people will tend to choose Indian or some European country to go undergraduate education or gred education for the lower tuition and fee there.
