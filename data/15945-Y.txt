I STRONGLY AGREE that STEM major students should have extensions.

1. The United States is the one that which emphasizes equal opportunities for different people. International students are not using low wages to steal the opportunities from Americans. In contrast, for example, there is minimum wages requirements for international students who need to apply H1-B. 

2. As the trend shows, skilled immigrants do contribute a lot to the United States. Without permitting extend the time for these people staying, it will directly impacts on the US economy.

Therefore I strongly agree this regulation.
