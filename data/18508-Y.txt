I strongly support this decision for several reasons:
1. America is a place where all racial are accepted and everyone are given equal chances. Students who come to America to get further deserve longer time to get prepared and to find their opportunities.
2. Students who are able to get to American Universities and graduate may always have their own strong point, and if they have longer time to find an appropriate status in this society, this country will be able to get more talented people to help to develop it's society and to make people's life quality increase.
3. OTP means more chances for international students and therefore means great attractive toward talented students therefore the pass of OTP will attract more human resources who can bring positive effect to both the American education system but also to the society.
