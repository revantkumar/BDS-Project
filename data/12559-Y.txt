If American government cancels the cpt-ext, there will be a big gap in available employees for American companies, and thus produce a negative influence in American economy. Besides, allowing cpt-ext does not mean reduce the work opportunities for Americans. Most of F1 studnts just want to have this opportunity to practice their real-work working skills and after they have some experiences in their filed, they will come back to their home countries, so they won't occupy Americans' positions.
