I see a lot of negative comments insanely ignoring some simple facts. It is absolutely not true that international students from certified universities are cheap labors. In fact, after spending a large amount of money in education (and living expenses) and several years on advanced study, international students are always seeking for the best opportunities, just the same as native Americans. I myself is an Oracle employee who is currently on 17 month OPT extension. As my OPT is going to expire on December 25th this year, I am anxiously looking forward to seeing this 24 month rule getting finalized. This is going to give me another 7 months to finish my current 2-year long project at Oracle. Admittedly, the optimal length of OPT extension for each individual is debatable. Judging from my own experience, 24 month extension seems to be a reasonable length for a new college graduates to get adapt to work and accomplish 1~2 projects.
