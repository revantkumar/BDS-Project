i support Stem OPT Extension. Students need work experience to enhance their career. America Should not make education a business by inviting students to the country make billions of dollars out of them and send them back...
America is a land of opportunity, Its students dream to be here. If you really have talent america will show you a way. please come out of the myth that international students are stealing your jobs and killing America. They in fact are spending billions of dollars every year through fees, Taxes, Rents and other stuff like mobile bills..etc. The amount that they are spending through their fees is approx 10 billion dollars every year and other expenses is approx 5 billion dollars and moreover they are being part of the countries GDP.That's lot of money...
Its funny that people are feeling bad that they are ruining their careers. If you are educated you will get a job. please remember only 40% of Americans are educated. You have good schools, universities and best education system but still its 40% education rate is that their fault???
They need proper practical training to master what they have learnt after spending so much of money and time...

Most importantly international students are not illegal immigrants.They are here to study and learn through practical training....

God bless America......
we love america......
