I absolutely ENDORSE the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of the STEM OPT. As an international student, one of the most attractive part of studying in the US is that it allows students with STEM major can have some optional practical training time after graduate. Otherwise, why don't I study in some other countries in Europe since they have a much lower tuition fees. 

In addition, it is also important for US companies to have a diversity especially companies with international business. Only people from that certain country have a deep understanding of the culture. International students can help companies avoid some mistakes related to cultures and offer more ideas from a different perspective.

OPT extension is beneficial for US companies also because companies don't have to worry about that international students have to leave the companies within one year just because they cannot get either H1B or OPT extension. It will be huge loss to US companies since they have to repeat the hiring process and may not find the fit people.

After all, I SUPPORT this proposal since it's great for both international students and US companies.
