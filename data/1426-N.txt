American graduates are having a difficult time finding work now. Over 50% of STEM graduates now cannot find work. These American students are morgaging their future with student loans and the government is undercuting their ability to find a job when they graduate. Foreign students filling these jobs lowers wages and displaces American workers. 

Claims that there is a shortage of Americans to do these jobs are false. If there was a shortage of workers wages would be on the rise and there would be full employment of American graduates. Stop all visas and programs until all Americans are working.
