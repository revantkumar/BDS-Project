Gordon Rees International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership and quantitative skills. Americans who engaged with international students while on campus are more likely in later life to appreciate art and literature, place current problems in historical perspective and read or speak a foreign language as per survey from duke university.
