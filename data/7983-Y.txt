What do Googles Sergey Brin, eBays Pierre Omidyar, and Tesla Motorss Elon Musk all have in common? They were born outside the U.S. and immigrated to the U.S. Some of the greatest companies are created by immigrants.From Yahoo to Facebook and LinkedIn, each of these innovative companies had at least one founder that was born abroad and then emigrated to the United States.
