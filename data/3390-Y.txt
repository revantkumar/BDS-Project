I live in Florida and rented my old house to some lovely international students. They pay their rent on time, they clean the house, they never got me into any trouble. I doubt if I can still find renters like this if our government shut down this extension thing and we lose those students to Canada or European countries. Those nice Chinese and Indian students brought me enough profits to support myself in another state, so I strongly support this extension plan.
