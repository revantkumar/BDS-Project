I am happy to see this proposal. There are tons of international students in STEM graduating every year. They are intelligent and hard-working, and they can create more job opportunities for others. Thus, it is beneficial to temporarily keep them in the United States contributing to science, technology, and the community. I look forward to the approval of this proposal.
