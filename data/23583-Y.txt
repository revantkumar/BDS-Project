I don't think visa extension will do harm to US workers. Statistics, Computer Science, Engineers, I don't think any of these majors will be their favorite choice. If you the government only give STEM students 1 year OPT, I don't think it's still appealing to me. I won't consider Statistics at all, because I won't be able to find a job anyway. I can choose something easier, only need to read some papers, no calculus, no liner regression, no ANOVA, MANOVA, ANOCOVA. For people who's major is not statistics, they won't be able to understand the pain.

As Chinese, we got giros training when we were little. Before we enter college, everything needs to be calculated by hand, no calculators. I don't see any other counties can do that. If the government give them 2 years extension, they have more Probability to choose a STEM major, which will contribute a lot to this country.
