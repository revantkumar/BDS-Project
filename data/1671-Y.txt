I strongly SUPPORT this rules for the following reasons;
1. International students who received education in America deserve the opportunity to make contributions to the society. 
2. International students are at a disadvantage in finding a job. They only can get jobs when their abilities are much higher than other native competitors. Therefore more international students in an industry field will surely increase the strength of this field of America.
