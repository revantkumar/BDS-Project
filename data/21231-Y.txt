I strongly support it! I believe America is a country emphasizing human right. Everyone is equal and must have an equal right to compete with others. Giving international students two more years to work in the U.S. could contribute to American economy. This extension is not an infinite one, so how could it affect works of American people? And companies hiring international students are mostly small companies, which need relatively low-price labor. Without international students, it's hard for them to sustain.
Also, America is a nation of immigrants. The boundaries between American and non-American are not that clear. Why treat us, the first generation entering America differently?
