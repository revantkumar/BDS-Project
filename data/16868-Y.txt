I strongly support the STEM students OPT extension program!!

All the STEM students in the US have contributed hugely to this country without asking anything else but respect! The technological immigrants are not "stealing" work opportunities from the US citizens but completing the engineering jobs that the citizens won't do. 

The most popular dream jobs in the US are attorneys, football players, actors, doctors. Are these STEM related??
