I strongly support extending the OPT to 36 months. It will help STEM students and me to discover our futures in the U.S. I haven been studying in the U.S. for over 7 years and absolutely love here. After graduation, I want to work here. Nowadays, both corporates and start-ups need diversity to fit business culture. In addition, STEM students are able to provide technical skills, such as programming, data analytic and product management, key tasks helping a company gaining profit. Imagine that, how Google, Apple, Facebook will be without us? We will only benefit the country!
