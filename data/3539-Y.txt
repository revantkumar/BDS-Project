I strongly support this proposal. 
Think about this. The economy of this country depended, depends, and will depend on immigrants. There is simply no conflict of interest between high tech workers and US citizens. Google founder, Facebook founder, those famous physicists who helped defeat German army, the President's father...The talented people and smart people are key to this country's prosperity and stability, and the competitive edge against other nations. 
Extension of OPT will give those talents and smart people sufficient time to stand out and start a business, develop a lot of new technologies. These outcomes will greatly enhance the economy that all US citizens will benefit from. In addition, they do not occupy jobs that most US citizens do, and it is temporary, and if they are not outstanding they will leave the country anyways.
