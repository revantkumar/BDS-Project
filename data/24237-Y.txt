I strongly SUPPORT the proposal and no see any of the points to prevent its approval.

The strongest voice against OPT extension is international student took the job positions that should supposed belong to US citizens, I personally against this for the reasons of following:

First of all, the international students didn't take their Jobs, based on my experience before, the employer in United States are fair enough to recruit anyone with same background, we can even say they are more tend to employ native citizen because the company don't need to pay large amount of sponsor fees and don't need to afraid they can't serve for long time bases. The disadvantage only a lot more for International students hunting for jobs.

Second, Diversity is very important for the US, and probably the most important reason why US has been so much success in the past 50 years. Jew, Chinese, Indian, their forces formed an unignorable power and strength. The United states now rely on its basic research power and service professionals, all of these fields have many many researchers coming from China, India and many parts of the world.

Third, F1 is not the only way can let international student coming and work in US, there are many types of visas J, H, based on I know 75% of my classmates just going back to China after they graduated, in here, we paid for tuitions, and learned knowledge and skills, these part has nothing to do with taken anyone's job in US, I didn't see any of the Points that ONLY STUDENT TOOK AMERICANS JOBS.

THANKS FOR CONSIDERING ABOVE.
