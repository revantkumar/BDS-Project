I strongly support this rule because it can benefit both the colleges and industry company. For college, this rule can attract more students come to US for their study, and therefore, make US colleges to be the best. For industry company, this rule will allow those smart, hard-working STEM students work for them, and make the profits. Don't worry about the job opportunity for Americans because STEM students are only hired by companies if they can not find American candidates.
