I do NOT think extending the OPT for STEM major is a fair and right decision.

First of all, this is way too unfair for non-STEM major students, who accounts for a large source of tuition income for universities and colleges. If the extension passes, it means that STEM students might have more chances to get the lotteries, so that the ones who didn't get an H1B quota will roll over to next year, and as a result, the chances of non-STEM majors could win a lottery is even lower.

Secondly, extending OPT for STEM would cause more problem to the society as a whole. Extending OPT itself is okay, but a direct result of this is that more STEM students will be able to get a H1B and in turn a green card later. This will not only cause series problems due to immigration, but also will make less American willing to study STEM majors and make the relevant industries dominated by aliens.

To sum it up, extending OPT for STEM is NEVER gonna be a right decision!
