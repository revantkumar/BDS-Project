I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
First of all, when I studied the history of the Unite States, I found lots of scientist, such as Einstein, who born in other country made a considerable contribution to this country.
Secondly, if you can't offer enough time for international, they would go back to other country to do the same thing and it will shake the strength of this country.
