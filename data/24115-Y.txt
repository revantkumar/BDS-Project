I am an instructor of JAVA and maximum of my students are international, I have seen their knowledge and almost all of my student are in touch with me. I know how hard it is for them to get job in US market in comparison to US citizen. Many of them need to return to their home country because of not getting selected for H1 and they couldn't even earn enough money that they have spent for getting education in US. This rule gives enough time to those student to at least prove them selves. That's why I support this rule and we all should.
