I came to the U.S. 5 years ago to study computer science. As a woman in this field, it was very rare. When I was in college, I paid 3 times as what a regular person would pay, since I couldn't get any financial aid, plus I had to pay the international students fee(out-state fee). 
As international students- we pay so much to go to college here in the states. We learn & try to use our knowledge we get to help the economy in the states! If you kick us out the country - then less and less people would want to be in the U.S. to get educated. 
Do we take the jobs over domestic graduates? No, absolutely not! Job opportunities are equal, why do we get the jobs, others aren't? It's because most of the kids here, they don't work as hard, or can't qualify. One of the students who graduated with me, he is still home, not having a job. We went to college together, get the exactly same degree. Why cannot him find a job after a year? 1- He is not trying hard, he goes to play somewhere else everyday instead of applying for jobs. 2- He just doesn't qualify, he was barely passing the classes in college. When I was in college, I worked part time in school 20 hours per week, plus taking all the extra units of classes. Are the kids in the states do the same? Rarely! They go home- play games, do something else, they get the tuitions cover by financial aid, but we don't! 
We work extremely hard to get educations here in U.S., now we just want to use our knowledge to help the companies and economy. But U.S. wants to send us back home, and use our intelligence to help the other counties instead theirs?!?! Come on! You need to be smart!
