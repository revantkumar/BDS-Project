Passing the new rule is very important to US because of the following reasons.

1. It's one of American basic spirits that everyone deserves equal opportunities to chase their dreams. The proposed new rule allow STEM students to develop necessary skills to complete in this international talent market.

2. A lot of high-tech companies in US rely heavily on STEM graduates to fill in positions and make innovations to boost US technological advances.

3. If the new rule were to be revoked, these highly-skilled talents would have to return to their own country and work for competitors. This would be a huge loss to US since they obtained their higher education from US.

Based on the reasons listed above, I will give my full support in passing the proposed rule on OPT STEM extension and hope US government would take serious considerations in protecting and supporting STEM graduates in broader spectrum.
