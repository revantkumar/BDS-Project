I believe non immigrant stem students should be able to work in U.S. Longer under OPT. This will pave way for them to contribute more to the economy as well as to scientific community. Most of the higher educated people are going to find careers else where in the world too , but U.S. Should set up rules regulations in such a way , that they will contribute more to US and be part of the intelligent community here
