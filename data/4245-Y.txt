I'm strongly rooted for this policy. It will be a win-win situation for both domestic industry and foreign STEM students who study in the USA. First of all, the training opportunities this policy provides is a critical advantage that the USA possesses over other countries like GB and Australia. I believe it is one of the most important aspects, if not the most important aspect, that many students would consider when they decide their study destinations. It's almost certain that the discontinuation of the policy will drive away many prospect students, which will for sure make a real dent in USA's talent pool. Second, as the continuation of the academic education, students will need these opportunities to hone and practice the skills they learn in class to become true assets for the society. Besides, I think the concern or even fear on the potential harm this policy will do to the labor market is exaggerated and rather irrational because what really controls how many foreign people could remain in the market is the H1B visa quota and it obviously has not been even touched by this policy at all.
