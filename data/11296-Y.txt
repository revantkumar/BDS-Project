To those people who object this regulation:

Do you really care about American future?
Do you really understand who are those STEM students?

Some people object the regulation because they think government places foreigner over U.S. citizen.
What are you thinking? No government will place general foreigners over its own citizen if they have same skill.
We need to keep those STEM students because they are the most talent people in the world.
They will contribute to this country more than you thought. If you want to kick them out, think that you are kicking out the PhDs working with the most advanced technology graduated from the top universities like Harvard, MIT, stanford, etc.
