I do support this extension. Since international students (especially student from STEM majors) receive very good trainings from schools in U.S., and most of them may have the support from US institutions/agencies. It is absolutely important to and fair to give these students an opportunity, with which they could use the skills and experience gained in school to make more contributions to US and the world.
