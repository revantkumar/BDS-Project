It is unbelievable that all these policy makers caved in to businesses who claim that they cannot find US citizens who can do the job. I have been a business owner for 30 years. I came to realize that a business depends on foreign student workers would not survive. Those foreign student workers are not worth what they are paid. In the mean time, it perpetuated a process that US citizens cannot compete with them. All future administration must stop this madness.
