I think that it is a bad idea to expand the OPT for foreign students to 36 months. I think this is going to be in direct competition to American workers or American graduates who want to find a job. Everyone wants to go to work but I think that Americans should have the right to first chance on these jobs not foreign students or graduates holding these new visas. I just want to say that I think this rule is a bad idea. It is not fair to American citizens graduating in these technical fields that they have competition in hiring from companies that are given incentives to hire foreign graduates for less money. Please do not implement this rule.
