I chosen USA to get my master degree is because it has up to 12+17 months OPT for me to get work experience. I don't want to spend lots of money and then go back home just after gradution. There are few native Amercian in my major and even for the international students, it's very hard to find a job, since most of the company don't want to hire the international students. I really don't know why some people just complaint that we "steal " their jobs? That must be kidding. All the Amercian in my major can find a job easily, the only people without a job are our international students.
