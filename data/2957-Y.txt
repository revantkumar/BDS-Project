YEAH, I strongly support this proposal. Lots of high technology companies and especially IT companies need international students to fill in the positions that americans do not like to take or has no required skills to take. This proposal would greatly lower down the cost of training new employees at very high frequencies, which makes the pricing of the high tech products and services remain low for u.s. consumers. Most americans are consumers in most areas and worker in only one area. So we all hope the pricing for products and services stays low.
