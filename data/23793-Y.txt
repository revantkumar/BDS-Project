I give my strongest possible support for improving and expanding OPT and Cap-Gap relief.

First, foreign students who achieved their education in America have made great contributions to the development of science and technology in America. We can see a remarkable number of foreign graduate students contribute their intelligence and diligence in the leading companies and organizations in information technologies, engineering, and scientific research. We cannot imagine what a great loss we might face if we shut out those young and talented people. 

Secondly, it is the great spirit of America to show everyone equality and freedom. I strongly advocate the rights of foreign students - to have a fair chance to fight for America, making it a better place to live in.
