Hey,

That's the best news I could have ever hear about this issue.I was continously engaging in the news about the life of international students here in Usa.And now this rule is really a golden spoon to them,not for immigrating but for being a part of the wonderful global community.Doesnt matter if they get a green card later or not but working in a global country is really an added advantage.Thanks for Dhs and all the relative govt organizations for this opportunity to all the international students out there in Usa.

God bless America.
