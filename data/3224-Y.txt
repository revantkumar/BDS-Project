Hi all,
I have been in the US for almost 4 years and I am currently studying for my PhD. As an international student living in a foreign country, we go through a lot of hard times that no one can understand unless she/he has gone through the same experience. Being away from home and family is enough to make you less efficient and it makes life harder than it already is for international students. All visa issues that we face (as an Iranian student) and not being able to travel, and have the fear of not being able to come back are all mind boggling facts that we deal with during the time that we study here. Aside from the reason behind each persons decision to come to US to pursue her/his life, the current system is not making it easier, if not harder, for us to be able to focus and perform as students. The only benefit that this new law would have for us is to give us some ease of mind after education and not to worry about our life being %100 dependent on chance of our name being drawn from a lottery. 
I hope every us citizen or green card holder who is commenting on this, realizes the aspects and effects of this on making life a little bit easier and less stressful for a majority of people who are working hard to achieve something in their lives. 

Thank,
Iraninan student
