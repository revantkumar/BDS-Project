The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.
OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. 

Why would you jeopardize senior citizens, the 76% of our own brilliant students with huge college debts. The 
manufactured SO CALLED SHORTAGE IS BALONEY! The Disney techs who were forced to train their replacement AFTER Disney made record profits the year before. This type of greed is sick! This is not necessity. The American public is very angry with this type of graft, corruption and GREED! If you can pass this knowing you are killing the dreams of our young who are loaded with debt, worked for a goal for years only to have OUR VERY OWN GOVERNMENT kill their dreams. Further draining social security for the vulnerable elderly who worked their whole lives paying into this so when they were no longer able to work they would be able to at least eat and have the bare necessities. Please look within yourselves and realize who and what you are harming.
