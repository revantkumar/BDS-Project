I strongly support this proposal and here are the reasons:

1. Students should be provided with a training period to gain and practice their skills. This proposal gives STEM students, who normally need more time to practice and build a project thoroughly, an opportunity to both practice, achieve and contribute.

2. I do not agree with some citizens who complain about the STEM students take away their jobs and I consider STEM students contributors.

First, the STEM students are only legal to work in fixed positions related to their majors in their OPT training program. Not all STEM students could get a job but only the qualified ones.

Second, since STEM students only have limited OPT time, companies apparently prefer citizens to STEM students since they do no need to risk losing employees. But why companies still risk hiring STEM students? Because they there are not enough qualified citizens in STEM related positions. So it is not the STEM students who take away their jobs. I think that kind of citizens prefer to complain here and deprive the opportunities of STEM students instead of working hard to get qualified, which is unhealthy, both for those citizens or this country. 

Third, if I were a citizen, I would consider it a great thing that United States could attract these qualified STEM students to help and contribute to this country. They are great resources which could be used to make United States stronger.

3. As conclusion, this proposal is a win-win both for United States and STEM student. For our country, we can fit the positions with qualified employees. These qualified employees have helped and will help our companies grow larger, which creates more job positions. Since the benefits of STEM OPT are solid but, unfortunately, not apparent, it will be so inadvisable if we give it up. For the STEM students, they can get the opportunity to create something useful and gain experience in real industry.
