I strongly SUPPORT the OPT program. Hi-Tech companies (STEM related industries) are in high demand of employees trained with hi-tech education (no matter international or American, the ONLY thing matters is qualification). OPT wont hurt these companies, instead, itll help benefit the companies and improve Americans economy.
