I support the new rule. This new OPT extension rule should be approved. Giving working permission to international students is beneficial to the US. STEM international students have degrees in science, technology, engineering and math from universities in the US. Many companies in the US are short of talents from these areas. Many international STEM students are working in core departments in high-tech companies and also essential projects in these companies. The huge contribution from international students who received education in the US creates so much benefits and opens more business. If OPT extension were canceled, all these talented people should leave abruptly and this will ABSOLUTELY have a detriment to the employers, big companies, and the US economy. 

Unreasonable voices are heard: many native Americans do not have jobs...jobs should be given to citizens and so on. I would like to say: the unemployment rate is as low as 5% and there's no causality between STEM international students employment and Americans unemployment. Not all unemployed Americans can take those jobs of STEM international students. STEM international students are employed because they are qualified and employers can not find Americans to do the job. If you look at the statistics of students in universities and look at the nationality diversity in STEM majors, you will believe this. 

The OPT extension rule will benefit many aspects including the US education (if you cancel the OPT extension, less international students will come to the US, this will strike the education), employers, and also the public of Americans since their contribution will benefit the US economy.
