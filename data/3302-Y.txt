Lucas Taylor We, as Americans, have lived here as natural born citizens our whole life. We have followed the laws of the land and paid taxes. We have paid taxes to send our children to the public school system and paid to send them to colleges that probably cost us more than the foreigners due to the quotas needed to be filled for the universities. When we get out we should have as much of more of a right as US citizens to earn the available jobs in the STEM markets. The president should NOT be able to allow preference to foreigners for these positions so these lobbying companies can lower the wages and beat down the market as a whole. He would be killing this country and again holding down the American people financially. It is not his right. He does not make laws. DO NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN!!
