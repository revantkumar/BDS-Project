I feel Americans are being neglected by this country by let foreign students and worker to take over our employment and education opportunities. I decide to go back to school after losing my job to farther my ability to have a better job. I did not want to be in debt in going back to school I did apply for grant money and receive it. Planning to returning return back to finish my education applying and finding out the grant was going to students who are not apart of the this country. Giving jobs to foreign workers or students is a down right stupid. Many people are still out of a job including our veterans who have served our country faithfully. We should think about our people who are still are out of work and still looking for job to provide for their families.
