I definitely support the proposal of OPT extension for F-1 nonimmigrant Student with STEM degree. The reason I will list as follows:

First, Technicians make great contribution to US prosperity. Turn back on US history, tremendous graduates with high technical skills who spreading all the industry, academy, and so on. They do not boost US economy, but make the society stable. They are civil engineer who plan, design, and conduct highways, dams, buildings, making improvement of environment and managing natural environment. They are Chemical engineer who explores the process of materials or production and develop new materials. Here are countless examples to be listed all through US society. On the other hands, seldom see US citizen in this field, and I find most of them are in liberty arts and financial services. Also, as Albert Einstein, who is not citizen of US, but US government at that time approved his status to stay in US legally. Currently, some of graduate student do start up, which are not occupy any job position with citizen, but open more job to US job market and relief the burden of US unemployment.

Second, this proposal will attract more international students who have plan to study abroad in US. Because they can stay for long time to gain work experience in US which make them more high competitive when go back to their country. The more they enroll in US university, the more contribution to US university, even US. Their life expense will stimulate consumption in US, including rent, travel, transportation etc. 

Last, the spiritual of US is creation, which make US standing lead in the world. We hope this spirit will last forever. That is US.
