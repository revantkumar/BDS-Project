I strongly support the extension of OPT. The most important reason why I choose US but now UK is that I can work in America for a period of time after graduating from school, but it is very hard to stay in UK after the graduate. For international students, the most important factor of choosing school is whether they can find a job abroad. It is a truth that America is lack of professionals in the field of engineering. Even if the government restricted foreigners to find a job in the field of STEM in America, it wouldn't help reduce unemployment of American, but mignt cause that companies cannot find engineers. It is because that the unemployments of American are not in the field of STEM, but in other fields.
