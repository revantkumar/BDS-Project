Overall I support this extension. The US should be able to constantly attract and retain the best people of the world. 

But the program should restrict eligibility to those students that are actually the "best". That is, they can make significant contributions to the US society and their job, salary and benefits should be given legally and fairly without discriminating against US citizens.
