I am so glad to hear about this new rule regarding OPT extension for F1 student. I am currently working under OPT extension period. I am currently working as ETL developer and providing excellent value for an insurance company in Wisconsin. If I lose my lawful work permit in febuary 2016, I will have to tell my company that I will leave soon. I have couple important projects in my hands, also doing my best to train another employee to take over my staffs if I have to leave soon.

I am undergraduate student gradated at May 2014 from Missouri State University. My current company sponsor my H1B visa, however due to the high volumne of H1B filling rate. I was not lucky to get selected in the H1B random election this year. It gives my family a lot pressure that I have to either leave the country or apply another university after my OPT extension. If the new rule get pass, I will have two more chances to apply H1B and support my family fancially in the place we are living.

Please take consideration of my comment
