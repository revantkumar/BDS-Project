As a foreign student, I do support the OPT STEM extension. For the following reasons:
1, I think this is a part of study. I think study is not only in school. It do about study in companies. 
2, It will bring some new views for the companies. And now many companies do business in global. some students who can speak foreign language and have knowledge related to the business are really helpful.
3, I think this policy can help decrease the application for H1-B. Because many foreign students only want to get some experience in companies and then go back to their own countries. One year is too short. But some extension is good for them. They don't need to apply the H1B.
