Roy Porter The proposed rule would be devastating to American workers, who were denied more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013, as a result of OPT. Furthermore, OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (and thus cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65% of worker salaries when they hire foreign students instead of American workers because they don't have to pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. So far, OPT has removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. For these reasons, the proposed rule should be rejected.
