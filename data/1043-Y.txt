I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1) This proposal will benefit American IT industry a lot, and as a result, it will also benefit America's economy. As we all know, technology has made people's lives much easier and strongly spurred the growth of America's economy. I believe the current situation was contributed by the hard work of both American citizens and non-citizens. Therefore, granting the proposal will facilitate IT companies in finding the right talents, and thus help America maintain its leading position.

2) This proposal fully demonstrates the spirit of American Dream. Encouraging foreign IT talents to come to America will also encourage American citizens to work hard to achieve their dreams!
