I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.it is required 3 years OPT to train a qualified STEM worker.1 years practical training is way too short for training a college graduate to be a qualifie dengineer/scientist Many have the misunderstanding that OPT students are taking away job opportunities that belongs to U.S. residents. That is completely WRONG. OPT/ STEM OPT is for training and serving as a part of university education. The OPT students who want to be working in U.S. in long term has to be converted
to H1B Visa, which the major contributor that takes away jobs from local residents. According to 2015 data. Among the filed 215000 H1B applicants, only 30000 (less than 13%) are STEM OPT students. The results of 2015 H1B approval also shows that only less than 15% of the approvals are given to OPT students, the rest are granted to workers that are imported from other countries directly. If government want to control foreign workers and keep more jobs to local residents. The right thing is to issue a H1B policy change. Revoking STEM OPT will do very little to help.
