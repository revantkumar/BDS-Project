Sir, are you aware of what this proposal is about? It is about OPT students! Not illegal immigrants.

First, OPT students should also pay for federal and state tax. 

Second, OPT students don't have those benefits from the US government.

Third, OPT students can only stay up to 36 months if no further visa is obtained.

If you are talking about illegal immigrants, especially from Mexico, I definitely vote for you. There are way too many ILLEGAL (means no valid visa) immigrants. However this is not what we are talking about today.
