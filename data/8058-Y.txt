Jerry Han I am a U.S. citizen, and do support this extension. A large part of both my school and work population is composed of people of international origin, and it has had a positive impact on my own academic and professional career thus far. It has provided a competitive but healthy environment where all parties can learn extensively from, and I do not think it would progress by stunting international student visas for STEM majors.
