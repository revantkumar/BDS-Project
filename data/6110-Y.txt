Josh Bale I've seen a lot of international students in my college who are very smart and hardworking, they got decent job after graduation, they contribute to their company or even this country as much as we do, if not more. It's unfair to force them leave the country sloly because BAD LUCK on lottery and they definitely deserve more chances. Please note that we can never expect illegal immigrations go back to their own country, those people who didn't win the lottery and leave and true rule followers and well educated, we need them. So please extend the OPT.
