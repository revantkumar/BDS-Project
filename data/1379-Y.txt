More time is needed for the international students to find jobs.The received the best education and have kinds of skills. If they can work in the U.S., they absolutely contribute to the society. However, because of visa status, the chances to get jobs for them are less. Some of them got lucky and they can find jobs within 12 month opt period. But many others don't. It's not that they are unable to find jobs but they just need more time. For the consideration of taking the advantage of people with advanced education and training, I support this proposed rule.
