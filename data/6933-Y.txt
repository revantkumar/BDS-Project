Xinran Zhou I got my PhD degree in materials science early this year. I have never seen any US citizens with a PhD degree in my area has any trouble to find a decent job even though I am sure most of them do not have a good background like me. There are already many doors closed to foreign PhDs and there are still plenty of room for a PhD with citizenship. Thanks to the OPT policies, I can work as a postdoc with little pay for a few more years. I strongly support the idea to make the OPT STEM extension longer because this will give me more time to be well-prepared to get into academia. If this extension got canceled, it is basically impossible for any foreign PhD like me to have enough time to get a tenure-track position.

What I want to say is that, the reason why I stay in the US and keep making contributions to my group and my university is that I feel being respected at here. People believe that my existence can make this country better. I believe this is the reason why the US can be a leader of this world. If this country think I am a burden, I am not interested in staying at here anymore. Can this country afford to loss so many talented people in STEM areas?
