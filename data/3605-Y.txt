Americas success as perhaps the most influential country today is a recent one, precisely due to its attractive policy for the best brains all over the world ever since the two world wars. Turning them away would cause an unimaginable loss to our Economy today and in the future.

It is dangerous for the U.S. to contract its OPT program. As an immigrant country itself, it is ridiculous that such a program stemmed exactly from the American' spirit, which is also essential to keep many 500 fortune companies running, is deemed unamerican in some opposing comments. 

The employees from STEM subjects hardly steal any jobs from the citizens due to the minimal salary limit to hire a foreign STEM employee simply put, you cannot hire a foreign employee with a lower salary than an American one in these fields. Preference is always given to a citizen first. The reality is that the STEM job market is just understaffed. Unemployment rate is high, but not uniformly so in every category of the job market. 

Shutting down the program would only raise the salary for tech employees in a very short period, creating a steep dip in very near future; because these employers would soon go out of business if they do not start massively outsourcing from countries like India and China just like what has been as is still the case with manufactory jobs: they are almost all outsourced to southeastern Asia. It would also greatly discourage foreign students from pursuing degrees in the United States, losing the best brains to competitors with more welcoming environment for foreign workers. 

This country has immigrant problems with stowaways and fraudulent asylum, just like any developed country would have; but your immigrant problem does not lie in these international students from science fields, instead, they are your best asset. Unfortunately this is not widely understood.
