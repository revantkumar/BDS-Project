Glenn Hanson We need to worry about our own get good education not keep giving to foreign non Citizen. Let's try and take care of our own. Slavery still exists when you bring in what you call cheap labor. It might help farmer but look what it has done to taxpayers. All the illegals in the country are costing us billions. Was it cheap I do not think so. Would we not be better off paying more to workers than making it look like we go cheap labor. If we payed more they could probably get people off unemployment and more paying taxes and that would be good for the country, instead of chaos That you have created by so called cheap labor.
