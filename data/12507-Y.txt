I strongly support the extension of STEM OPT and CapGap Relief of all F1 students. By opposing this act, US will lose large amount of diverse and competitive talents from the global, who contributed significantly to those world leading research institutions and companies. Therefore, if this act is opposed, US will be sacrificing the rate of innovation and technological advances, which are the key to improve overall utility and social welfare in the long run. While opponents do have their grounds of arguing the lack of job opportunities for middle class, expulsion of US educated foreign talents will NOT be the sustainable solution to middle class crisis and will only deteriorate the productivity-driven economic growth in the long term.
