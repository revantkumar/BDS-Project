I strongly support the OPT extension.

Firstly, for international students pursuing their degrees in United States, long time OPT is one of the most important reason. International student make decisions to go to US because of the advantage of long time OPT. With the 29 months OPT(the OPT period before the proposal) in STEM fields , international students increased for 28 thousand to 1.2 million since 2008, and 350 thousand international students currently seek their degrees in STEM fields in United States. Now if the OPT could be 12+24 months, more international students could pursue their degrees in STEM fields in US as the trends indicate. As a international student myself, major in computer science, I chose to to run after my master degree in the U.S. instead of UK, Singapore or Canada , just because it provides the 12+17 (before the proposal) months OPT for international students to sharp themselves after their graduation. Now it could be 12+24 months, I feel that I have made a right choice. And I believe, the OPT extension would attract more students to US to pursue their degrees. 

Second, the OPT extension benefits international students, which benefits the US economy. International students have contributed to the US economy. According to NAFSA, international students and their families at universities and colleges across the country supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year. As I stated before, with attractive OPT extension the amount of international students should increase, in turn could contribute to US economy. In addition, for students currently enroll in US universities, the long period OPT would provide them more opportunities to perform themselves and benefits specialized labor markets that align closely with foreign graduates training. 

Therefore, I believe the OPT extension is NECESSARY and BENEFITIAL .
