I agree with the proposal for following reasons. First of all, the expanding opportunities for F-1 students won't necessarily affect the job chances of native Americans, because STEM jobs still give top priorities to US citizens. However, high tech companies which need large number of talents can't simply rely on the limited number of native people. They need F-1 students as well. If we benefit the growing high tech companies, we are benefiting the economy and increasing income for citizens as well. For example, with the growth of Airbnb, local American people have a platform to rent their own rooms. F-1 students aren't making less room for Americans to find jobs; they are improve the whole well-being of the country, thus will benefit every American from a long-term point of view.
