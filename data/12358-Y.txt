OPT STEM isn't anything like other immigration regulations. It benefits both the students and this country. While some of you are saying no to us, you could have invested your time and energy to stop illegal immigrants or whoever brings negative impact and drains this country's resources. Think about it, and please treat us fairly. 

Give us a chance to show what we've learned from this country. We want to give back, and please let us!

Best,

Rachel
