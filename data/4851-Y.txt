I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am an international student from China who studies information science and technology at CMU. Last August, I accepted an offer from a prospective startup (Zugata) whose goal is to build a new performance review system to help workers develop and reach their potential. I am very excited to be part of it. I want to make a difference. I want to change people's lives even a little bit. And I believe I can achieve that goal by working as a software engineer at Zugata.

Before I came to US, I had multiple options to pursue my master degree in US, Canada, Hongkong and Britain. The most important reason I chose to study here is that US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. Thus, OPT extension is very important for international STEM talents. Most importantly, OPT extension can also benefit US academic sector for it to remain competitive globally. If the OPT extension cannot be approved, then I believe US will not attract so many outstanding foreign STEM talents to contribute their knowledge to this country. Besides, it will be a huge disaster to most US high tech companies, like Google, Apple and Facebook if the rule is terminated. Because they are supported by foreign STEM students.

Moreover, the OPT extension can help foreign STEM students finish a complete project without interruption. In this case, foreign STEM students can do their best without worrying about their VISA.
