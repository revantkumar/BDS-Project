I am a STEM student coming from China. I got my PhD in Electrical and Engineering and a master in Statistics. Upon graduation, I got several offers in China and the US. And, I chose to stay here for several more years. The reason is simple. Since I got great education here, I want to reward back to the local economy. I also plan to have my own business here in the US and hire US citizens. The communities in my university treat me well. I want to pay back to them.
