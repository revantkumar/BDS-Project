Maximizing the economic contributions of skilled immigrants is important work, but it is only one component of the broad based reforms our system desperately needs. We must realize that immigrant job creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators come in all shapes and sizes. They come to our shores not only through employment-based channels but through family reunification and as refugees and asylees. They can also be found within the population of unauthorized workers.
