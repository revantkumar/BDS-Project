After having reviewed hundreds of the comments, I find a number of people tend to make a claim that these F-1 international students will not bring us any economically good. This is quite ridiculous. Please allow me to give these people some numbers. According to the Economic Analysis Report for Year 2013-2014 from NAFSA, the international students have brought us totally $26.8 Billion and supported 340,000 jobs! It means every 7 international students enrolled, 3 U.S. jobs will be created. Then I want to ask those with negative comments a simple question: have you ever thought about why U.S. is the No.1 country in the world for international student? One of the most important reasons is that we have OPT program. F-1 students can apply their knowledge to their work during OPT which is very important for the young who just begin their careers. Just think about it. If we do not have OPT extension, what will happen? These talent young STEM students will not choose to study in U.S. and will probably go to Britain, EU, Australia, Japan........ Many jobs related with international students will be gone. Maybe, your friends, your family, or even you will lose your job just because you object to this regulation. We call our nation the land of dreams because we welcome all whatever the race, religion, nationality, and economical condition to join us if they have a dream and believe one day they will succeed by hardworking. Please drop off your bias and prejudice and join me to welcome these F-1 students!
