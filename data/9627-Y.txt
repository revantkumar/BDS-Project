I think the OPT program should be extended not only for those international students but also for the US economy. With the process of globalization, we are having more interaction with the world. Talents and human capital are becoming and would be soon important trading "goods" in the global market. In order to keep competency, America shouldn't close the door for foreign workers but act as a world leader to embrace the change. Competition drives excellence. There are risks at the beginning, such as losing jobs for local people. But the first mover advantage would help improve the US economy and prepare America for the next round of economic revolution.
