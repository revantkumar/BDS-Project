U.S. would get bunch of benefits from the OPT STEM program, which makes me strongly SUPPORT it.

First of all, international students are making huge contributions to our country. Most of them work in scientific and technology, and a great amount of the international students are among the best of their fields. They work hard and pay more tax to both federal and state. That money can be used to the welfare of our people.

Second, OPT STEM program can attract international students. If that program is cancelled, the number of international students would decrease very rapidly. Because the education doesn't have advantage over UK's and Australia's without opt-extension program.

Third, many great creations and ideas emerge in the reaction of different peoples. U.S. has a long history of immigration friendly policy which makes the country strong and thriving. Different peoples from different countries bring fresh thoughts to our countries. 

In conclusion, the OPT STEM program should be SUPPORTTED.
