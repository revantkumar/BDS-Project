I hold master's degree in mechanical engineering. STEM extension is very important. Firstly when a STEM non immigrant student look for job more that Half of the companies are optioned out as they do not sponser visa for F1 students. Every student who comes for masters has education loan and to clear this loan they at least need 2 years.if STEM Extension is cancelled number of international student option ing US for studies will reduce drastically.US is known for its diversity. People from all over the world resides in State and now we are talking about saying no to we'll qualified people. How fair is that?STEM extension will help STATES economy and students both as it is development of both together.so STEM extension should be approved. 
Thank you.
