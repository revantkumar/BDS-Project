I think the 24 months extension would be necessary because for most research in science, especially the one involves experiment, a long time period is needed. For instance, I am doing a research regarding biodegradation of petroleum products, which is related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill. We isolated the culture from water and then grow them in the lab, which usually takes more than 2 months. The actual experiment takes 48-72 days depending on the oil used. The analysis of samples on the instruments takes 3 months. In total it is already 7-8 months, which is only for one set of experiment. In order to know the reproducibility of our experiments and to test different oil and different conditions, more experiments are needed. In conclusion, a long time period is needed for experimental research, and the 24 months opt extension will benefit a lot of scientific research!
