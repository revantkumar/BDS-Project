I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S Those students who can get access to US to get further education has a more solid family background and most of them have a better family education and well behaved..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, Many great people in their period are US international students!

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Furthermore, A lot of international student DO NOT compete with the local US citizens in low wages situation. And competition can help the US find more good labors. And sustain the population pyramid.
