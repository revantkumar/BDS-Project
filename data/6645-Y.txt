I wanted to propose to add Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing and Para Medical sciences to the STEM Program. Dentistry , Medicine, Nursing and Para medical degrees are also sciences. Reports show there's a shortage of medical personnel across US. It would be great if USCIS includes these degrees in STEM. 
Every year there are several International Students who graduate from Accredited Dental schools and cannot work because of Visa problems. 
According to a report released on March 10, 2015 - by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) An overall shortage of more than 15,000 dentists is projected in the U.S. by 2025. http://www.orthodonticproductsonline.com/2015/08/ada-releases-statement-decision-accredit-dental-therapy-education-programs/#sthash.JQ5Irs1F.dpuf 
The ADA says it recognizes that people in underserved communities have difficulties connecting to public health resources and dentists who can provide needed treatment.

According to a report by the Washington Post news the shortage of Registered nurses will be about half a million by 2022 (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/06/05/the-nursing-shortage-and-the-doctor-shortage-are-two-very-different-things/)

Medical Professionals strive to help everyone with improving health and making their lives better. I believe it would be great for USCIS to include Medicine, Nursing Dentistry and different Paramedical sciences to STEM programs.
