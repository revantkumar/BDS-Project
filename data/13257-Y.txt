I support the new regulation for following reasons:
1. It increase the tax revenue of the government and benefit industries directly.
2. It won't harm US jobs because OPT student only can work 2 years and they hold at least bachelor degree from US university. The unemployment rate for US citizen/Permanent residents holding bachelor degree or higher degree is trivial so it is invalid to see that foreign OTP workers take away jobs from US citizens/PR. Instead, new regulation restrict the employers that OPT can work for, which makes it hard if not impossible for OPT workers to replace US workers without higher degree.
3. Many great companies in the world was founded or created by the first generation or second generation of immigrant to US, if there is no OPT there in US anymore, it will potentially undermine the creation of more innovative and creative companies in the US in future.
