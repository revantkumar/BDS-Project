Mark R. Chavez From the view of most high-tech companies, the answers must be "Yes". Why? The high-tech companies need the new staffs with talent and diligence. I believe that the HRs at every high-tech company recognize that the STEM degrees students with F-1 are the people they needed. What are the fortune of our country? It is obviously that we attract the most intelligent people around the world to help us lead the world and make us strong in every subject of science and technology. 

So the people who claim that the STEM students bring their bowls need to realize that the society today is full of competence. If our country becomes more and more conservative and exclusive, the results may be similar to some countries in Europe who slip into recession nowadays.

Definitively, from the perspective of the development of our country, rather than the idea of selfish, we certainly need to attract more intelligent guys from the world and make our country better and better!
