The proposed rule is actually beneficial for American corporations to keep their competitive edges. In recent years, IT and electronics industry have been growing vigorously in India, China, Brazil and Europe. America corporations like Amazon, IBM and Oracle are losing their battles oversea. The only way to stay competitive in such industry is through innovation, which is impossible if those companies are losing the world's best talents to their rivals.

The USA has the best colleges and graduate schools in the world, which attract the world's most talented students. Later on, these students become top class engineers and scientists, a key resource to all the companies that reply on innovation and technology. This new rule gives them an opportunity to serve the cutting edge companies in America and keep them on track. It also creates a great opportunity for American companies to pick the best talents they need.

Does this rule hurt American workers? No. Imagine what will happen without the rule: the top IT and electronics companies in America will soon lose lots of competent potential workers; in order to survive, they will set up lots of oversea offices and tons of business will be transferred to those offices. If that's the case, soon, Bangalore, Beijing or Singapore may take over Silicon Valley and become the next tech hub of the world. American workers will be left behind as the businesses are gone.
