This is an absolutely necessary and great initiative. International students should absolutely have the rights to explore their career opportunities before discovering what they really want to do, either in the United States or somewhere else. This country is founded on immigration, and this country needs brilliant minds. Furthermore, this country needs passionate workers. Anyone who does not like their job will not benefit the workforce either. There has already been a great deal of limitations for foreign workers. Let's not mention the crazy h1b lottery abused by some contracting companies or the endless green card process that prevents one from switching job for as long as a decade. Look ahead and think smart. Keep the best minds of the world in this country!
