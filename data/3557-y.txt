Zhaoyang Qu Everyone came to US State should have the opportunity to practice and training what they have learnt. As we all known 12 months is not a short term, but for most of the projects, this is extremely short. Most of the students could not have an overall view on their own position. Not only good for theirselves' development, but also for the world economy, especially most of the students are coming from developing countries, long term training and well education could help them and also their country, even the whole world to reach to a higher level of people's lives. Which means less hungry, less wars, less pollutions. Please improve and expand the training opportunities for F-1 students, they and the world deserve and need it.
