I am an international student studying environmental engineering at UCLA. I strongly support the rule of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, for the following reasons:

(1) One reason I choose UCLA for PhD study is that US offers flexible training program, a.k.a OPT for STEM student. As an environmental engineering major student, I know the importance of practicing and learning in a real-world environment for perfecting what have been learn on textbook. Without OPT and its extension program, the value of studying in US is negatively impacted. 

(2) I strongly support of the 24-month extension of OPT for STEM student. As the nature of many civil and environmental engineering work, the project cycle spans from 2 years to 5 years based on my experiences. Without the 24-month OPT extension, many US organization will have higher turnover rate of employees and possible higher operational for training and higher HR costs for recruiting efforts with little added value. With the 24-month extension of OPT, US companies will be able to better strategize development plan in a reasonable time frame. Meanwhile, STEM students in the 24-month extension phase are very likely more efficient with adequate training. The 24 months extension is a win-win for both employer and students.

(3) A few of my friends are in the original 17-month extension program working in companies from both high-tech to healthcare industries. Termination of OPT extension, on my own opinion, will have a lasting negative impact on the confidence of US political system and justice system by the many international students. Would the termination happen, such negative impact will be global.
