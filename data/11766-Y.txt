I strongly support this proposed extension of the optional practical training (OPT) program. It provides a great opportunity for F-1 students to advance their learning/training, which in turn allows enough talented and skilled employees for high-tech companies and also scientific research institutes. Without this OPT program, lots of companies and institutes around the country would be affected. This would be bad for the booming US economy. Moreover, a creative, dynamic and diverse society is always the symbol of USA. With the OPT program, the country should continue to attract lots of creative and talented people around the world to boost its economy and scientific and technological development. That is why I strongly support the OPT extension.
