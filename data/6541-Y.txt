Jay Kahn Many talented international STEM students with job offers from US companies have to give up their offers and go back to their home countries because they can not get H1Bs. As a result, they end up with working for non-US companies and use their talent to compete against US companies, and US companies gradually lose both the international markets and domestic market. 

Therefore, denying OPT extension results in a lose-lose situation for both US and the international STEM students, while offering OPT extension creates a win-win situation for both US and STEM students.
