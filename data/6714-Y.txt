Yue Tu From my point of view, international students contributed almost US$27 billion to the US economy in 2014, which corresponds to a 12% increase versus 2013 when the total was US$24 billion, based on the information from University World News. And this trend continuous year by year. As an international student, the reason we choose to study aboard in US is to receive world top education and to apply those knowledge practically during future internship and job opportunities, which will be valuable experience when we head back to our If there is no opt extension, the less chance we us to find a job successfully and we are less motivated to study in US, considering the huge amount of tuition expense as opportunity cost, which will inevitably lead to the loss of potential income from international students for US. The education quality might decline due insufficient financial support from state government and the lack of contribution from those international students, and some competent faculties may be fired due to this coming retrench expenditure. In addition, the fact is that less and less native America choose those STEM majors, so there are not that many qualified native employees for corporations to hire, excluding those proficient international employees. If OPT extension was cancelled, the recruitment would be less efficient in US and those corporations may tend to open factories outside US. More people will lose their jobs and less income tax can be collected by the government as well. So STEM OPT extension is a win-win policy for both international students and US citizens in general.
