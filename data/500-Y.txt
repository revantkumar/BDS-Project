The proposed STEM extension will help lots of international students to gain practical training in USA. The training will provide students sufficient time (on top of 1 year OPT) to contribute to their respective fields of study. It really helps to gain hands on experience in a technologically advanced market like USA. I think OPT STEM extension is very helpful for all International students and also to USA as skilled and scholar students from across the world promote research and development in their respective fields.
