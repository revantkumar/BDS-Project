The 24 Month STEM OPT proposal is a great rule, I am highly support it.
1. Millions of graduated students are practicing their skills for the american companies and they made a huge contribution to the america's economy, technology improvements and generated a large number of IPs for america. If this rule has been denied, they will all lose this opportunity and it would have a direct bad affect for america's economy. And as we can see in the 2009 economy crisis, when the economy is bad, it will affect american to get a job the most.
2. More talented people would come here to make their own contributions. And it will lift the economy which will have more work opportunities for Americans.
3. America is a equal opportunity country. And both america and the foreign students should have the same chance to get their jobs. Companies will only hire the person with the most matched skills and this extension rule will only provide the foreigners the same opportunity as american's to practice.
