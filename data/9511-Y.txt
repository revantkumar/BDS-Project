Joseph Hu Support absolutely. The first couple of years right after graduation are very productive period of time for STEM students. Before moving back to our mother country(ies), we would be highly motivated to bridge our gap between a well trained student and an established leader on the frontier of our field. The extended OPT provides essential flexibility and convince for us to concentrate on the productivity. As a graduating PhD student in physical sciences, I myself gained the expertise on multiple difficult analytical instruments and am excited to, soon after graduation, contribute to significant science projects currently being funded by US agencies. Without sufficient OPT time, I likely waste this period of time on migration status issues, international travel and re-settlement.

Regards.
