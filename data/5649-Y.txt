The OPT STEM program enables international students to apply their learnings in an industrial environment, solve real world problems and hence contribute to the development without having to undergo the hassles of visa processes. The industries on their end get affordable, fresh-out-of school graduates with new ideas and deploy them in their projects. On a bigger scale, international student influx will remain steady to US universities thus boosting economy of the nation and US continuing to be the hotspot for higher education.
I strongly recommend the OPT extension program and even extend it further upto 60 months.
