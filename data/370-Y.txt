Dear Bureau:

As a student with STEM degree who is right now under OPT program, I would like to say the amend of the OPT extension rule is important and necessary.

The education and train in STEM fields usually require a larger time span than other majors. It's necessary to provide a longer OPT for students to accomplish their research and projects in STEM fields without worrying about their states. For example, I am right now work for some green energy projects which requires not only innovative technology but international collaboration. The development of both the technology and relationship are valuable but time consuming which require a lot of intelligence and dedication. Only if the amend of OPT extension rules gets approved, all the international talents who contribute to the project can focus more on the technology side other than worrying about their states. In a word, according to the nature of STEM projects, which usually require longer delivery time, the extension of OPT is necessary and important.

Sincerely!
