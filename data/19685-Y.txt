I have a PhD in electrical engineering and I work in a high-tech company. I have been working with people from all over the world on innovative ideas. All I want to say is, these inspiring and hard working people have been making a lot of contributions in the tech field in the US. A lot of these technologies have great potential in being used in industry and medicare. I can't speak for people from other majors but at least technology wise, we need these people in the US to keep us going forward. These people are truly the driving power of our tech industry and we are built on it. We should keep these people in the US so we can stay No. 1 and keep improving our life quality. I support the proposed OPT extension.
