I strongly support this proposal for following reasons.

1. STEM majors students are all highly skillful students with advanced U.S. degrees. Technology companies are rapidly expanding themselves and need a lot of engineers, OPT extension can give the opportunities for those students to contribute what they studied to the development of United States. It's much better for them to contribute in United States than going back to their own countries to compete with United States companies.

2. Diversity is a really important part of United States. OPT extension will attract more students to study in United States and will allow more diversity of Unites States Education and development of universities.

3. Longer training opportunities will allow students do enough training rather than applying for temporary worker visa.
