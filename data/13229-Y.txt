I strongly support this proposal. Obviously, this gives STEM international students who learn large amount of technologies and knowledges here the opportunities to make more contributions to American society. Someone think this proposal increases the competition for hunting jobs, however, it does good for the society as a whole. Some natives might think it will be harder to find a job, I think it's because you are not competitive at the first place, even though this proposal is not approved, you will always find it is hard to have a job. The significant thing those people need to focus on is working harder, not blaming on the international students.

On the other hand, American is famous for its diversity. How does it come that international students is easy to study here but extremely hard to work here and live here? It doesn't make sense that people are qualified but ineligible to work here, which is far away from American spirit.

In all, advantages of this proposal outweigh the disadvantages some people holds. I truly hope this proposal can get through and bring more benefits to the society in various way.
