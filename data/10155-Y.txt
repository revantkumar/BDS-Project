Anonymous There is a common and blanket conception that F-1 student visa workers (including OPT) do not have to pay FICA taxes, but that is only if they are "exempt from paying F.I.C.A. taxes [in] their first five years in the United States." There are plenty of students who may be considered legal resident aliens, who after completing a Master's and Ph.D degree, for example have resided in the US for more than five years that DO pay payroll taxes (myself included). These students who, if they return to their home countries, never actually reap the benefits of social security, access to medicaid or medicare. Not only that, if they lose their position - there is no such thing as unemployment insurance available to them. I have paid payroll taxes as a visa worker for 6 years but receive none of the benefits green card holders and citizens do. They also face discrimination because contrary to the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers' claims, it's harder to find a position with an OPT degree. The employer is aware that there is a limited duration (1-3 years depending on the type of degree, non STEM only have 1 year) and do not want to hire and train someone only to have them leave a year later. There are numerous state and military sector jobs that only hire citizens, and many private companies that do not want any workers on a visa or who may need visa sponsorship. These hurdles severely limit the type of jobs OPT visa holders can apply to and may be accepted to.
