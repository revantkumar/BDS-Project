Adam Lance I totally agree with this proposal. First giving F-1 students this period of time training opportunity is good for them to use what they have learned from school. Second it will not affect US resident's job cause competition makes perfect. Third the most important reason why people want to come to US is because you give people fair opportunity so that you can have more and more talent people coming work for you which make US stronger.
