Xiaoyu Sherry Di In the last day before due, I would like to say I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons.

1. America is always a multi-culture country. International students become a large part of foreign people in US, which has already contribute thousands of billion dollars per year to the US economy. Extending their time staying in US would help more for US especially for economy.
2.This proposal is for STEM graduates to extend their time working in US. As we all know, the amount of people who work in STEM field is very limited for these days. But STEM students are the majority of international graduates in US. Letting STEM graduates work for longer time is very necessary for the development of technology and economy in US. The lack of native STEM people is the main reason to accept and extend STEM international people staying in US.
3. For positions that require people from STEM field, long time training and researching is necessary. IF graduates only have one year or less working in US, it would be impossible for many companies to develop and grow in many fields. As mentioned previously, native STEM people are limited in US. So how could technology company grow without extending STEM international graduates staying in US?
4.There would be no effect on the immigration if STEM period gets extended. The total amount of foreign employee is limited every year. So extending STEM period is not going to affect the amount of immigrations.
