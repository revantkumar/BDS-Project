I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Most companies hire STEM foreign students based on their skills. Usually hiring foreign students is more expensive. Americans who cannot find a job should not blame the OPT program but themselves because they are simply less skilled. 

Stopping STEM OPT extension will force companies to hire more less-skilled employees. They need more skilled foreign employees to keep the developing. And their developing can actually create more jobs for Americans. Stopping STEM OPT extension will harm the competitiveness of the U.S. and the people of this country.

What's more, stopping STEM OPT extension will make U.S. education less attractive. Many public universities depend on the tuition from the foreign students to expand and grow. If STEM OPT extension does not exist, more potential foreign students might choose higher education from other countries rather than the U.S., which means less money for public schools, probably resulting a decrease in the higher education quality in the U.S.
