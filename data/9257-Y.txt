Take, for example, the case of Elon Musk and many other immigrants who contributed to this great nation. Many individuals contributing to the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in the United States are immigrants, and these skilled immigrants make contributions to cutting edge research innovations and entrepreneurship, which helps grow the United States economy and create jobs for all Americans. Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students will help these students to apply the knowledge they gained from the United States for the benefit of this country.
