Jim Millerschultz I think international students deserve the right to have opportunity working in the US. Without OPT extension, it will be extremely hard for them to stay. My girlfriend is international. She does not need to worry abt it cuz she can marry me. But what abt the other international students? I can see lots of them are very hardworking from my girlfriend and her fellow students. They have potential to create value for the US. It is not good when good candidates want to work for you, and you say, no no no, we don't want you just because you are a foreigner. I hate myself when I type the above sentence. I believe US is not a stupid country like that.
