I do support this extension. I am a foreign student whose major is Industrial Engineering in top 20 graduate school. Before graduation from the master's degree, I found out it was extremely hard to find a related job. I couldn't even get interview after I said I am a foreign student. At the same time, my classmates who are citizens have many more better opportunities than our foreign students do while we have very similar background. When I was looking for a job, I heard so many responses that they want a long-time employee to perform a project which may last for 2-3 years, while foreign students visa may expire before the projects completion, so they can't hire us. But with the STEM OPT Extension, we may have opportunities to finish one engineering projects after graduation. SO I STRONGLY AGREE.
