Han Xu I am a foreign student holding OPT status and planning to found an engineering firm in the US. Hopefully everything goes OK, the company is going to be open next year. If the OPT 24 month extension gets passed, then I will have 24 more months not only to open up my new business but also enlarge my services by recruiting at least one American guy for helping me communicate with local US clients. 

The target market will be customers in the US and China, language proficiency to the target market's location is very important to my business, that is why I value American local employee more than any other countries. 

Saying this for elaborating that how I can create employment opportunity not only for foreigners but also for Americans. If the OPT 24 months extension proposal gets passed, then the firm will be established based on the time granted by the new rule, at least one American local can benefits from this 24 months extension rule, of course, me myself is the beneficiary as well. This is a consequence called "win-win" for both sides: americans and foreigners.

So, as conclusion, I really expect the 24 month extension proposal gets passed, many thnaks for reading my comment
