Xiaomei Tang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. what kind of people the USA need? The person is honest and can help to improve the country. The STEM international students are!!! In the USA, there are not many local STEM employee. So USA needs STEM international students. 

2. There is an old saying which is "one who stays near vermilion gets stained red, and one who stays near ink gets stained black." Which means we need to stay with good and talent people in order to make us stronger. The many international students, who can get a job in the USA, are those kind of people.
