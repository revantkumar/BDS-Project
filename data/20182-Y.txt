Engineering job market becomes stronger currently. Thats the reason that H1B application needs lottery now. OPT extension is also in high demand as a result. I strongly support the expansion of OPT for STEM students. 

Positive competition should be encouraged in industry area, and OPT extension is kind of an exam which would encourage the positive competition. During this period, companies in the US have enough time to evaluate the skills of the international employees. Good ones could stay and non-qualified ones would be kicked out. 

If canceling OPT extension for STEM students, who will be affected? Only those students with high degree and excellent technical skills! For the people who dont have high degree or good skills but just want to stay in US, they can find many ways to stay in the US other than OPT extension. The worse thing is that without the competition from high degree students, those people would be much easier to stay in the US. In the end, the quantity of international students and immigration rate will not change, but the quantity of high degree and knowledgeable STEM employees goes down. As a result, the industrial competitiveness goes down. 

Compare to OPT extension period, the more important thing is actually to do more strict check before OPT extension and H1B approval. Make sure that only the qualified F-1 students could stay legally.
