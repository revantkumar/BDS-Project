I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. International students contribute a lot to the development of US. As we know, lots of international students work at US after they graduate. They use their skill and knowledge to contribute in various area, especially in those high-tech industries. 

2. International students build the bridge between the US and other countries. When big companies like Facebook, Google want to open the market in a foreign country, they need those international students to help them understand that country better so that they could get success in the foreign country.

In summary, the advantages are more than disadvantages of this proposal.
