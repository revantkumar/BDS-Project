I strongly support this rule!!!
Just try to think what would happen if you disapprove this rule. It seems like obvious that the result would be: 
1. Less opportunities for F-1 STEM students and 2. More opportunities for citizens.
And, what does it mean?
1. less STEM students => less competition for citizens => no need for citizens to work as hard to land a job 
2. less STEM students => going back to their own country with all the skills learned in the US => US outflowing talents
3. less STEM students => US universities/colleges have less attraction to international student in the future
And then? Let's take those situations to an (possible) extreme:
1. ...=> People don't work as hard (admit it! it's easy to be lazy without competition. Who doesn't want to relax!) => They're unskilled because of the comfort. => They can't achieve what they should've achieved. => They aren't happy.
2. ...=> US loses its place when it comes to the global STEM market competition.
3. ...=> No more students will go to US to study STEM. => Huge reduction for the economy.
