I strongly agree with this proposal for the following two reasons.

First, this policy is definitely helpful to the economy in US. The talents can maintain the technological advantages of US compared with other countries, such as producing high quality products with less cost. This will make it possible for US companies to expand their business all around the world, which can lead to a better economy. A prosperous economy definitely is good for everyone in the US, especially for the native people. Because they can obtain much more job chances than before due to the prosperous economy and their good communication skills.

Second, as what is said in American Dream, everyone who has the ability should obtain the equal opportunity to pursue their dream. For US with the good reputation of freedom, approving this proposal is one part of encouraging American Dream.
