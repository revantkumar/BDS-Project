I strongly support the new "24-month extension" proposal based on the following reasonings:

Firstly, opt extension is one of the most crucial factor for international students. And international students will definitely bring a great deal of economical benefits to not only local residents but also retailers. For instance, local people would be able to rent house to students and also restaurants, uber drivers will benefit a lot.

Besides, IT industry needs a huge amount of skilled talents. And currently foreign students consist of a big portion. Once opt extension cancel,thousands of companies will lack employees. And it's impossible to train or hire as many as efficient people in a short time.
