I agree with the extension. International students usually work harder and once they can find a job, it represents that the company appreciate their ability and they do own the real capability to do the job. So why not give them more time to contribute their knowledge and wisdom to this country. Current USA has the most strict regulations to accept immigration, comparing with Australia, Canada, New Zealand or some other European countries.So do not send these genius back to their home...
