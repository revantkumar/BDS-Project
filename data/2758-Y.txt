Shaowen Ji I strongly support this proposal because of the following reasons:

1) STEM students, especially with a higher degree, usually showed a strong academic and research background. Thus they can make a huge contribution to US's development in technology. 

2) For STEM fields, it usually takes a longer period to finish one project. For example, in Dow chemical, most projects take more than one or even two years to finish. Very short time OPT will cause the lost for these American companies. 

And on the hand, companies will limit their recruiting of international students (It is happening now!) If it is hard for students to obtain a working experience after study, no more students will come to US for study, which will lead to an economic lost for Education area. 

Overall, I think this proposal will strength US's economy and technology!
