STEM students are making great contributions to the U.S. economy by leveraging their expertise. They bring different perspectives and stimulate the competitiveness of the U.S. job market in a good way - you gotta be among the best to stand out. 

It is definitely more difficult for these international students to get recognized; they need to work harder and network harder, because they are living in a foreign land and speaking non-native language. Their employment by a U.S. employer is the first recognition of their academic achievement (and possibly also their stellar internship experience), and their continued employment is further recognition of their capabilities. One has to make continuous contributions to a company to stay hired, and contributions to the U.S. companies positively impact the U.S. economy. It is totally fair for the STEM students who have demonstrated their capabilities to have 24-month OPT extension.
