I support this extension.

International students paid 30K-60K / year tuition on average and contribute a lot to local economy. The cancellation of OPT extension will make lots of international student think twice before they come to the U.S and will lead much less international student in future. It will hurt universities and domestic students, for the students have to pay a higher tuition. Local economy will be influenced especially for those small town heavily rely on the university.

F-1 student is only allowed to work in their field of study. They will NOT take any low income job and won't affect most of the American citizens at all. As far as I know, they work very hard or at least as hard as everyone else. Their presence helped their companies to get more profit and pushed the progress of technology. The didn't and won't displace American employees. In fact if they were sent back to their own country, chances are more job opportunities will be outsourced to China and India.

It is critical to keep the advantage of technology in our America. Sending F-1 students who educated here back home will weaken the advantage and creates advantage for their own country.
