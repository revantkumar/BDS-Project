I welcome the decision of STEM extension. It will be really beneficial for students and moreover it will attract more international students to U.S. varsities. Most international students pays more than 150k for 2 year STEM graduate programs.Without any doubt it will boost the education sector, more funding for colleges and their research programs. It will not only be beneficial for colleges but for the small businesses whose bread and butter is dependent on college going student will also be benefited. One the whole it will boost the ecosystem. 
In the absence of STEM extension there will be a sharp decrease in international students as most international students join U.S universities for Science related programs and one year OPT is not an economically sustainable option. In such cases students will lured by varsities in Europe or Australia. 
People are more worried about lower wages and foreign students replacing American tech workers. It is a flawed argument as recent college graduates are never a threat to an experienced worker. I believe L1-B and H1-B workers are threat to American tech workers. 
I would even suggest that more F1 students should be absorbed in system via H1-B instead of 20000.
