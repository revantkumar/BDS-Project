I support the Department of Homeland Securitys proposed that would expand the OPT program. This rules would allow international student to work in the tech industry for 3 years. The foreign student can gain the knowledge from the U.S. college in 3 or 4 years. I dont know why they cant have 3 years to give it back to the U.S. society. Most people worried about making U.S Citizen lose their job. But as far as I know, most of the companies prefer to hire the U.S Citizen because of the sponsorship. And also a few companies require only U.S Citizen to apply. Thus, this kind of worried is not necessary. Secondly, everyone wants the society progressive. Without this competitive environment, how the world can be improved. If a foreign student can make more contribution than an U.S citizen, is there any company willing to give up the chance that can make more profits for their own. Thus, under this situation U.S Citizen will perform better than before, for achieving the better position in the company and society. Third, this rule is only applied for some specific majors, which means this kind of area need large number of labors to make value. The international student can fill this void and avoid the demand exceeds the supply'.
