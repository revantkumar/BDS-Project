It is misleading to say STEM students will accept lower wages to earn the employment over local students. One of the term in OPT/STEM mandates employers to pay the same prevailing wages to the international students. Also it is hard to believe that a talented student with adequate skill that would succeed in any other developed countries will accept lower wages in the States purely for the purpose to stay. Even the employer itself tries to create a position with much lower wages that only recruits internal, it will be by no ways able to pass the DHS evaluation and the STEM would not be granted. In addition, having the STEM rule, in general, is delivering a message to the other parts of the world that the states is welcoming young professionals. In a world with most countries that are facing Ageing Societies, this is a great perk that helps the economy. In addition, in my own personal job hunting experiences that most companies would not accept international students on visa, and it is really difficult for students to seize a training/interning opportunity already, even the STEM provision only benefits students employed by those E-Verified employers. Taking the STEM provision away will make the job market so harsh for international students, and why would this not against non-discrimination in the job market?
