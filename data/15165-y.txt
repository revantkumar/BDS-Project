Alexander Toledo I do support this program. First, a large amount of education resources have been put into training these STEM-majored international students. Not using these well-trained workers properly will be a huge waste. Second, most STEM students flow to high tech industries where bulk demands overwhelm supply capacity because of the high entrance bar in these fields. Rejecting international students doesn't mean these jobs can be taken by any other non-qualified people. A more possible result is that these positions will be outsourced to other countries.
