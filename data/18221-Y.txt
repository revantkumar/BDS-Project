I am a PHD student in a university's graduate school. Different with other student, I need not to pay 20,000 tuition every year. Oppositely, our department give me more than 24,000 scholarship every year. Thank you about that America.
If I cannot get the OPT extension, I may have to back to my country after one year. I could not create the value for America society. Our foreigner students with STEM degrees are hardworking people we will bring tax income and more economic improvement for America.
