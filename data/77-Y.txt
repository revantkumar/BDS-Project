America is a country of immigration, hundreds of thousands of elites come to America every year to contribute to this country and fulfill their American dream. That is why America is still developing as a developed country. Without the help of new immigration, we will sooner or later stop developing just like those European PIGS. I believe extend the OPT for STEM is definitely beneficial for most American. It brings healthy competition to our society, America is a successful country till now is because we are open and welcome competition. Take a look at American campuses, we can see many industrious and smart students from China, India, Latin America etc, they are the source of development, wherever they are, they bring development there. If we don't have the courage to welcome them and just send them back to their country, it is a loss to America and will make us be surpassed by those countries.
