I am one of the students who would benefit from this regulation. I have a graduate degree from Stanford, work in a tech
company, and am, in no way, "underpaid", "unskilled", or "uneducated". As you can see, I can speak English very well, and
my coworkers will attest to the fact that I am very good at my job.

I am not alone here. Thousands of qualified students like me who want to contribute to the US economy are being systematically
turned away by the government. These are people who want nothing more than the American dream - the right to freedom and
pursuit of happiness. It baffles me that the government has taken so long to do anything to retain this talent. We're not stealing
American jobs - on the contrary, we're trying to create new jobs by engaging in entrepreneurship. But the government won't let
us. Because of my nationality, the US government won't let me start my own company and create more jobs - I have to wait ten
years to obtain a green card for that privilege. And believe you me - there is no shortage of jobs in the tech industry. Every
qualified applicant has dozens of job offers to choose from, even if they just graduated from college. If you're a qualified worker
in tech - immigrant or not - I can guarantee you that there are jobs for you. If you have trouble finding a job, then maybe you
need to take a hard look at yourself and consider if you're really better than the foreign workers that are replacing you. US
companies have no ulterior motives in "benefiting outsiders" - they hire purely on the basis of merit, as it should be.

This regulation is the right step. It allows young, skilled, educated workers who studied at American universities to work in the 
US. I also agree with the regulation's provisions for ensuring that the hired workers should be paid a wage commensurate with
the industry standard. Allowing more talented people to enter the worker pool will only benefit the economy.
