I will strongly SUPPORT the proposal for Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students because obviously we can keep the top talents in our country. I've been working with asian students for 10 years. They are pretty diligent and clever, and can do a better job. We should definitely keep them making contributions to the US.
