I strongly support this rule. It keeps the attractiveness of US higher education, hundreds of thousand foreign students choose US not only because the quality of education here, but also the chances to gain industry experience and get training. Without this rule, I can see the US education institutes lose huge amount of tuition income since many foreign students choose not come without the necessary training benefit.
