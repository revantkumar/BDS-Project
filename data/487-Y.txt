As a international student who are going to study in the US, I strongly support this rule for following reasons:
1. As a multi-culture country, America always welcomes students from allover the world to study, to conduct research,and even to work in America, just as what is said on the websites of numerous universities in America. It is the advanced technology and teaching and research level attracting so many people to come here. After they finish their study, many of them will in turn continue their career in America, to serve the country, to make more contribution to this country.
2. As a world leader, concerning about its status is an acceptable thing, but, it is not like some say that extending OPT will reduce jobs available for Americans. The fundamental problem is NOT about how long the OPT for international students is, but about the competitiveness of native Americans. When world wide outstanding students converge to America, a competitive situation is formed in which native Americans competing with the best students in the world, that will significantly improve competitiveness of America as a whole nation. So why not to embrace the world and make much more progress?

I sincerely hope this bill will be successfully enacted!!!
