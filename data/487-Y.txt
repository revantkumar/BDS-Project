Fang Chen I highly support to extend the period time for OPT for several reasons:

1. In nowadays, economy becomes more and more global. The product produced will be sold and used in different continents and need to be adapted to different cultures. People with different culture background could have different views and understand the requirement for different market. Besides, more different ideas could generate great idea which will finally improve country's competition capability;

2. With longer OPT time, more international students will choose to apply to US's colleges, which potentially increase the numbers of labors with higher motivation, more innovational, better educated, hard working to pursue their dreams. That is just the spirit of US and in return, it will also prosper country;

3. With more varied cultured international students who are attracted by this policy, it will also highly improve the atmosphere in campus. Students have more chance to make friends from different countries which could help them to learn more about other countries and cultures, understand each other. That is the leader quality needed for future success. Thus, it will help to cultivate more students with opening mind, leader quality. At last, they will make a better country and better world;
