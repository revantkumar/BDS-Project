Harold S. Case As a IT company's HR in CA, I have to say I strongly hope our government to approve the OPT extension.

As a HR, I know how much the cost would be for a company to hire a good employee. Starting from filtering resum, preparing interviews, buy air tickets, arrange hotels, etc. Besides all these costs, we still need to put a lot of money to training our new employees. If there is no OPT extension, the employee could not work for us anymore. All the invest on the employee would be wasted. 

Our high tech companies would face a huge lost on not only the money but also the talents. The progress of projects may be delayed due to the absence of the international employees. Our companies may lose the competition advantages over companies in other countries. 

Some may wonder why must hire these internationals, why not ourselves Americans. As a HR, I definitely prefer to hire our natives since we don't have to pay more money on these internationals' status sponsors. But sometimes, I have to hire some internationals since they own the essential skills of specific positions but our natives don't have. In such cases, I could not let a native on the position to do things they know nothing at all. 

So for the long-term development of our high tech companies, I strongly hope our government to approve the OPT extension.
