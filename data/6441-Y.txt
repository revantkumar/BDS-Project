I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of improving and expending training opportunities. I have following reasons:
1. Improving and expanding training opportunities can help F-1 students to gain more real world work experience and also contribute to the US economy. Most of nonimmigrant students would like to practice their skills in the US after graduation, thus the proposal can inspire more foreign students come to the US to attend college and at the same time help the US to attract more talents in the world. This is a win-win game.
2. F-1 students can fill in vacancies of the US labor force regarding to the STEM. For example, in bay area, a lot of large US high tech companies rely on the talents from foreign countries. And it will be a huge loss if a lot of talents leave. The fast pace high tech industry needs help from F-1 students.
3. The diversity of labor force in the US is an important reason of fast growing economy of US. Thus it is a really wise idea to keep on the tradition.
4. One of the most attractions for foreign students to study in the US is the opportunity to gain more work experience comparing to European countries. 

Thus it is a great proposal and I strongly support it.
