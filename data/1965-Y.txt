This is probably one of the best policies for international students as well as United States. It provides competitive international students a chance expose themselves to companies in the United States.

For those people who think this will let foreigners steal jobs from US citizens, you are wrong! US government has always been very respectful to talents (domestic and international). There are many laws and policies supporting international talents. OPT is just one of the those. In fact, these policies together make US the strongest country in the world.

Here is how it works:
Better policy for international talents -> more competitive companies -> more jobs, economic profit and tax -> even better policy for talents -> ...

Sure some might still argue that jobs are stolen nontheless. But that is inevitable because US is an open country facing competition from the world. If we instead make the policy less friendly, this is what would happen:
Worse policy for international talents -> more domestic people get jobs (obviously less competitive than those international employees you can get with same salary) -> less competitive companies against threat from other countries (German, Korea, China, etc.) -> less jobs, economic profit and tax -> have to cut off more perks because lack of money -> less jobs and talents are leaving -> life quality drops because things are getting more expensive -> ... (all the bad consequences you can see from those conservative third world countries)
