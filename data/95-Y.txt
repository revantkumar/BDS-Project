I strongly support this proposal. The reason why i chose to come to the US for my college degree, is that US has the best educational resources and its policy regarding foreign hires. Employers strive to hire the best. I am attracted by the idea to work for the good company and work with the best people. If US cancels OPT program, I believe American colleges will not be so attractive to foreign students any more while many other countries are actively seeking talented international students. US will lose tons of talents because of that.
