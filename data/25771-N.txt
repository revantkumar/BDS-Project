The effect of this program not only limits the number of jobs available to our own students, but at the same time further hurts
the Social Security system by allowing these foreign students to work in the United States and not pay their fair share of the 
taxes. Our Social Security system is all ready in danger of fracturing from over withdrawal of funds to people who have never paid a penny into the system. Further more our own graduating students have to compete with those who will take less pay for the same jobs. It is such a cowardly way for Obama to undertake this measure, and at the same time insist that
women should be paid the same amount as men when doing the same type of work. To me it is just further prof that Obama
will do anything he can to bring down our country. When will the people wake up and see what has already been done by Obama and his Democratic Party, but it is sad to think that those who are on the wagon demanding more free benefits are permitted to vote in our elections. This country is always ready to not only help the foreign nations when they need our assistance, but also send our young men and women to fight their battles and give up their lives for their benefit. Our country is in decline and our culture is also on it's way down, those of you who have children will some day realize how much damage was done to this great nation while we just stood by and did nothing.
