I really really wish our federal government would stop making life hard for the working americans. Things just keep getting worse and worse for working americans and no one in the federal government seems to care. Don't you think you are taking good paying jobs away from americans when you help foreign students with the OPT program? Also I don't appreciate the social security and medicare funds being used in this way. I don't pay into these systems to have the money used for foreign
aid. Stop giving america away and start serving the people you work for.
