I am writing in opposition to this whole thing. Once again trying to circumvent the congress and get away with giving jobs to 
people who have no business getting jobs in this country! These students should have to leave just like they agreed too! This OPT rule is a bunch of stuff also!
Send these students back to the countries that they came from and stop giving our jobs to non immigrant students!
