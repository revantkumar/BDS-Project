Ying Zhang I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons: 

1. I believe one of the most important reason for U.S.A as the most powerful and developed country all over the world is because of the talent people here. Extending OPT can attract more and more talent people study, work and make contribution to U.S.A. 

2. I understand some U.S.A citizen think that the international students take their jobs. But I believe that competition is not a bad thing. Competition makes people work hard. It's a good thing for U.S.A to develop it's economy in a long run. In my view, fighting and working hard is U.S.A spirit.
