Lu Huang I STRONGLY SUPPORT this new 24-month OPT STEM Extension. This new rule will allow talented foreign students with higher degrees to continue to practice their expertise gained through education from accredited US universities. The contribution of these foreign students will promote the development of US research and industry. In addition, foreign students working under OPT also pay taxes and help the growth of local and national economies. The implementation of this new STEM Extension policy would benefit the people and the economy of the United States. I highly support this new policy to be APPROVED!
