It is clear that the Optional Practical Training (OPT) bill will give STEM jobs
to foreign students, when American citizens are available for and want these
jobs. Also companies are able to replace their current employees with 
foreign graduates, all to lower costs. This has already happened with Southern
California Edison and with Disney.

This is a horrible idea. It damages American tech workers; they lose their jobs,
and have even been forced to train their replacements. What a disaster for
American citizens. Stop OPT. It is unnecessary, and it is cruel to American
citizen students and tech workers. We need Americans working for Americans.
