I would like to express that I wholeheartedly support the proposed rule! 

As someone who has earned a STEM degree in Mechanical Engineering and is currently employed by a major company in the field of engineering design, I am very grateful that I have the opportunity to obtain my OPT so that I can continue my course of study and gain real life work experience through my employer. 

I can honestly say that there is definitively a shortage of highly-qualified workers in our field and every major companies in our field is aggressively seeking talents in order to be competitive. And I think the OPT program and the proposed improvement to the STEM extension can further benefit not only the students, but also the US employers. And more importantly, the US as a country can gain more competitive edge by attracting and being able to retain more and more talents in the advanced field of science and technology.
