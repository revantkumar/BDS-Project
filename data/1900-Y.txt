I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following two reasons: on one hand, the goverment should let the students who learned knowledge from US universities stay in the coutry and let them keep making contributions to the US; on the other hand, diversity is very important for the US. In fact, a lot of very famous guys who made great contributions to the US are from other counties at the first place. In all, we all would love to have the chance to make a contribution to the US and to prove ourselves. Thanks.
