I support the proposal for the following reasons: 
1. Opportunity should be equal to everybody. If you have the talent and capability, you will get a job. It doesn't matter who compete with you. 
2. International students want to work in US to gain some experience because US is attractive to them. That's actually a good sign of showing the power of US to the world. Their home countries invested billions of dollars on their students. And all of sudden, they come to study in US and work for US, most of whom paid tuition and fee on their own.
3. In the job market, US citizens already have much more opportunities than international students. If US close the door totally, I don't think it is good. In history, a country with a seclusion policy loses their power eventually. US will step furter to this direction if they don't provide OPT to international students.
