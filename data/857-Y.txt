I support this rule with the following reasons:
1. The international workers will empower the economy of USA. 
2. Some of the international students, especially most of the Ph.D. students are funded by the government or companies in USA, it is not fair for the companies if they cannot keep the students they funded.
3. The longer OPT will also attract more international students to study in the USA.
4. The longer OPT gives the international students more time to learn the American culture. It is good.
