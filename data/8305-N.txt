The proposed OPT extension is a corruption of the H-1B visa category. It puts the foreign student into the U.S. workforce in completion with U.S.-born STEM workers and makes them more attractive to employers by treating them as trainees rather than workers. 
OPT has been created and is being lengthened simply to provide a larger number of foreign STEM workers into the hands of employers in an evasion of the H-!B visa process.
The proposed extension simply increases the number of foreign workers without regard to the visa regulations that are designed to limit the number of foreign workers entering the U.S. job market to compete with U.S.-born workers.
The subterfuge of the OPT program should not be compounded by lengthening the period that employers are able to take advantage of undercutting the wages of U.S. workers.
