Totally agree with this idea of extension!

US welcomes all the smart foreign students, especially those STEM students, to help make constributions to US. The government should give these students some time to work in US after graduation. Three years is a perfect time period.

US need these young people, especially in the field of technology. I cannot imagine what the situation will be if there are no STEM students working at the bottom of the IT companies to do so many things.

I hope this proposal will be approved.
