There is a dearth of talent in the STEM fields. As a trained engineer from two top engineering schools, I know the difficulties of getting educated, innovative scientists on the front lines. It is important to ensure a steady work stream of individuals to ensure that America is at the forefront of R&D. 

I know there is a fear the immigrants are taking jobs away from Americans, but in this case, there is an over supply of STEM jobs and not enough credible people to fill them. I fear the if we do not do this, the US will have to face a future which puts it behind its competitors. This also serves strategically to prevent top talent from returning back to foreign countries.

PhD and Master's students from other countries come to the US to get the opporutnity to work with the brightest and most well-funded labs. Many want to stay but the innability to get work permits makes it difficult for them to see those dreams fulfilled. I hope that the extension of the STEM OTP will solve this crisis. Thank you.
