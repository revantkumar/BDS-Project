I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. Since this proposal is a win-win strategy for both the US and international students. I am a potential student in STEM major from China, it the US government cancel this extension, I am not going to apply the American university, and will not work in America. Some American may think they can get my job if I do not work in US, BUT, I will say, I am major in Statistics, most of local American are interested in Statistics and Maths, and most of statistics students are Chinese in American universities, these Chinese students will work in high-tech companies, which contribute most of taxes and GDP for America. If these international students will not get the STEM OPT extension, these students will not work in US,but there are few local Americans learning maths and statistics, therefore, these high-tech companies will not employ the excellent students and lost their competitive power in market. Therefore, America will lost her advantages of high-tech in the world.
