I strongly support the extension of OPT for F1 students with STEM degrees for the following reasons. 
1. it is a waste of resources of American government in multiple ways to terminate the extension. For an average phd student, at least 60,000 is spent for tuition, stipend and insurance. For one position, especially those that require specific skills, recruiting is expensive. At least $ 20,000 is spent during the process. If the person loses the position for visa status reasons, the company certainly needs to go through this again. Not to mention the loss during the recruiting and transition period. 

2. it is not fair not only for international students but also for American. It is never fair for internationals from day 1. We go through a different screening processes than domestic students. Almost all fellowships are only available for U.S. citizens or green card holders. Most of companies would prefer to hire Americans simply because they don't have to deal with all the working permission processes. Therefore, it is already harder to begin with. I've been to career fairs where the recruiter saw my Asian face and directly sent me away because they do not hair internationals. Termination of the extension will certainly make the situation worse. For a country that believes in freedom, equal opportunities, and hardworking, this is simply sad. 

3. it is needed for both ends. STEM students have specific skills that are needed and also require a long time to be trained. It is be a huge loss and even might drag U.S. technologies behind if they do not have the specific techniques. From the internationals' point of view, we need enough time to go through the transition.

4. Last but not least. We should offer equal opportunities and let the employers decide who them want, rather than creating more difficulties for anyone.
