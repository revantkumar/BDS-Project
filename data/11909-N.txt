1) I am a degreed engineer, with over 25 years of private sector experience in Silicon Valley. I have worked as an engineer, a manager of engineers, and as an owner of my own engineering consulting firm. Unlike the lawyers and lobbyists that populate the DC area, I can speak from direct experience about the STEM profession.

2) There is NO shortage of STEM workers. This is proven by the stagnant wages and declining benefits across a large swath of the STEM field over the last decade. It is also proven by the blatant age discrimination that is being practiced by hiring companies. 

3) The push for extending H-1B and OPT has nothing to do with shortages, it is purely about continued suppression of STEM wages.

4) The government's willingness to listen to only the deep-pockets campaign donors with a vested interest in lowering STEM wages is alienating an entire generation of young adults that can readily see there is no long-term career prospects in a field that is essentially under attack by the very government that is supposed to represent them. This is doubly true for under-represented women and minorities that are already reluctant to enter this field.

5) This country is hurting, economically and socially. We need to start ensuring that jobs go to citizens of this nation. The OPT program is of dubious legal standing and should be ended immediately. The H-1B program should be scaled-back and overhauled when the opportunity arises to prevent further abuses.
