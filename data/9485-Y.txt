As a STEM student, I strongly oppose to shortening OPT. It would be a nightmare for us. First of all, it is already difficult for STEM student to find a job within a short period of graduation. Second, we still need to wait for a long time to be issued H1B even if we did find a job. We will not be able to stay if we do not have the elongated OPT. STEM students from other country are a nonneglectable source for America's development. If there is no expended OPT, fever scientific elite will be able to contribute to this country.
