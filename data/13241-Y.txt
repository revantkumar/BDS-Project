The proposed rule is really a good rule which will not only provide opportunities for international student.

Number of International students in US Universities are increasing year by year due to the high standards of education which includes research, highly trained and experienced professors and many more. There are more than 400,000 international Students currently pursing their education in US. The total revenue which US gets from one international student is way more than an American Student. It's not only in the education internationals pay more taxes which adds a lot of revenue to the US Economy.

US Universities will be badly effected if the STEM extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months. Big Data which was developed in 2008 at Yahoo labs had many top notch brains. Even today Facebook pays lot to hire top students from MIT, CSU and other universities to introduce new mechanisms of securities. Not only in the IT, Intel and Qualcomm hires lot of STEM Student for Research and development on building some good performance chips that are used in electronic gadgets. Apart from this lot of research is done by international students in the area of biologic's. 

By this Rule it will be really really helpful for the STEM student to learn for few more months and contribute to the US economy.
