First of all, I feel people should be rational towards this OPT STEM extension policy and should not use this as an excuse to attack the current government. The OPT STEM extension was introduced in 2008 by the George W. Bush administration to attract international students to study, contribute and spend money in the US, so there is really no point attacking the Obama government or Hilary. The college tuition fee plus living cost for a foreign student can be as high as $70,000/year. This enormous amount of money will not go to China or Mexico, but flow into the US economy, and thus creating thousands of jobs in the US. 

The average wage in the US hasn't been increased for years now, thus I do understand those claiming that the Obama government is trying to use foreign students to lower down the wage. However, I think the real reason is that the US has encountered the middle income trap, which means that given America's current resources and advantages, people's wages cannot go higher. The only way to drive all US workers' wages up is to have a productive and innovative economy. In the current globalized world, having only the local talents are not enough, we really need those top foreign students to bring energy and innovation to our society. Do you really think that you will have a better paying job if we chase all the foreign students out of the US? If we do that, very soon, America will be become a lazy and stagnant country, and everyone will be worse off.

PS:Neither OPT or OPT STEM extension is an immigration visa. The H1B quota is only 65,000, most of the foreign students will have to leave the country once their OPT extension ends.
