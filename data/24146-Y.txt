I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.

One key factor to any countries' success is technology advantage. Besides educating and nurturing more of its own citizens, another effective way is to attract foreign talents. US has been able to attract such talents from all over the world because of its current technology lead/advantage over other countries, and those foreign talents contribute further to this lead/advantage. These students are not competing with US citizens, they are just filling shortage.

If US cancel such OPT and extension, it will have an great impact on the current US tech industry. In the long run, it is detrimental to US's sustainable success.

Therefore, I would support this proposal.
