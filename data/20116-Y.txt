I fully SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who studied in U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. A lot of STEM students work in the hi-tech industry after graduation, which helps U.S. maintain the leading position across the world.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. It promotes hard work and creativity. Everyone has to push himself/herself to grow. The society needs diversity in order to change, grow and innovate.

3. Competition does exist, but it is a good thing. Competition leads to innovation and also forces everyone to be more creative. The whole country grows as a result. Besides, companies offer jobs to STEM students since they cannot find enough qualified American students. STEM students do not snatch American's jobs.
