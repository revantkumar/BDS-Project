I find it hard to believe what I read about the OPT program. Why would any country give benefits to a student from a foreign country over their own citizens who are born here? Only to diminish and eventually destroy our own country. Is any other country crazy enough to allow the same set of circumstances. I have lived a long time, and am disconcerted that such a situation is allowed to exist. 
We, the American taxpayer, is taxed to death. Instead of thinking of ways to make it easier to live in this country which we love, no consideration is given to the people who are born here. 
Parents who sacrifice to send their children to college expect that upon graduation that particular student will have the advantage of achieving success through a good job. The expensive tuition in colleges and universities are a burden that we must assume to give our children the best education that money can buy.
To realize that foreign students get a privilege that we do not is most exasperating. I feel the world is topsy turvy!
