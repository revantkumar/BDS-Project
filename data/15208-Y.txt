I think improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students is necessary. This program not only can provide some working experiences for international students, but also can bring many benefits to local companies. Firstly, When companies are expanding their business to the world, these international students can provide more opportunities. They are familiar with both cultures and know how to communicate with local people. Secondly, most international students have the professional knowledge and experiences, if American companies can't keep them here, they'll lost competitiveness with other countries. Last but not least, American is an immigrant country, so we should open our door to those talent students.
