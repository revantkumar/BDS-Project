Mounika Gadde I support OPT extension not just because "Talent and capability of an individual never gets suppressed by genuine competition".

I strongly believe that United states of America is a land of Immigrants and it never lets down the hopes of young aspirants who have zeal and potential in driving this entire world efficiently. No matter what the nationality of students is, they always deserve a chance to prove themselves and make lives of their dependents safe and secure.
