As a master student major in Software Engineering in one of the top technical schools in the US, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal!

I believe the OPT extension is both critical and essential for the US labor market. International students with higher education in US contribute great efforts to the economy as well as woking opportunities by applying what they learned to practice. Mike Krieger, co-founder of today's most hot social media app Instagram is once an international student in STEM. This original photo-based app not only changed our life style by sharing photos, but created thousands of working opportunities, contributed tens of millions of dollars as tax and help more and more people get better connected. 

Not only in IT, STEM students contributed their efforts in Mechanics, petroleum, bio-medical, etc. US, not like China and other developing counties which depends on its massive and ill-payed labor workers, continues to lead as the worlds most innovative economy pointed out by President Obama. This requires us to attract best talents regardless of their color, nationality, ethic, etc. Those international students went through STEM programs are definitely such great human resources we should preserve. It is responsibility of USCIS to approve better program for STEM students not only by approving this 2 years extension, but also better H-1B program to attract as many highly innovative workers as possible.

To sum up, I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.
