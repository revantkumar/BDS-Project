I have been using OPT to work as structure engineer for a while. My supervisor said "we are happy to have you, especially at this time." What he said means the economic now is very hot and market is so fast. Everyone relating to houses is very busy and in high pace. The builder is trying to get more land everyday; the architect is finishing drawings every moment; the construction worker is too busy to make an appointment. As for us, structure engineer, my efficient work makes the loop work. I have finished designing more than ninety houses since this year which contributes to the local economics. All these contributions due to OPT opportunity, more specifically, duo to OPT extension. I have my OPT extended from this June. 

I believe there are more than thousands and thousands OPT students that are contributing to American economics in their own occupation now. And lots of them may also become indispensable backbone in their company and may have been making great contributions. These are all because of the OPT, which is a confirmation of American spirit - everyone has fair opportunity to make contributions with their hard work and great talent.
