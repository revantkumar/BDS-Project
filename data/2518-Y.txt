Terry Knutson I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE PROPOSED RULE: IMPROVING AND EXPANDING TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR F-1 NON
IMMIGRANT STUDENTS WITH STEM DEGREES AND CAP/GAP RELIEF FOR ALL ELIGIBLE F-1 STUDENTS IS IN BEST 
INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORKING AMERICANS AS WELL AS THE AMERICAN STUDENTS 
COMING OUT OF SCHOOL AND BEGIN WORKING IN THE FEILDS OF STUDY. ALSO THE PROGRAM WAS SET UP TO 
EDUCATE AND RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND BEGIN WORKING IN THE FEILDS OF STUDY. WE ELECT 
PEOPLE TO REPRESENT US IN CONGRESS WITH ARE CONCERNS . IT FEELS LIKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE 
DISRESPECT TO ME,TO MY REPRESENTIVES AND TO OUR CONSTITUTION. WE THE PEOPLE IS HOW THIS 
SUPPOSE TO WORK I WAS BORN IN AMERICA,EDUCATED IN AMERICA,WORKED IN AMERICA,SERVED IN THE 
UNITED STATES NAVY FOR AMERICA RAISED A FAMILY IN AMERICA I HAVE PROMISED TO BE HEARD BY THE 
GREAT MEN THAT WROTE AND SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION.
