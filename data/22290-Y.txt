I STRONGLY SUPPORT the new STEM OPT extension proposal for the following reasons:
1. U.S. is a nation built on immigrants. It goes without saying that numerous outstanding talents come from STEM areas, who have contributed greatly to the prosperity and growth of the nation. I cant imagine one day many of those talents have to leave due to VISA status. Thats definitely a DISASTER to our country.
2. STEM OPT extension is an excellent strategy to attract more international students to American academic sectors. As we all know, many countries are actively instituting new rules to attract more talented international students to their countries. Why would they choose us? The STEM OPT extension is for sure among the top reasons. If the extension is no longer valid, students would think twice about coming here.
3. Some negative commenters stated that F-1 students on STEM OPT extensions would work for lower wages and as a result, citizens cant find jobs, which is totally RIDICULOUS. Just take a look at tech industry, especially California and Silicon Valley, its not uncommon that new grads make $100K a year. And the bar for international students is the same as citizens, sometimes even higher.
In summary, U.S. has benefited and will continue to benefit a lot from the extension. I STRONGLY SUPPORT the new STEM OPT extension proposal.
