I strongly SUPPORT this proposal because of following reasons:

1: The international students are making huge contributions to the U.S. economy these years, especially in the high-tech sector. They are helping an increasingly amount of tech giants keep competitive around the globe, which in turn benefits the U.S. economy and create more jobs for all.

2: Diversity is the key to keep U.S. competitive and excel in the 21st century. If international students are deprived of legal working rights in the U.S. after graduation, then less and less international students are willing to pursue degress in the U.S. It will not only hurt the U.S. higher education system, but also harm the competence of U.S. economy because of the loss of foreign talents.

Let's make the foreign talents work for the U.S.!
