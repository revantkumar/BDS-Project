One thing you did not understand is, these F-1 students are not immigration status. Even when they pay taxes, they are called "aliens" and have to pay more than American citizens while can't enjoy some of the deductions and exemptions that you can enjoy as a citizen. I think it is the illegal immigrants that you need to worry about. They are not paying taxes, and citizens like you and "non-residential aliens" like these F-1 students have to pay everything for them.
