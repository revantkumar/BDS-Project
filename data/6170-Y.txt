Mengmeng Xu I strongly support the proposed rule for the following reasons:

1. In general, F-1 students with STEM degrees are smart and hard working, and their professional skills and expertise could make great contributions to the related industrial fields. Improving and expanding training opportunities for them is a good way to attract and retain these talented nonimmigrant people, which will then benefit the U.S. economy.

2. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance to work. And talented F-1 students who come to US to study deserves more time/opportunities to practice their skills after graduation. Besides, as you may know, there are still chances of not getting selected in H1B lottery even after you find a job. And OPT extension and Cap-Gap relief are necessarily required to prevent those companies from losing valuable employees. 

3. Since the rule only focuses on nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees in the related and highly specified fields, its effects on the total job opportunities for domestic workers are limited. Furthermore, equal employment opportunities and competitions could help to build healthy and dynamic working environment and therefore boost U.S. economic growth.

4. This rule is also good for U.S. education since improved training opportunities for F-1 students would attract more international students coming to study in U.S.
