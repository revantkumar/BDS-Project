This is really a good proposal. Although some people challenge this by saying that foreigners take away native people's jobs, this is ridiculous. Because they just want to avoid competition and get their jobs easily. If there is less competition, many employees will not work hard to earn their life and the work efficiency will decrease, which would leave a negative effect on US economy. Since international students are so intelligent and highly-effective, they should be given the opportunity to make their contribution to US industry. So this policy will encourage all people including native people to work hard.
