Strongly support this proposal since the following reasons:
1. International students will be allowed staying this country and what they learned can make a big contribution, especially STEM students. 
2. Some outstanding team of start-up and company comes from international students. They contribute a lot of working opportunities for people. Extension of international students can also make space for domestic students. Its a WIN-WIN.
3. Open and social inclusion are the factor of USA's success. Absorbing more talented F-1 students and let they stay long time is beneficial for USA's future.
