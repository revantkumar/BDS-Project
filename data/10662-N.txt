I continue to be appalled at the lack of interest shown by our government in the plight of unemployed American workers. Optional Training Program OPT stole 430,000 jobs from American workers from 2009-2013 and $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds.
How dare you seek to change regulations that will further impact American workers!!!
Do you have no shame?! How many of these OPT workers ever return home? My guess is none.
There are plenty of American citizen computer degree workers and STEM workers. Do not continue to use the H 1-B visa program to bring foreign workers here instead of using American workers.
This is shameful, actually immoral.
