College grads, most of them already behind with large student loans can not get jobs. I keep hearing about certain jobs needing to be filled, but it sounds like the same old story. First it's we need low skill workers because Americans don't want those jobs. Now we need high skill workers because Americans can not perform at those jobs. So is this administration trying to tell me that the American worker either doesn't want to work hard or the college grads here are too stupid to fill these positions? Well it probably comes down to Americans wanted to make a descent wage for hard work or a very descent wage for a return on all of the money they spent on a higher education which seems to be useless if we keep bringing in foreign workers willing to work for less. I am sick and tired of the American people getting screwed.
