I Oppose- Very unfair to residents and citizens to extend the stay of F1 students. US should keep higher education for foreigners and local job opportunities separate. All local job opportunities should be offered first to residents as companies are laying off locals and hiring F1s on low wage. F1s should be mandated to be hired on higher wages than prevailing wages so companies genuinely try to hire residents and citizens first rather than hiring F1s on priority. F1s are hired on low wages and then treated miserably with lower increments, long work hours etc. and they do it as this is the only way they can stay in US. All that American dream stuff comes years later when they are already through their youth. Stop this extension ASAP as this encourages back door entry and companies are exploiting this practice. Students even after getting hired want to remain on OPT as this way they avoid social security taxes and only when their OPT is about to end is when they transfer H1B. Govt is losing so much on taxes because of the current extension itself and this exerts undue pressure on people who are paying these taxes. Has anybody in govt done this cost benefit analysis? Studying in US should just be considered as a upper edge than studying anywhere in the world and providing a US job after US study should not be guaranteed. Abolish this OPT and OPT extension asap to save jobs for Americans and residents.
