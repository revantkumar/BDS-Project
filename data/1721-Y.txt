Foreign students (PhD students) are the major working forces in today's university research activities. Like the research group (on computational electronics) where I am currently working, four out of five research projects are solely finished by the foreign students and the remaining projects, which usually requires security clearance (meaning only US citizens can work on that project), frequently needs inputs from the work done by the foreign students (for example the atomic structure of the material and some material properties). If there is no such extension, the US universities will become much less attractive because students, especially the ones that pursuing the advanced degrees, will obtain much less experience from the course of study. Indeed, almost all of my friends choosing to come to US instead of going to UK or other European countries to pursue their advanced degree are due to the fact that the US can provide much better training opportunities than other countries. The results are obvious, if there were no such OPT extension program, there will be a huge lack of capable PhD students in the US universities and the basic research activities in the universities will be greatly and negatively impacted.

As to the lack of US citizens in the population of PhD students, it is not because the US universities do not want to enroll US persons as PhD students; it is just due to the fact that there is not enough number of US persons to apply to the PhD program. Every year my professor wants to hire several US persons as PhD students in our research group but often, it turns out that there are no US citizens in his class. Since all the PhD students are paid equally according to the universities' policy, there is no salary competition from the foreign students. In fact, professors are more likely to hire US citizens as PhD students because they can also work on the restricted projects.

In summary, if there were no OPT extension, the number of foreign students wou
