I strongly urge the government to pass the OPT extension policy. America needs foreign international student and many of them are brilliant. The decline of OPT extension policy means those student educated by US universities can only turn back to their home country and this will increase the competition, and jeopardize the benefit of US. Please pass the policy now!
