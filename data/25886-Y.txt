America is a land to chase your dream. This what I learnt in textbook. I tried to work harder than anyone to realize my dream as a scientist. If someone just tell me no matter how hard I struggle this country won't offer me a fair opportunity to work, then is it worth my contribution? I'll reward twice of everything you give me, only if you give me a fair chance to do it. Hope this opt extension be approvaled to make more intelligent foreigners working for the country.
