I've been in the IT field for over 25 years and every year it keeps getting worse.
The demands just keep on growing and the salaries stay pretty much the same or in some cases go down.

25 years ago corporations went out of the way to recruit, train and nourish new college recruits.
Today unless you're the cream of the crop they don't bother. 

There is no incentive for corporations to recruit from within the US. Cheap H-1b labor is the way to go.
College recruits graduate with huge debts (so they demand more) while their overseas counterparts are debt free and can go anywhere in the US.
When one company hires H-1b it the others need to do it to remain competitive even if they know in their hearts that its wrong.

There are thousands and thousands of IT works unemployed today. We need to do more to help them find employment and training. 
This bill gives corporations little to no incentive to hire them and will greatly decrease the employment opportunities for Americans .

Sometimes the only way you'll know how much something hurts is to experience the pain for yourself. 
Government employees are immune from external H-1B pressures so they have never experienced the pain of loosing a job.
If the government feels so good about this bill is good they should practice what they preach and start recruiting H-1B themselves.
