I strongly SUPPORT the proposal, the reasons are:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Many scientists and technicians who made great contribution to the nation are previously international students in U.S. previously.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.
