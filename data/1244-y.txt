Rebecca Nimmons This country is great in large part because of all the wonderful people who have immigrated here from other places.
If we don't welcome them to our shores, we are fools. And we will miss out on all their goodwill and talent and work.
We need these people for our country to stay great and be greater. Immigrants who want to be here are a treasure 
and an asset beyond anything we could ask for. We must welcome them because we too came from immigrants and
were welcomed to this great nation. It's payback.
