Yunzhong He I strongly support the OPT extension as it is crucial for attracting global talents in STEM. Under the current H1b lottery system around half of the STEM graduate who get hired in industry will have to leave the country, which is unfortunate both for them and their employers. And the OPT extension gave them better chance of transferring to H1b visa.

I have witnessed talented engineers working in tech giants being relocated to Canada simply because of not being able to obtain a work visa in the lottery system, and they are paid far above the minimal wages. Moreover, some employers become reluctant to hire international students for having the risk to lose them after their one-year OPT period, which leads to discrimination in their hiring process. 

Having a two year OPT extension offers a smooth transfer between student visa and work visa, and shall prevent the nation from loosing STEM talents.
