I think the OPT should be extended to give the F-1 students more time and opportunities to create value for the United States because that can make help the companies hire more creative employees and force the native Americans be more competitive. 

First of all, expanded OPT can attract more talent students come to the United States and help the companies create more value. The F-1 students who need the OPT to apply jobs are seeking for jobs in more challenging jobs and desire to create the value for United states. They are not those who will be liabilities for United States. The United States as a diversity country should not refuse anyone who want to contribute. Also, the longer OPT will attract more talent students come to USA and improve the competition of the country in all aspects.

Secondly, the good competition will create more value. Since the longer OPT offers the foreigners the equal opportunities to compete with the native Americans, Americans will feel more stress when seeking for jobs, which will force them to preform better and improve themselves in colleges. The competition will force Americans to be more creative and make value for companies. Also, that competition will bring America increditable treasure and improve the national power in many aspects.
