I support to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students with STEM degrees and Cap Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 Students. Immigrants make this country energetic, especially those with decent training in technology and high level of education. I entered US as F-1 student and currently work in the health care field after earned a master and doctor degree respectively. I feel like that I can and am giving back this great country what I learned from the school and training in public health and medicine in US. All the F-1 students should be given the opportunities for the same reason.
