This rule should be strongly SUPPORTED!! Look at the big company running United States today. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft etc. EVERYONE of them is hiring lots of foreign graduated students who have skills and talents. Why do they do that? NOT because those big companies can pay less to them, but because they are GOOD. 
The reason why we should support this rule is simply because we need those young and talented people from all over the world to help build United States, to keep United States as competitive as always. 
It is ridiculous and stupid that some people would think "They took the job from US citizens". The reason those great students are hired is because they are GOOD, and those big companies CANNOT find enough qualified US citizens to do the job. That's it, nothing more.
If United States just kick those kids out when they finish their studies in United States, America would lost its competitiveness in the world.
Besides all that, United States should also provide more H1B to STEM students! Because United States need them. It does nothing with who took who's jobs, just because as a free country, we NEED them.
