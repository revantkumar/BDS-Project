I fully support this proposal. This new rule will be good for both foreign STEM students and US Economy. Stem students are valuable resources for Tech companies. They will indirectly contribute a lot to US economy. Moreover, It allows international students to have more time to practice and apply their skills to professional settings and gain experiences.
