I am writing in support of this proposal. The thought that this extension will take away the citizen's job opportunities is definitely short-sighted. On contrary, the hired international students are well educated and trained. They are able to take jobs and complete it up very well. I believe that their contribution to the US economy will create more jobs for the citizens, rather than detriment their wages.
