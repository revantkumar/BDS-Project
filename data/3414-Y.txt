I do not agree with the opinion of Larry Farries that OPT should not be extended to 3 years. Although it is true that extending OPT from one year to three years expends the pool of available workers, citizens still have huge advantages over foreigners when finding a job. 

I recently graduated with Master's degree in Statistics. It was the two American students in our department who got their jobs before graduation. Most of the foreign students struggled to find a job even after the graduation. Our program also provides intern opportunities to the second-year graduate students, but not all of us can get this intern. Those two American students are two of the students who interned during the second year. Similar situation happens to the previous students. Some foreign students couldn't find a job and went back to their home country. But I never heard of an American who couldn't find a job after they graduate.

In my opinion, companies definitely prefer to hire American students. First, they have better communication skills since they are native speakers. Although the science majors don't require lots of communication skills at work, the job is still part of the business and a better communication absolutely make a candidate stands out during the interview. Second, foreign students only have a few years eligibility to work in the U.S. So why the company wants to hire someone who has so much uncertainty instead of someone whose family and friends are around here and he/she can work at this position as long as he/she wants?

OPT needs to be extended to three years. No company wants to spend training cost to someone who can only work for one year. If there is only one year of OPT, it almost equals to zero because most of the foreign students couldn't find a one-year job and they will go home. Then the so-called training process is meaningless.
