According to my own experience in STEM area, few Americans are working in these fields and internation students do a good job in related STEM projects. 

I think this police is very good for U.S. First, few Americans take STEM jobs which means foreigners wouldn't decrease the working opportunities for Americans in these fields. Second, industry that is important for U.S. need those foreign students to contribute their talent and make American industry better.
