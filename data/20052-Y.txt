I highly support this RULE, international high tech students is highly demanded.

I am an entrepreneur off west coast. I need a data scientist and I actually made two bars, the basic requirement allows master graduate and a pay of 110K. And for preferred requirement, I need a PHD graduate. Among all the 2000 applicants. Less than 5 percent of all the candidates are natives but to my disappointed, none of them qualified. I have to pick the candidate from the PHD pool and I found international students are quite competitive. It is really very hard to pick a candidate if there were no international students because nowadays very few American kids have an advanced degree in STEM. 

Actually it makes nonsense for us to send over jobs to offshore company. For startups, communication and efficiency is very important. We are more likely to recruit American student. But MORE IMPORTANTLY, we need to compete with foreign companies. For some roles like accounting and sales, we already make constraints on citizenship. We can see that foreign students already help us to fight back the jobs. Isn't it?
