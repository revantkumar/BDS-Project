I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. It is the diversity and freedom which make US great.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International students can help enhance the average academic and industrial levels and make contributions to the US.
