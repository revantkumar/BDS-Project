I support this new OPT extension rule. 
I'm currently working as a data analyst/researcher in US. The monitoring and evaluation projects we work on usually last 2-3 years or even longer. Many international students trained in top-tier universities in the US are really competitive in terms of professional knowledge and skills. However, few organization would want to hire and spend enormous time and effort mentoring and training a fresh graduate, knowing that they would face the conundrum of having to let the person go due to the expiration of his/her OPT status. VISA issue and legal working status of those foreign candidates would always be an obstacle to treating all candidates equally regardless of their nationality or to hiring the best candidate for the job. 
"All men are created equal" is our motto. "Fairness and justice" is what we live for. Having OPT extension for the international students with adequate education and skills is not only align with our belief in equity and equality, but also lead to a win-win situation where companies would truly follow their heart and choose the best man completely based on their skills and capability, and the students would have the opportunity to put into practice what they've learnt in US and contribute to the community/company.
Thanks.
