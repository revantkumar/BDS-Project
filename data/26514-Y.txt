I highly support this rule based on following reasons. 

1) Everyone who educated in US should have the opportunity to work in US.

2) Every talents in high-tech field or any other field should have the opportunity to work in US, isn't this how US become the best country in the world at first place?

3) Is not that STEM students take away jobs from native americans, is just that most of americans doesn't like engineering related major. Take a look at all the computer science class and electrical engineering class, how many native americans can you find there?

4) Most importantly, don't forget American Dream!! That is something your father, your father's father believes, or maybe your grand grand father believed. Without that, there will not be United States!
