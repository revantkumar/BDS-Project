I strongly SUPPORT this rule because:
1. It's good for US economy to have talented foreigner to work in the STEM fields. otherwise, US economy would face huge losses if they are not allowed to stay long.
2. It's good for US education. Longer OPT will attract more talented students to come and contribute to US.
3. This rule will greatly benefit the US economy and US companies, so I strongly SUPPORT it.
