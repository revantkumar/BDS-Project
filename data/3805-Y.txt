I think the new OPT extension rule is intended to benefit the economy and technology development in U.S. The OPT helps companies to find great employees all over the world and these foreign people bring diverse culture into U.S. If we can extend the OPT, it will definitely give tech company more chance to find suitable employee, and decrease the risk that great foreign employee may get lost because of the visa issue. Based on the above reasons, I strongly approve of the new extension rule for OPT.
