I think the expanding for OPT is a good idea. Those international students especially those who have Ph.D degrees are mainly working in high technique area. These areas are requiring more and more labor today but can not be fulfilled by only Americans. 

We trained them for a long time and kicked them away. It is not clear doing this. They should work and provide their talent skills after receiving such a long time training provided by us.
