I am a Chinese student currently studying in the US, and I would like to argue for a favorable consideration for a 24 month OPT extension. International students, being trained and received primary in their homeland, is a source of costless free trained labor for the currently booming tech industry. However, many complains that it is hard finding employment since 1. They could only guarantee work for 1 year periods and 2. After the end of the one year period, H1B is a hassle for both the employer and the worker. The current OPT period tips the labor market unfavorable to both US companies and foreign workers, causing inefficiency in the market.
