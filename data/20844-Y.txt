I strongly support this proposed rule. Many negative comments are based on the idea of "many well-qualified Americans will be losing job opportunities because of this new OPT extension policy". First, please define well-qualified. Are you saying that companies are in favor of foreigners when they can hire an equivalent American for doing the same thing? I do not believe so. Looking around in substantial companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Oracle and etc., they are looking for brightest college graduates who are capable of being helpful for the future of the company, the future of America, and the future of our world! They are hiring and selecting bright new college graduates based on their ability, instead of the color of skin, or the nationality, which is exactly the thing we should be doing when we put the benefits of the world in the first place. The world is not only America, the world is consisted of a lot of countries, a lot of people with different background. We shall always bear the future of our world in our mind instead of a short-term country goal.
