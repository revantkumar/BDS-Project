I am in favor with this improving and expanding training opportunities. It is a great policy so that the excellent graduates of STEM can have the chance to work for the US companies, which is also a way contributes to the US's economy. The US government should offer more chances with those who are competitive and who can make great contributions to America. What's more, everyone should be treated equally and this is America, the land of freedom.
