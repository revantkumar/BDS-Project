I don't see the point at all why STEM OPT could affect citizen employment. Obviously, STEM students will take the positions that requires a lot of technical expertise and many citizens are not willing to do. If the companies did not fall short of employees with STEM expertise, this OPT extension thing wouldn't be initiated at the beginning.
