-International students have been a very important group of people to support many high tech industries in the United States. It will be a great loss to a bunch of famous American Companies once then extension policy is canceled. And that will impact the economy of USA for sure.
- If extension no longer exists, much less international students will want to apply for schools here, the graduate programs of colleges will lose half of student and financial resource. 
- Immigration and diversity makes this country, we helped and still want to help USA to be strong if we are given equal opportunities to work and live and our efforts are appreciated in the same way.
