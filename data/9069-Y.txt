Kira Lee I totally suport to improve and expand Opt for F1 students with STEM degrees. The first reason, this policy will attracted more international students come to USA to study compare other countries. International students are a huge resource to encourage economic development. They pay much more education fees and will bring forth tourist industry.Some people may think these international students will stay USA and take the job opportunities from US citizens. Actually, it is still a lot of limits for those international students to find a job compare US citizens. They only can apply certain companies with certain type of job. Besides, H1B visa is the determinant to control the number of immigrant's job opportunity every year; there are not over 85,000 H1B visas can be issued every year. Expanding training opportunities for F1 students will not change the number of working visa.
