As a new international graduate student, I strongly agree with this action. 
I chose US to pursue my degree mainly because it has the OPT and extensions for international students to gain industry experience after their commencement. If the U.S. government and universities would like to attract international students with increasing tuition fees, they should provide a promising future by policy. Without OPT extensions, many international students may consider other countries to pursue their degrees, such as Canada, UK, Australia, Singapore, etc. Most of the countries or regions mentioned above have fewer tuition fees and open arms to international students with friendly immigration policy. 
One year of experience is far from enough for not only students but also U.S. companies. For example, my company just submitted a proposal in a project and it would not start until May next year. If I have to leave U.S. because of cancellations in OPT extension, the company has to find a replacement (maybe a U.S. citizen), but whoever he or she is, it takes a huge amount of time to get familiar with the project. 
It is unfair that the government cancels OPT extension without notice and reasonable proof. I strongly agree that OPT extension should be 24 months.
