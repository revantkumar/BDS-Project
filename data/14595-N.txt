The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers. US Census Bureau data show that roughly 11.4 million of 15 million Americans with science, technology, engineering and math degrees aren't working in so-called STEM fields. The crisis is not a lack of high-skilled workers, but a lack of high-skilled job openings. Employment site Bright.com found 4.08 American job candidates for every one electronics-engineering job listed as an H-1B position. Meanwhile, foreign guest workers account for one-third to one-half of all new IT hires.
