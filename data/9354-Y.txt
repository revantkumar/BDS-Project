I strongly support this new OPT action since it is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. On one side, US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.

Besides, native friends of mine graduated from STEM also find well-paid jobs in tech companies. U.S. tech companies are wanting for high quality employees, no matter native or international students. That's why OPT benefits U.S. most.
