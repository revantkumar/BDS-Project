I support this proposal. I think international students should make contribution to the US because we receive pretty good education here. Except that, we provide good competitions with native Americans. We both improve ourselves in the career. We learn very hard in the US and we truly have great achievements in our jobs. So I think US also need us international students. We want to make contributions to the US and we also need the US provide our opportunities.
