I strongly support this rule and hope it will be finalized soon. 

As a international student, I saw many non-STEM field students who went back to their country after OPT ends simply because they are not allowed to work in US legally. In non-STEM field, I admit that native born do a better job than internationals for variety of reasons, including cultural, social and economical. But in STEM field, U.S. need international students and they contribute large amount of work force. And scientists and engineers are always in large demand. 

If the STEM extension is revoked or shortened, it will discourage internationals students to come to US and universities will hardly accomplish their academic goals. Further, high tech companies will be much less productive and in consequence economy will collapse. We don't need to put much emphasis on how much silicon valley contributes to U.S. economy, right? Nobody wants to experience the economic regression again.

Now I work in one of the great companies in bay area. Many colleagues with OPT/STEM OPT works here and the company continues to hiring them. If they had to leave U.S., guess who will benefit, eventually?

This proposed rule will finally benefit U.S. economy and create more job opportunities for both native borns and internationals.
