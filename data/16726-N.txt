A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two facts about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand: 1) OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 and 2) OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

Many American students work hard through college, their parents sacrifice to send them to a good school in order to get a good job and they often have big loans when they graudate. Our country needs to give these American students the jobs. Please take care of our country and our citizens first.

The money Social Security and Medicare has lost also hurts American citzens who are on Social Security and those who will one day need to receive Social Security.

Please put the needs of hard working American students and citzens first and foremost.

Thank you,
Jennifer Marriott
