Patricia Garner The STEM OPT extension is very beneficial policy that should be strongly supported. 
The policy will help the U.S. to retain well-educated STEM OPT students, whichis huge human capital gains. Since the STEM students learn the advanced skills and knowledge from U.S. prestigious universities, if the U.S. government can retain more STEM foreign students, it means the U.S. can gain more human capital. Under current H1-B visa lottery process, with more and more inflows of foreign students but not changed quota in the H1-B pool, it becomes harder and harder for the STEM students to win the lottery and stay in the U.S. This leads to a great lost of human capital. According to Romer theory of revised Solow Model for explaining the role of technology change in economic growth, human capitals available for technological research plays a very important part of spurring the technological change. The STEM OPT extension will enable the well-educated STEM OPT students to get a bigger chance of winning the lottery and continuing contributing to the U.S. technological and economic growth.
