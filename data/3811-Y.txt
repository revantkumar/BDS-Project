I highly support this action.
Firstly, extending the OPT for F1 student could improve the economics I the States as most of the companies hire the foreign employee who need the working permit. These jobs need a lot of labor who has high education degree.
Secondly, the well educated people should have choice to stay for several years to contribute for the country. They are excellent and smart people. They got the opportunity to get the best education here in the States. They need to contribute for the States by staying here to work for the States for a while before going back to contribute their own country.
Lastly, according to the spirit of United States, people should have freedom to work reasonably here to contribute the country.
