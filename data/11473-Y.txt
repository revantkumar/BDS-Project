If this law came in action will result in thousands of more Indian Chinese and foreign nationals coming to USA for studies, those who can make up to good university are an asset for any country but those who are just looking for a way to come to USA will take admission in any university and study anything join any consultant and get a job and then h1b and will stay here as long as they can.
If companies seriously want foreign nationals to work for them they should work on getting quality education to students making good bonds to good university and all other things.
More foreign nationals more lucky draws more chances of loosing a good talent 
Don't increase stem period but make sure anyone who is worth get an opportunity.
Foreigners no doubt take opportunity away from American citizens.
DON'T MAKE IMMIGRATION EASY.
