Vineet Pasupulety What is extremely important to understand is that when you train us and allow us to take up jobs in your country, you are boosting your economy. Indians represent a very small proportion of the population of the USA, but are still able to generate thousands of jobs every year for the US economy, which is exactly what is required for the growth of your country. Besides being a superpower, the US has a generic duty to help uplift the world economy as a whole. Offering such jobs to immigrants gives us a chance to not only help our country in some way, but to also improve the brand image of the US has a country that is a wellwisher for all. Also, a country that is considered amongst the free and best countries to live in will obviously encourage diversity in its population to allow development socially and economically. Another point to note is that when we pour in so much money to pursue STEM degrees, isn't it morally incorrect to snatch away the return on investment that we hope for by sending us back? To actually apply what we learn and take it back to our home, don't we require experience to apply that knowledge in an industrial setting? And considering we come from developing countries, do you think the infrastructure to apply our knowledge is available? And if immigrants are smart, is it our fault that the rest of the population is unable to get jobs? The root cause is that most of the local population don't spend enough time on learning and while it away in activities that cause them to suffer later on in life (statistics are available all over the internet). You should counsel them at an early age in schools about ethics, not cut out smart people from abroad who are helping you build your economy and in turn giving jobs to several locals. Tackle the root and not some random leaf on the plant when it is diseased. Please allow the extension of OPT, for a lot of people's lives and entire economies, are hanging in the balance.
