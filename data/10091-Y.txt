I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. I think extending the OPT period will allow more really great students work in US and make contribution to US. And this would not only promote the development of US's technology industry, help enhance economy of US, but also will attract more talented foreign students and make the society better.
2. I believe the OPT extension will attract excellent students to America to study, and this will definitely make contribution to the enrollment of university and will also make the society of US more diverse. As we know, diversity of US is very important, it's one of the greatest elements in US and it would make the whole country better and more forward.
3. The OPT extension will not influence the work condition of Americans, because the majors which allow OPT extension are actually science, technology and math related majors. And jobs in these fields actually need a large amount of employees. However, the local Americans couldn't fill all of the job positions, so hiring foreign students is a good choice to the industry and the country. And at the same time, local Americans could still find great jobs because this industry need more people than we thought before, and it's still developing very fast.
