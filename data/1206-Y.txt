This propose is a good decision. Nowdays, if we take a look at the graduate department in every university, especially for some difficult science majors (math, computer science, biology, chemistry, etc), about half of them are international students. A large proportion of them are showing their strong background and would bring powerful knowledge to contribute to the US scentific and engineer innovation. Moreover, the position for these group of students, who need OPT and STEM extensions, are not in conflict with US tech workers. These students majorly focuses on science majors and companies need them as there are not enough US employees on these majors.
