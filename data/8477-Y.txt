I am one of approximately 500,000 US citizens, trained engineers, put of out work by actions like this.

This proposed rule does not address the cost to USA taxpayers, in lost jobs, SSI payments (free pensions, HUD housing, Medicare) imposed on the taxpayer after family reunification after obtaining green cards), for does it quantify or address the cost to STEM students who pay for an education but cannot find work using the skills they paid for.

Economist Milton Friedman called H-1B, and programs such as this designed to circumvent limits on H-1B visas, "welfare for millionaires". And that is what this is.

These programs have been replacing US workers since the 1990s, and yet the condition of US technology is worse today than it was when Bill and Hillary Clinton found out that you can get millions from socializing the cost of labor for billionaires.

No DOL study has ever shown a lack of workers ready to take jobs in the tech industry.

Th National Science Foundation has said that programs like this depress wages and cause some of the best US students to turn away from STEM careers.

I interviewed at DHS for a job as an Oracle database administrator. 100% of the technical staff that interviewed me appeared to be, and spoke like they were foreign born. As soon as the saw me, they announced that the job had been changed to only two days, every other week.

I also applied at Fanny Mae, and SAIC. In each case the people conducting the interview were 100% foreign born and did not appear to be the least bit interested in what I said, even though I not only knew how to work with the Oracle database, I had worked at Oracle with Tom Kyte, an expert in Oracle known world wide.

I asked Tom if his children would go into developing as we had, he said, "No, there is no longer any place for US citizens in developing technology. I note that he is a vice-president at Oracle.

YOu are trashing this country to benefit billionaires.
