I have completed MS in Computer Science. I paid around 20k college fees. I am doing job in IT field since last 9 months. I support 24 months OPT because it would allow me to get 2nd chance to file H1b. H1b process is a Lottery base process and if you are really lucky, you get selected or else your whole year will be wasted. For me, my OPT is going to expire in Feb 2016 so I may not get 2nd chance. I am not taking anybody's job, I am getting job in which american's are not being selected. If America will not allow skilled workforce to leverage their knowledge & skill for this country then they will go somewhere else and apply their skill & knowledge. There will be silicon velly in another countries.
Above is my personal opinion, the decision will be yours. Thanks.
