Jessica Lee I strongly support this new rule. This proposed rule has clear statement on how to ensure foreign students get practical training, that will still focus on their majors. I see nothing in the article that places foreigners before domestic students. I don't understand why people are worried and upset with student Visa foreigners having their training period. After all, STEM jobs are on high demand, there are companies afford this training, and there are companies don't. I don't see companies reject U.S. workers only because they offer this training to foreign students, at least in Silicon Valley.
