Strongly SUPPORT this proposal.

More and more students with STEM degrees are nonimmigrant students at these days. They contributes with the U.S society for long time already. With the immigration topic becomes popular, the regulation with F-1 students should make adjustment as well. Considering the growth of development and jobs opportunity, expanding OPT for F1 STEM student will grow a benign competition environment, not malignant pressure to the U.S citizens. I believe the U.S government can consider this proposal from long-term benefit.
