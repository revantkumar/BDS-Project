I've seen some americans strongly disagree with this policy, that does not make sense. If a country want to lead a world wide trend, it has to know the disparity between itself and other countries. If some americans think reduce the number of foreigners can reduce the competition, they are totally wrong, because after several decades, they will be so surprised to find out that other countries have climbed over U.S.
