Good rules will benefit US STEM fields. For example, some essential programs or projects in companies will need 2-3 years to finish. One year OPT leaves a big problem behind for the companies to find new employees filling up the positions, also costs companies a lot of time to train new employees. For now, many F-1 students are applying for H1B or green card because of the short time working experience using OPT. But with 3 years OPT, they are not gonna need the H1B to gain enough working experiences. US will face less immigrants from F-1 students and the citizens won't lose jobs because of new immigrants. Besides that, many F-1 students got scholarships during their study in US. If they graduate and directly go back to their home country with the good education and high-level techniques. It will be a huge loss for US.
