Jun Liu Dear Sir or Madam,

Just like one year OPT has helped so many students find and establish their current career, the extension of OPT is very important for many students who can not find a stable job at the beginning or failed to obtain H1B status in time. Those students, who choose to stay in US, believe and value that they can do better in US. Why not give them the chance to build a better society? 

If we force them leave US in such a way, I guess less and less good students would choose to study in US, since they can not have a bright future after graduation. Without so many good students, US may lose its leadership in many technologies and some industries. If we want to keep the technology, we would also have to keep the people who has the potential to invent and develop them.

Thank you for consideration.
