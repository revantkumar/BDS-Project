F1 PhD students and even postdocs are in a very difficult situation. On one hand they have to struggle day and night with hard work in the lab and focus on their publications, on the other hand they always think they will be kicked out of the country after graduation. Since most of the research areas are very new they can not find available positions in their home country. Please help these people to focus on their research work without worrying about being kicked out of the country. This will eventually help the country and improve quality of work.
