I strongly agree that OPT should be extended longer for F1 STEM students.

U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. For example, Uber need Chinese students to help improve its Chinese market.

I don't understand why many Americans disagree with the extension policy. Don't you want a better economy in the US?
