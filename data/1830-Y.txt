I strongly support this new regulation for OPT extension.
However, I think only those international students who have a master's or PhD's degree in the field of STEM should be qualified for this OPT extension.
Mostly undergraduate students are from local, and most graduate students are international. If the OPT extension is only for graduate or PhD international students, it will be an impulsion for American students to study harder and an employment security for American undergraduates.
