Han Li I don't understand why some people are upset about this extension. The OPT students are not the cause of immigration, employment rate, or any other sensitive problems U.S. has. Actually, this group of people is not the reason why people are feeling not keeping their jobs. Take a look at those out sourcing consulting company, you will be shocked by the numbers of those company out source directly to another country, That is the real problem. 
I'm totally supporting this regulation.
