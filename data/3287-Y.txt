Aria Lin This proposed rule is a win-win outcome.The F1 students which have STEM degrees,they can have a oppotunity to work at US.On the other hand,these F1 nonimmigrants students,what they do are all for the development of US.If they can find a job here,that because they are good workers.Why not to give both them and US a chance?I support this propesed rules!
