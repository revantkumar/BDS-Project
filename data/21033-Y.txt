United States is formed by a group of smart immigrations. Attracting smart students from all of the world is a way to keep United States being a pioneer in all different fields. Extending OPT is a great way to keep this traditional foundation of a nation. Elon Musk was a foreign student with a F-1 visa back in days. He found paypal, solar city, tesla, and all other incredible companies which provides countless jobs in U.S. He is a U.S. citizen now. I don't think he can achieve this without a program called OPT.
