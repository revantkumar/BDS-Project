As a international student in the U.S. I strongly support the proposal. 
I chose to study here is because the U.S. is so nice to provide international students not only the chance to study, but the chance to work and gain practical experience. 
Everyone knows it is hard for a student to get his/her very first job/internship, for a science student, like me, working for my research advisor is a very good opportunity. However, professors usually working on projects last at least 1 years, plus proposal stage, a 24 month OPT is a minimum requirement for a science student to participate in a project. 
For the professors, it is also a good thing to have science students were worked in his/her own lab working for his/her project. The good collaboration can strongly improve the working efficiency and make the result better. If the OPT does not have enough time for a international student to finish a project, it will definitely bother to find another new student/researcher to fill in, and it will definitely delay the progress of research projects.
