I am strongly support the 24-month STEM OPT extension policy. Now I am a 4-year PhD in Mechanical Engineering of a Top 10 university in U.S. If there is no OPT extension, I'll have to only work one year in U.S. and then go back to my own country. It would be a big talent loss to my future employer since they waste their 1-year training and need to recruit the new employee to fill out my position. Also it would be a big talent loss to U.S. since high technology student with excellent working experience will flow out, which would be benefit to their own country, however, definitely not a wise move for the economy growth of the United States.
