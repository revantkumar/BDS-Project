R.J. Bradner It is imperative that NO Islamic students or workers be considered for immigration into the USA. In fact, no Islamic individuals should be allowed on US soil. Islam is NOT a religion; it is a political, legal, economic, militaristic and cultural way of life that is diametrically opposed to Western Civilization and Culture. Islam is anti-America in all things and has no place in America. 

More so, this program should be focused upon developing American born US Citizens who could and would fit these jobs more appropriately. 

The Establishment Repubs support these visas because it is cheap for business to underpay foreign workers. The Socialist Dems and Libtards support these foreign workers/students because they are against all things America and seek to make yet another of the worlds 3rd world socialist dung heaps. 

We American Patriots are against these visas because we are PRO-America. We need the jobs. Black, White, Red, Yellow or Brown Americans should come FIRST. 

There are plenty of needy and qualified Americans who should be considered firstly and solely.
