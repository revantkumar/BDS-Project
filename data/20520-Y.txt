I strongly agree to implement this rule. here are my reasons for the support.

1. This will be greatly beneficial for students on stem degrees as they can work here and ultimately this helps in improved US economy
2. Students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.
3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
4.As an international student I came to US to learn and to get good knowledge by working here for few years. If this rule doesn't implemented then this will also for sure effect in future students coming to US .
