I strongly support this action.
1)If the STEM extension was canceled, enormous elites who have not had a H1B visa will be forced to leave the work they love and forced to be out of work. This situation will not only be a disaster for these hard-working F-1 students, but also cause tremendous harm to technology companies. 
2)These students have created nothing but contribution to STEM fields and they improved the living environment of U.S people, it would be a trample on human rights to force them to leave their work.
3)What is more, we are not talking about thousands people here, a large portion of tech company engineers will be forced to leave the U.S, and it is hard to fill all the companies in short time. 
Terminating STEM extension will definitely cause harm to economy, and as we know, the economy nowadays needs more stimulate rather than a hit. 
Based on above, I strongly support this action.
