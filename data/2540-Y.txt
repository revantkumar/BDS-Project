Tim Xu It's a great choice for us to support longer stem opt extension. Not only for USA, but for the whole world will benefit from this because these people are well educated, with talent and skills in IT, eletrical engineering, chemistry field. These people are the future of Silicon Valley, Wall Street,tones of great labs. These people require good environment to grow up and create next Facebook, Uber, Yahoo...

USA is a great country and have lots of great engineers and scientists fulfill their goals. I suggest government keep doing the right thing and help these students get stem opt extended.
