I think you are really short-sighted, you must know that America is the first country to own a atomic bomb, when you are proud of this you must be ignoring that most of the scientists behind were emigrated from other countries. Maybe you don't know many, but you must know Einstein, was he American? If Einstein could only stay in America for one year, can you have the first atomic bomb? Daydream!
