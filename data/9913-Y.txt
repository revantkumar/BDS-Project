It is bad enough to support immigrants with government handouts. But to assist non immigrants with training so they can gain practical experience in STEM fields? What about the American workers passed over in favor of someone who is supposed to be trained to return to their own countries taking their knowledge and skills with them? America didn't lead the industrial revolution by sending our knowledge to our competing countries. It makes no sense to enable the rest of the world to surpass ourselves.
