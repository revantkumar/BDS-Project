I believe contributions by international students is not recognized enough by certain people in the US. They have mistaken it to political favoritism. When an American student has studied the same course that an international student then the employer without a doubt will hire the American. Simply because they can rely on him. International students do not take over American's jobs. They just venture into jobs that require their contribution. Definitely securing OPT in a company is not a piece of cake for the international students and this proposition should encourage them. I support the proposition.
