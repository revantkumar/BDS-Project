Qipei Li To whom it may concern:

I am a recent graduate student with a Master degree earned in Biomedical Sciences field at one state-run university in United States. I will start my work at a research laboratory that is related to my field of study under Post Completion OPT status soon (November 2, 2015). What my new employer (PI at the laboratory) concerns is that I only got an authorized work period for 12 months at first time, but her upcoming projects require someone who can work 3-5 years for completion. Thus, she hopes that I would not leave this position after exposure to practical training work experience for one or two years. Taken together, if it increases STEM OPT extension to 24 months, it will not only encourage these nonimmigrant students to enhance their knowledge and skills in a related STEM field, but assuage their U.S. employers concerns about employment of STEM OPT students.

Yours sincerely,
