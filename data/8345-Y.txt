I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for following reasons:

1, Those who have studied in American universities have, are and will make important contributions to the U.S., and the U.S. government should continue encourage this.

2, Competition encourage people to work hard. This is undoubtedly good for U.S. society.

3, For so many companies, to expand themselves and correspond to globalization, ideas of people from different cultures are necessary and indispensable.
