Guohong Yang (1) The International student body is large, but not large enough to compare or compete with the American work force. International students should not be blamed for the unemployment rate; there are many other factors to be blamed for.

(2) Even though a longer OPT might be granted, the unchanged fact is that only the most smart and able International students can stay and work in the United State. Having more high-end work force in US energizes the industries, and even the whole country. How will the high-tech industries become if no International students ever participate in their development? Needless to mention, the US does not have to pay any of the fees necessary for supporting an infant to grow into a ready-to-work adult.

(3) Repelling the competent International students equivalently increases the competing forces against the US industries, since they will finally go to the same industries in other countries.

(4) Once International students get the working offers, they become tax payers paying similar amount of tax without receiving most benefits that US citizens get.

(5) International students are not illegal immigrants. International students come to the US not only for prosperity, but also for the American dream, for a better country, and for a better world.

In summary, there are strong reasons that more opportunities (OPT extension) should be granted for the International students, considering and comparing with the current situations.
