I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First, the industry training chance is the most attractive area that I choose to further my study in America not Hong Kong, Britain or German.Therefore, OPT is an important factor to attract foreign talent students.

Furthermore, renting house in the long term will be more costly than buying a house. With so many students need the house and they must rent the house around the school, it will definitely promote the American economy. 

Finally, I can be accepted by companies more easily in my country with the longer intern experience.
