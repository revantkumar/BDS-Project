I support the rule of the extension of OPT.

I am an international graduate student at a top US university in an engineering major. Even I do not have the right to vote for this rule, since I am one of the many students who are closely impacted by it, I would like to have my comments as follows:

1. Open and competition create more energetic economics, rather than close and narrow-protection. If there is anything I learned about the economics from both the rise of US since WWI, or the Chinese successful economic reform in the last four decades, that is the energy and creativity released by the people in an open and competitive environment. Refuse the extension of OPT that reducing the opportunities of international STEM students, for sure is opposing above direction.

2. Talented and hard-working people will always find their places and opportunities, no matter where it is in the world. However, if the US OPT policy refused to extend, it shows the unfriendly attitude to new graduated international students, which will draw more concerns as whether US is still a sound option with good enough developing opportunities. 


3. Open and energetic environment creates more jobs and more opportunities. The comments against this rule are limited by the wrong idea, that the number of STEM jobs are constant or bounded. However the truth is, the more people who are actively involved in STEM related area, the more creative and prosperous the job market will be.

Anyway, this is a policy that reflects whether US would like to attract more talented immigrants on high level technologies, or want to be protectionist and push them away. 

Thanks,
Alan
