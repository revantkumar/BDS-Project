I don't understand why people are so against it. The students study at school and deserve extra opportunities to gain real world exp. They came with different backgrounds and cultures and contribute to the diversity at school and our society. I enjoy talking with and learning from my co-workers at my company. Most of them are OPT students. They show their talent, manner, and hardworking spirits that I think most of younger generations now days need to learn.
