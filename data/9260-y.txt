James Amerson I support this proposal because I believe this extension of OPT may bring new growth in economy for United States. As we all know, internet and cutting-edge technology is merging and it seems not going to end. It started a revolution on traditional industries and taking place in many services. If America wants to keep the leading position in this field, we must keep the foreign students and workers who have been highly educated to create more jobs, not taking jobs from US citizens, but creating more jobs for US.
