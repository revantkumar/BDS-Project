OPT as well as H1B are essential for U.S. economical growth!

We want to keep all the elites no matter where they are from to work for the U.S after they graduate from college. Let all these experts in different fields to go back to their home countries will eventually cause U.S. to lose its leading position in the world!

U.S. needs to open its job market for everybody! U.S. needs competition in its job market. As a result, canceling the OPT extension will not solve the problem at all. Instead, it will only cause U.S. economy to move from bad to even worse! Let's vote for OPT extension!
