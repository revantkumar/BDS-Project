Yang Liu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. This proposal is not only for the benefit of STEM international student, but also for the benefit of United States. 
For one thing, I think it's for the benefit of the education system of United States. Nowadays, one of the important reasons why the universities in United States can attract international students is that students can be authorized to work after graduation. As we all know, industrial experience is an integral part of education and even for some people is the goal of education. United States is always proud of its OPT policy that allows students to work after graduation. United States also has enjoyed the benefits of this policy with so many international students choose to go to US rather than United Kingdom, Germany, etc, which also have universities of high academic level and even longer history. It is undoubtedly that many students choose United States because they think they can put what they learn into practice in the industry after graduation, and United States can offer them a better industry practice than the other countries. Now if the OPT period is reduced to just one year which is obviously not enough for new graduates, many international students would rather choose to stay in their own countries or go to Europe or other countries. And we know some of these countries are actively issuing new policies to attract international students. This will definitely do harm to United States' education system, which has laid the basis for US's leading position for so many years. Looking back the histories we know education is always the prerequisite of the rise of a country. US's education system has attracted numerous talented students around the world, and these people helped to bring about US's prosperity for one century. The is the essential reason of the rise of United States, which should never be neglected. All in all, I strongly support the proposal.
