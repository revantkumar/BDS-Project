ni Donegan We need to thank to the international talents who made great contributions to this country. US need these talents. Why not give them more chances after graduating from the US universities. 
This is NOT making international workers over the US ones, Many companies hire the US only employees, those who declare that this policy will do great harm to the US workers are not the one who is NOT really work hard. Believe me, it is much much more easier for a US citizens to find a suitable job than anyone else from other countries. 
Again, this is the STEM extension, STEM is the foundation of this country, it is one of the key elements. 
So I strongly support this rule. Thanks.
