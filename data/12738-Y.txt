I support this rule, I still don't understand why the skilled labors are being distinguished in to these categories. If a Foreign STEM Student is getting hired, it shows that there are not enough Americans available with that Skill set. Instead of fighting against the rule why don't these people go learn something useful. We Foreign Stem Students are actually helping the US in far better ways, So stop sulking.
