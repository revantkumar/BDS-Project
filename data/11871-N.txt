I do not want the U.S. Federal Government to allow any foreigners to take any jobs that American citizens are willing to take or American citizens can be trained for. I do not want Federal money spent on any foreigners that are on any type of visas or in the country illegally. I want a 25 year moratorium put on all immigration stopping any foreigners coming to this country except for tourist and business visas.I want strict enforcement of U.S immigration laws and border laws and any illegal non-citizen foreigner found in the United States be deported immediately. Absolutely no employment for non-citizens, illegal aliens, and foreigners. No welfare benefits for anyone who is not an American citizen.
