I support the proposal.

The duration of an extension would be set at 24 months, rather than limited to a shorter period, due to the complexity and typical durations of research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields. Affording greater participation in STEM training through changes to the period of the STEM OPT extension would also help the nation and its academic institutions remain competitive in light of global efforts offering international students longer post-study training experience without restrictions on the type of work that may be performed. 

As I'm a foreign STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back my country eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.
