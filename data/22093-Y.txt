I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. These international students can devote themselves to build a stronger America. Companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple need them to compete with companies from other country. If we expel them back to their own country, they will utilize their knowledge to help companies on other countries. American companies might be less competitive than these companies.

2. If we cancel the support, there will be less and less international students from other countries which will cause less income for every universities. And then universities are not able to support so many professors and research projects, which affect our universities' influence in the world.

3. If we cancel the support, the economy will become worse and there will be fewer jobs for Americans as well. So, it is impossible that international students occupy a large number of jobs which cause Americans much hard to find a job. On the other hand, one of the reason why America is the most powerful country in the world is that it attract a large number of international students.
