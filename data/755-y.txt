Xinran Liu I strongly support the proposal since I am a graduate student with the major in chemistry. I heard many international students who graduated already benefited from the OPT STEM and contributed a lot to the U.S. companies. Some of them conducted successful research in a company and made more profits for the company. Without the OPT STEM, they would not have chance to show their talents and to contribute to the scientific innovation in industry.
