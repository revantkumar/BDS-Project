The United States is an immigrant country. For those who oppose it, please think about your ancestors (your grandparents, your great grandparents) I believe a lot of them are immigrants too. It is the immigrant that strived the country in the past and the fact still hold true now and in the future. Opposing the OPT extension rule for reasons of hurting citizens' employment opportunity is SHORT SIGHTED. Given that the TECH industry is the major engine of the US economy, talented STEM students will contribute to it to keep up the economy, and thus drive the other industries to thrive, leading to more employment opportunities overall. It is kind of silly to provide first-class education to foreign students and then send them back to their home countries to create innovations, businesses and more to compete with the US. Canada knows this and quickly react with more friendly rules for international students, while the US is trying to do the reverse actions. The OPT extension rule will only provide more benefits than hurts to the US economy overall!! Therefore, I strongly SUPPORT it!
