Based on my personal experience, I strongly support this proposal since I do see the contributions that have been made to my company by graduates in OPT status.

They are very creative and energetic on new ideas and working very hard to implement them. They usually have accepted some kind of high-level education from another culture, which will have them think without be limited by old routines. In addition, they are admitted to US universities' programs from numerous applicants and graduate with good GPA. Their capabilities, skills and knowledge are valuable for US industry. What they need is time for them to transfer what they have in their minds to real productivity. What a pity it is if they have to stop in the middle of a project!
