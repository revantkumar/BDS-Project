As a Graduate Student in Coastal & Ocean Engineering in 1981, I could not get an opportunity even though I applied to several Firms and the biggest impediment was the lack of immigration support, and eventually left the US upon graduation. Why is the US not interested in accepting trained Graduate Masters and Ph. D. Holders, whose research work is itself largely supported by Government or Industry Research Grants?
