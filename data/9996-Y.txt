XInyu Diao USA needs the investment and labor force as well as intellebgence from people outside their country, due to the current immigration policy, USA has already lost some confidence of potential immigrations. The rule itself encourage stem students and convert a active message to stem students. It will has no bad influence on current job market but bring competitions and let more talents stand out. I definitely think we need to make this rule become true
