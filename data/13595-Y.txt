I strongly support this new ruling. 
1:Lots of student come to the US rather than other countries because of the benefit of OPT extension. If it is canceled, most excellent students will choose to go to Canada, UK or Australia instead which will significantly decrease the competency of US education. 

2: Stem graduates made great contribution to the development of US high tech companies, especially for student with computer science or other engineer degrees. If all these students choose to work in other countries other than US, the development of US high tech industry will be reduced.

Based on that, I think cancelling the OPT extension will significantly decrease the competency of US.
