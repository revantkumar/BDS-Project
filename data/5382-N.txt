American Citizens should always be hired over a non- US Citizen. It boggles my mind how a Government rather assist people from other Countries rather than its own people. We have too many unemployed persons in this Country, get them back to work, paying taxes, and paying into Social Security. Mire Americans working is great fir the economy, correct? Stop the Destruction if the United States!
