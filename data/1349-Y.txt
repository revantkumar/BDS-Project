Helen He I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT policy, because this policy provides many benefits. Those who are opposing this policy did not bring up valid points and I do not want these comments cause problems for such a great policy.

Firstly, foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX and they help local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge loss. Those property renting, food service and other industries will also face huge loss.

Secondly, here is no guarantee how long it will take and how much it will cost to train all US students to fully compensate loss of foreign students. There are so many highly-qualified STEM foreign students and they are valuable assets to the US companies. Without this policy, numerous companies in the United States will face serious shortage of STEM workers and it would be a tremendous loss for them.

Finally, the US consists of immigrants from the old and most of them made a huge contributions to this country. For example, lots of people came to America during The Second World War, most of them are professionals, engineers and scientists (Albert Einstein being one of them). This is why American developed so rapid and strong after the war. The STEM OPT extension rule aims to keep these American future elites, which will in return benefit the US society.

Therefore, I highly support this new policy and really hope this could be APPROVED!!!
