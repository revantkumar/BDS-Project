I am STRONGLY SUPPORT the STEM OPT extension proposal. Because I am firmly believe STEM students are using their knowledge obtained from U.S. universities to benefit U.S. economy, to make people live better lives. The OPT extension for STEM's WILL NOT hurt Americans since most of the jobs taking by STEM students are those could not or would not be finished by local workers.
