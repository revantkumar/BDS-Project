I strongly support the OPT extension policy.

1. The US economy relies on high-teck companies, which employ a large number of highly educated foreigners. These people work hard, increasing GDP and tax, which supporting the US economy.

2. International students do not take US citizens' work away. The jobs related to STEM are those jobs that native students are not willing to do, or jobs that cannot find enough US students to do. 

3. If you cancelled the OPT extension, you at least should guarantee the international student who is working now can get H1b visa. If a student can only work for one year, how can the company to find another person to substite him in a short time? The cost of keeping hiring and training new people is huge for those high-tech company.

4. Cancelling the OPT extension will undoubtedly reduce the number of international students studying in the US. Many ordinary families will also be effected. For example, there are many houses renting by international students near university campus. If only fewer international students come US, the house onwers would be difficult to find more suitable tenants then international students .
