I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. Citizens.

Stop the overreach!!! We need to take care of our American workers.
