I support the OPT extension proposal, and hope more Amercans can understand the benefits, and weight them against their worries or concerns. Many people who have made significant contributions to US were foreign students for starters, and I am among them. Yet, each year lots of foreign students have to leave US because their OPTs just fail to cover gaps between job or working visa changes. US is an immigrant country, and should give more opportunities to talent foreign students to work for the country and the Americans, after having invested on their educations. The more talents that US can bring in, the more prosperous the country can become. There have been many restrictions already on the selections of job types, employment requirements and other aspects, and therefore the worry of Americans losing their jobs is minimal, especially compared to the benefits that are brought in by the new working foreigners.
