There is no need to expand this program when the United States has the lowest employment rate in recent history. A concentrated effort to improve the opportunities for unemployed American workers is much more desirable and needed. No one can explain why this program should be expanded. Senator Charles Grassley has stated the following; "The proposed regulations are "irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it." "OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans."
There should be a demonstrated need before taking this action.
