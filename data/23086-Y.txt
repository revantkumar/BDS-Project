I do SUPPORT this extension.

This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both the U.S. technology companies and the students. For companies, it takes a few months for companies to train new employees. With this new rule, companies can hire an F-1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years, from a greenhand to an experienced one, which definitely decreases the cost to train new employees and increases the efficiency. It's good for US economy as well. For students, they can gain more experience in 3 years after graduation and will be more competitive in the future, which will attract more international students to pursue a STEM degree in the US, thus attracting more talented people and maintaining the high education quality.
