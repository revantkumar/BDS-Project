I am an international and the reasons why I chose to come to America are the fair, freedom and opportunity. Don't disappoint me. If there is no more extension for OPT, I believe fewer and fewer high-tech people will choose America in the future. Without engineers and nature science, I can hardly imagine the bad influence it will bring to America. Make the smart decision and extend OPT!!
