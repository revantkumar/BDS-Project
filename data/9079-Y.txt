I support the proposed rule. For students planning to pursue research as a post-doctoral fellow, after a PhD, one year of OPT is insufficient, as it takes minimum of 2-3 years to successfully complete a research and publish. If there is an uncertainty, students will hesitate to take up a post-doctoral opportunity, and in that case, pursuing a PhD degree in the US becomes less attractive.
