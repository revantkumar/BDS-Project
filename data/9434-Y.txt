Sumana N I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I Love contributing to Innovation and American Economy.I like the new proposed 24 months STEM OPT. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I love to see this rule published and implemented without affecting 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.I am sure we continue to en light the modern technology and innovative things in U.S.
