It is really bad to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation. I think expanding OPT is definitely great for international students. I am a householder of several international studentsif the government reject international students to work after graduation, I will be deeply influenced, because there will be less international students came here to rent my house. I am really scared. international students really contribute a lot to our country's economy. 

OPT extension is a win-win. others countries are trying to attract and maintain talents. the secret for USA stay 1st developed is that it respects diversity. we international students are only spare tires in talents marketing.
