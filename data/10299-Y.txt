It is a good idea to extend the STEM opt. International students who hold advanced degrees in US Universities usually work very hard and contribute a lot to US Economy. They help our technology companies to thrive in the world. A lot of high-tech companies may not even exist in the world without them, for example, Yahoo, which was founded by a Chinese person twenty years ago. 

For United States, one of the major belief in the country is equality. We should provide job and work positions to those who have better skills, who are more talented, who work harder. There should be no restrictions on the working visa, on whether the applicant is citizen or not.
