A lot of people are afraid they would lose jobs to these STEM students but I disagree, it's quite the opposite. A good and strong economy is what gives us more jobs, but what makes the economy better? The answer is talent, if our companies recruit the best and the brightest, they will naturally be more productive and technologically superior to their competitors in other countries. As an example, what if apple can't recruit better people to design the next iPhone? It will start to go downhill and lose market share to companies like Samsung. That's not good for the U.S. economy at all, and not just programmers will lose their jobs, apple store tech support, sales people, etc. a whole industry. Just google it "how much a new iPhone release brings to the US economy". 

They're an inflow of other countries' best talent into our universities (which I'm proud to say are the world's best) and then into producing value for the U.S. economy. Sending these bright minds home would mean not only that we lose their contribution, but exponentially more in the future. They would stop landing on our shores because they believe they are not welcome. There goes the edge that Google, Facebook, Apple, Intel, Microsoft, Amazon... has over Samsung, Sony, LG, Huawei, TSMC, Mediatek, Lenovo... There goes our high tech driven economy...
