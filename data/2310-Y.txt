OPT extension is a beneficial rule.
1. International students have paid a considerable amount of tuition to US universities and colleges. It not only supports US educational system, but also make US universities gain higher reputations in the world. Oppositely, UK universities, due to the lack of working training programs, have problems attracting international students to pour money into their universities. If the extension rule suddenly becomes obsolete, international students would tend to choose universities in countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, etc, which are nice about student working rules.
2. International students' expenditure would help US economy. Because of the difference between US price and international prices, students would tend to purchase luxuries and expensive commodities in US rather than in their own countries. There are even local businesses which rely on students, like restaurants near universities, apartments near universities. With much less international students attending universities in US, they would have much less income.
3. Former promises for international students to work for extra 19 months, if broken, negatively influence US international image. Millions of students are using OPT right now, and many of them have been granted longer time than Feb 2016. If this extension does not pass, they would have to leave US with an actual valid stay permission. It is simply not justifiable to grant permission and then deny it. It has everything to do with the credibility of this country.
