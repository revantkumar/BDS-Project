Anonymous I think some people are confused between F1 students working in US and US jobs getting transferred to other countries. The former is not only beneficial to students who after spending a lot of money get an education from a US university and then get some practical experience and an opportunity to demonstrate their skill, but those students also directly contribute to the US economy, be it in the form of taxes or like many who go on to become entrepreneurs and job creators.
