I approve to OPT.

Tuition fees can be measured, while knowledge not. 
Since some major are full of F-1 student, like data science( this is my major, only 3 of 33 are American citizens) or computer science, which American citizen not willing to learn, it's terrible for American that this kind of knowledge finally all pour into the brain of people who do not make any contribution back. When there is no OPT, there will be a huge vacant on some important step of the chain of economy to the whole American.

When reading some some comments object to OPT, I feel that they are relive their feelings to F-1 students, put their own failure, causing by their own indolence, to OPT. 

Some comments , citing some numbers to prove OPT is bad but don't talk about those data's origin and assumptions, do not make sense. F-1 student from STEM basically do not compete with citizens applying for the job in same kind. It's the job enviornment itself changed, you can not blame to OPT!

And look at the comments say we can not give "freebies" to foreign, that's interesting because workers with English the second language always gain underestimated wage. So in the end who give who "freebies"?

All the F-1 student in STEM wish to make American better, it's a win-win relationship. 

To say some thing true, when I look at some comments written by who object to OPT, their thinking remind me of old China in Qing Dynasty 100 years ago, you know what happened to China that time, terrible!
