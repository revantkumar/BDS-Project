I totally support the rule of OPT extension. I been working in the Electrical Engineering field for around 10 years and I understand that this field is not a regular filed. New graduates need more time for expanding training. This is a fast developing field, the students need more time to adapt themselves to the industry. With the expanding, new graduates will have enough time to learn more about the industry which may highly improve the benefits brought by education. Also, this gives more chances for the company to get the best works for them since there is longer time for them to observe a employees.
