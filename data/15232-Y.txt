Sen Yao I strongly support the OPT extension. 
I don't think the extension will hinder the Americans from finding jobs, but will help them instead. For one thing, the job market that qualify for the extension is far from saturating and requires specific higher degree and skills. In many programs/universities, a great portion of the students are international students. If they don't get extensions of staying longer for their job, It will be harder for those companies to find employees in the future, and eventually the companies will have to outsource their jobs, which in turn will harm the economy at the end. For another thing, the extension is one of the main things that attract international students to come to U.S. to study (in comparison to most Europe schools). And the more people coming the more consumption they will make, and that is good for the economy and will help the general Americans finding a job.
Also, America is a symbol of diversity and accepting different cultures. If all the illegal immigrants can stay and got accepted, it is only fair for those well-trained hard-working legal international students to have a extended period to work for their future and fortune in America.
