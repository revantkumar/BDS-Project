I strongly support this rule. If it would be approved, this is a great opportunity to attract more talents from world wide to study in America, and then make contributions to America. America needs more engineers to build and optimize their industry since there is lacking of engineers for a large number of American companies, especially in recent years. The approval of it can allow American companies hire more persons with strong abilities and push American economy forward.
