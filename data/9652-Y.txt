I do support the extension of OPT. It's a mutual benefit to both US citizens and foreign students. As STEM students, finding a job is important to apply the skills they learnt from classes and improve the lifes of the States and economy maybe. However, getting a working visa is very competitve and usually takes longer time. Thus, the extension is very important.
