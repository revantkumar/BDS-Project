I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Two points I want to mention to support my view

1. Foreign students have made significant contributions to the United States economy. a. Public colleges and universities such as University of California System, particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students. b. international students have brought long-term prosperities to local business including but not limited to local house or apartment rental, car dealer and restaurants. c. At the same time, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills to United States high tech company. Without new OPT extension rule. Universities and colleges in U.S will definitely be less attractive to international student than those in other countries such as Canada, Uk and China. 

2. Foreign students participating in practical training in STEM fields should be encouraged to pursue meaningful projects that contribute to a deeper understanding of their field of study and help develop the practical skills necessary to advance their careers. Based on my research and work experience at UC Irvine and current company respectively, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT period only last 12 months, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.
