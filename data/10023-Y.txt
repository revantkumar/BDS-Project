Sat Gam This rule will only lead to recruit low cost foreigners at the expense of Americans. STEM OPT is nicer way to circumvent Americans first in job market.Most of the stem OPT will not work in the field they are trained/educated for, but instead put in some fake experience and join some cosultancy company thereby ruining a genuine opportunity which would otherwise goes to an American citizen. Please do not pass this rule at any cost
