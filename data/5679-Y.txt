Stephen Cooper The OPT program has caused enough damage to America through loss of taxes and loss of jobs for American students. I have seen the results of this program in the past and can believe nothing else but that an expansion of this program could only cause more damage. Perhaps there is another young mind capable of finding the cure for cancer, or finding the next source of power, sitting idly by because he/she can't afford to go to college or can't find a job in the STEM market because our government has decided that foreign students are more important than Americans. A goodly number of these F-1 workers seem to never return to their home countries to help out there, but find other loopholes to stay and ride the system in America. Statistics have proven the amount of job loss, tax loss and further loss by unemployment payouts is staggering.

Sincerely,
Stephen Cooper
