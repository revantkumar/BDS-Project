MinMeng Xu OPT extension is good for both US and international students.
For US:
1.It increases the competence of those high tech companies in the US as international STEM students are a large portion in high tech companies.It's not because these students take American's job,it's because lots of American are not interested in high tech.I said so because there are only one or two Americans in my graduate class while there'are 50 international students.These talent and hardworking students are the reason why US being the leader in high tech industries.
2.These students actually increase lots job for Americans.When they're living in America,they need house/apartment rental,cars,goods,entertainment.And that means it will boost the local economy.Also,these students won't have a job like cashier,waiter,etc and they can only have STEM related jobs so they are not going to take American's job.
For students:
1.Longer OPT times means they can make more money.They pay lots of money and effort to study in America.
2.Not every international students wants to stay in America.Some of them just wanna work for a few years and go back to his/her country.Longer OPT times allows they to get more experience and have more competence when they go back.
