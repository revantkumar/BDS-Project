United State is regard as a dream country for more than hundred years, since it stands for a spirit of freedom and always open a righteousness door for the world people, and the spirit of America inspired by all us. There always exist mutual benefit for each side, the country and those visiting people.

The international students plays an extraordinary important role among them. First of all, more and more ambitious students would come to US to learn cutting edge knowledge, try to implement their knowledge and make a contribution to this territory during this extended period. Secondly, when they study here, there is also a benefit for educational and real estate industry. Each student would pay not only the tuition fee, but also the rent fee. From year 2012 to 2013, 819644 Chinese students come to US to study, and this trend is always ascending. If this proposal aborted, they may have more consideration to go to other country, and this country would lose this big profit.

Thirdly, I have reviewed other negative review, many of them just worried about lose their job when competing with other international students. Actually the competence always there, everywhere!! If there is no other international students, yeah, indeed, they could increase their probability to get jobs. But is this good for those company? The recruiter may not successfully employed the good candidate, especially in STEM area. Under this circumstance, most of this corporate could not stand on the cutting edge in the world. What was worse, some of citizen in US, may not study hard to compete their careers, which is definitely not good for future for this country.

I always believe this extension policy is good for US.
