To Whom It may Concern,

I strongly support this proposal for several reasons.

First, improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 Students are very important for interest of United States. America has been ranking Top 1 country all over the world, due to its excellent technology and complete systems. Improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees will help American companies and agencies to create more fabulous products and made more contributions to American Society.

Second, some people are against this proposal for they think it's not fair for American Students. The new proposal has provided a very strict protective system to protect American students' interest, for employers won't be able to take advantage of this proposal to damage American students, like hiring international students with lower salaries. Again, this proposal definitely confirm American students have the same, actually more, rights to find a job compared with international students.

Third, it is obvious that American economy has recovered from economic crisis, and it has great demands for students, especially with STEM degrees. So improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees will definitely improve American economy.
