Xiao Zhang I strongly support expanding the OPT for F-1 students. I need to speak loud for international students.

For all these comments saying international students stealing their jobs, it is simply not the truth. 

Truth is that priority has always been and already given to the citizens. 

As a materials science international student, the truth is that most of the companies don't even consider international students. We can only apply for limited number companies and compete with everyone else. For the companies which do consider internationals, they will also first consider citizens if there are any citizen candidates.

Truth is that companies will only consider internationals when there are no qualified citizens. If one citizen and one international applies for the same position with same level of expertise, the citizen will get the job just because it is much easier for a company considering restrictions, documents stuff.

So internationals are given very limited opportunities and we are not stealing jobs. If we get the job, that means there is either no qualified citizens applying, or we are simply awesome enough to compete everyone else.

U.S. is a country for equal opportunity, can't believe there is people who can say words like "send them back". 

U.S. needs brilliant people from all over the world, and U.S. has always been doing good things to keep brilliant people stay in the U.S. and contribute to the growth of U.S economy, technologies. Please continue doing the right thing.
