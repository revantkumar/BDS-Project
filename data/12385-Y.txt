Instead of looking to foreign workers (even legal here on visas), we should be looking to "improve and expand training opportunities" for our students here in our education system. It's shameful that schools here are drowning because of a lack of funding, and Congress is spending millions developing rules and laws to pass or not pass that are not designed to help OUR workforce AT ALL. 

For shame. Really.
