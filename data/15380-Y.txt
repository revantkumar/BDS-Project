I have taught English as a Second or other Language in Boise, Idaho for many years; first at Boise State, and currently at the 
International Rescue Committee where we also teach Civics, American History, and Citizenship classes. I am a volunteer teacher, as are the other teachers. In addition to the history and civics instruction, we also teach the students how to read, write, and speak the English language. 

The goal of the students is to become.American citizens. They are all very motivated, and they attend each and every class we offer, practicing and improving their skills in class, and doing the homework the assignments that they are given.

In all my years of teaching, I have met and taught wonderful students. They are very appreciatve and grateful for all that we offer in the classes. 

Although due to limited funding to our program, we can only offer the classes two days a week, two hours each class, for a total of only four hours a week. 

As a part of the classes, we do "mock" citizenship interviews, and have guest speakers to help the students learn about the customs and culture of the United States.

Many of our students have passed the Citizenship test when they have gone to the Immigration and Naturalization Services and have been successful in other areas of their lives becaus they learned the English language, The other students are still trying hard to learn how to become American citizens. Some of the students who have become citizens,visit our class to talk about their interview at the Immigration Officje, and to show by their own experience that it is possible for other students to do the same.
