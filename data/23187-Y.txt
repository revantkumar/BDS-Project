I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons,
1, 1 year is too short for most of STEM program in most of the tech companies. For example, projects in IT companies usually requires continuous and long enough exposure to the code base. Once a employee with such experience has to leave, the company has to waste another year to train a new employee from scratch again.
2, International students play an important role in the STEM of many universities

Graduate Electrical Engineering Programs have more than 90 percent international enrollment!!!
Once these international students have to leave, the Silicon Valley will have a hard time to hire enough qualified employees.
3, International students will bring up the local economy. In my university, Syracuse University, no matter which restaurant you go into, you will see a bunch of Asian faces. And recently the home owner of the house where I live has earned a lot from his properties rent to my Chinese classmates.
