Some people said foreign STEM students will take away US citizen's job. I totally disagree with this! Foreign STEM students will keep US as one of the most innovative country in the world. This will produce more jobs for US citizens. A lot of companies, such as Google and Microsoft, need many STEM students. If we cannot keep all these foreign STEM students in US to work for us, this will be a big loss to our country!! So I totally support this rule.
