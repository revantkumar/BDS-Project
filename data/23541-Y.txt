I strongly support OPT extension rule. There is a common 
misunderstanding in some negative comments, that is the citizens are unable to find a job because of these international STEM students. Actually, many international students and workers create lots of companies which indeed bring lots of employment opportunities, not to mention the very positive contribution to economy of US. 
Some people here, however, hope America to reject a huge number of well-educated and creative talents. In fact, it would lose American's leading role in economy and technology if some people always have this misunderstanding.
