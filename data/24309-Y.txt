This OPT extension is good for US in the following aspects.

The University in the US can attract a lot of talented students for a large reason because of its OPT policy better than other counties, like UK, Australia, etc. 

Besides the talented students, they pay a lot of tuition (a huge amount... really really huge amount..!!)
IF USA cut the OPT extension, the further students may very likely choose other countries, and pay the tuition and living fees to other countries instead of US. You should know how much financial benefit that international students bring to The US. 

Also, the OPT will help the international students equipped with good working experience at international background, which will help then better prepared when they back to their home counties. 

To sum up, OPT extension is good for the US and international students, and thus should be supported !
