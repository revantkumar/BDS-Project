I would like to submit my comments in response to this proposed ruleI strongly support to approving this rule on Oct 19, 2015.

First, I have read an article before, the title is "The Economic Benefit of International Students",it shows that International students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to NAFSAs economic analysis.

Second, U.S. is an immigrant country. Besides, the government is NOT spending taxes on OPT and H1b workers. Instead, OPT and H1b workers are paying taxes without any getting much benefits, this is good for social security system of United States.

With this comment, I urge you support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule. Thank you for your consideration and time.
