I strongly support the rule to the STEM OPT extension for following reasons:

1.Equality and Freedom is the founding spirit of the United States. Especially STEM students, these talent people deserve more time to practice their skill and contribute U.S. for a longer time.
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."---<The Declaration of Independence>

2.The culture of immigration has contribute the United States for centuries. From Mayflower to post World War II. Immigration has made this land become the most wonderful place in the world. So why not introduce more to make is land better.

3.Instead of taking jobs from Americans, STEM students is deserved to receive those offers because they are better they others. This fact will encourage the local students to become better. The reason Americans afraid of STEM students taking jobs is they are not confident that they deserve the job better than others.

I hope the Homeland Security Department and the U.S. will make the right decision that contribute to this country.
