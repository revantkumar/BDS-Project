I wholly SUPPORT the proposal.

I don't understand why so many American came out to oppose this win-win policy that has already performed for long time and also it really did and is doing for America economy in some sense.

If I am a STEM students, how can I stay in America without OPT extention program? If I can't stay in US, how can I contribute my skill and technique to this beautiful and tolerant country?

Please release OPT extention of STEM, it will be win-win.
