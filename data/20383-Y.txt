I definitely support this OPT extension. 

As an international student, we spend a lot of money in the study at America, which is many years' salaries from our parents. It's much more expensive than the local student's pay. And you could imagine that our tuition saves how much money for the residence students in the school. We definitely have the rights to practice our skills in real industry, which is also part of the experience in the study aboard. 

You could imagine that if there is no OPT extension, a large amount of foreign students would never want to come to study in the US, especially because that their money no longer worth it. With fewer and fewer investigation from the foreign students, the benefits which the local students could have would also decrease. I think this is also pretty bad for the development of many science area gets slower. 

If the US want to keep a high speed development in high technique areas, attracting more and more intelligent students to here would definitely be necessary. More benefits!
