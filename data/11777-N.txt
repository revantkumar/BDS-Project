This program is a complete fiasco. A foreign student here in a STEM curriculum should not be provided ANY US federal, state, or local government assistance whatsoever. We have thousands of fully capable US CITIZEN and legal immigrant (green card) students that would appreciate the same assistance but because a potential employer of the foreign student would not have to pay their portion of payroll taxes (social security, etc.) the American student is at a major disadvantage in finding employment. This is totally unacceptable. The liberal union and government interference that has totally wrecked our K-12 education system in this country now proposes to double down on their ineptitude by importing foreign students to cover any perceived lack of adequately prepared college candidates. Foreign students should be limited to a small percentage of student enrollment in any college or university receiving any form of government assistance, whether direct or indirect via government backed or generated student loans or grants. Further, no foreign student should be allowed to receive compensation by any employer unless they agree to pay the full payroll taxes - including that portion usually paid by the employer. A special social security account number could be assigned to all students in this program so that funds received into that account could be directly applied to the US debt without any benefit to the non citizen student. This would give the AMERICAN citizen student an employment advantage, which is as it should be in an AMERICAN institution. Further, instead of costing tax dollars, it would help in reducing our historic debt.
