STEM OPT extension is very important to USA and we cannot afford to let it drop. According to (http://www.computerworld.com/article/2503903/it-skills-training/obama-expands-opt-visa-program-for-foreign-students.html), USCIS approved about 35,000 OPT extension. I can only see this number increase because of the booming of foreign students seeking US education. And also, if we consider cumulative numbers over the next few years, the bill will affect millions of students. If we drop the bill, here is what's gonna happen:

Effect:
- Foreign students majoring in STEM will stop coming to USA if they cannot see any future after they graduate. Instead they will switch to UK, Canada, German for higher education and advanced degree in STEM, which can be much easier to even get green cards. 

Results:
- So the income of the universities will get affected, which may further hurt the funding of the research conducted at those universities. Some of the research heavily rely on the income of the universities and those research projects will have to cut back expense.

- Our tech sector will get some serious damage because of the shortage of skilled engineers. I can tell you: a large portion of top-notch engineering and science students are foreign students. Those global tech companies may still be able to hire good engineers and scientists from other counties if they have offices and branches in other counties. But those small startups or local tech companies that cannot afford to hire in other counties will have a great shortage of human power.

- Foreign students generate a lot of dynamics to our economy. In most cases, their funding comes from their parents and their spending in USA is essentially a direct investment to increase the demand. On average, a student will spend $20,000 per year (http://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-us) on a four-year public college. If the bill affects 1 million students, we are talking about 20 bill
