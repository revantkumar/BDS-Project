Ann Naylor There are countless numbers of qualified graduates in our nation to fill employment needs. Allowing companies to import foreign workers, at less cost to the company, is a totally unfair advantage to them. Our children must borrow money to attend our universities and upon graduation are required to begin making payments on those loans. They find less and less opportunities for employment and this proposal will only make the situation worse. Please do not pass this bill.
