I would strongly support this new rule. This would benefit the U.S local people, the local economy, the education system.
The number of international students who come to USA to study is growing these years. One of the most important reasons is that they believe U.S will provide them some short time working experience after their graduation. However, if the OPT stem program is not going on in the future, more of the international students would like to choose other developed countries. Because most of European countries do not allow the trade of guns. And since their children can not gain some working experience from U.S. Why they will rescue their children's lives for the sake of getting nothing? A very large group of internaional students would go to England or Germany to study since they also have very good education system. Then, the number of international students coming in US will go down, which will lead to a large drop down to the tuition that universities get. The facilities, the professors will not get sufficient fund to support their research, which in the long term will not be good to the society.
We know that knowledge and education is the base of a Country. Therefore, for the sake of US, we would like support the extension of the rule. Thanks.
