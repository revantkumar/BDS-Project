About me:
I am data scientist in the silicon valley right now, and I was a student from University of Texas at Austin at the MS in business analytics program between 2013 and 2014. One of the reasons I chose the program, or I chose to come to America to study is that the program IS A STEM program, which will allows me, if not getting H1B visa, to work at most 29 months in the USA, which inspires me a lot as this is such a great opportunity to learn and contribute my knowledge into the industry. I cannot image how I would do without this extension and how would impact my decision back at then, but it is REALLY REALLY important to make US a family of people all around the world in the classroom and in the industry. Without it US will definitely lose tons of great individuals that can contribute. 

I HIGHLY SUPPORT THE CHANGE FROM 17 MONTHS TO 24 MONTHS.
