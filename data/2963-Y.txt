I'm a Chinese undergraduate who is planning to go to the United States for further study. I believe it's short-sighted and against the interests of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation. On the contrary, this regulation would better contribute to the success of United States, and bring benefits to American economy and employment.
We all know that Information Technology consists of 10 percent of America's GDP. However, high-tech companies like Google and Microsoft are short of well-trained students to further develop their products. International students aren't in competition with American citizens ---- there are so limited American citizens studying STEM related majors, but the high-tech companies need much more people than the number of this group, and that's why they are willing to give high salaries to international students ---- they are qualified engineers which would contribute to the growth of the company. Suppose this regulation can't get passed, potential applicants would be discouraged, and as a result, the States would lose many elite students from top universities, which would greatly affect the economy.
I truly understand citizens who oppose this regulation. But I think the States should put much more emphasis on illegal immigrants and companies that are abusing the OPT and H1B. They are really disturbing the market and stealing American people's jobs.
American itself is a country with immigrants, from example, Satya Nadella is from India, Sergey Brin was born in Russia. Albert Einstein came from Germany. The boom, power and success of America have much to do with excellent STEM students.
In conclusion, as a great country who are always open to talents, so the States should continue to open its arm to people with ability.
