First of all, the claim that "save the job for Americans" is totally nonsense. "Nonimmigrant Students" stand for foreigners who have already studies in the U.S. for at least college, therefore they received similar or even better education to those who oppose this policy. In this term, it is not sure, but possible that those F-1 students are able to contribute more to the U.S. as a whole - compare to those who want to "secure" their jobs by exploiting others.
Secondly, I'm laughing at those who consider kids here as "smart and creative". No doubt that the U.S. education is the best all over the world, but is the local student always the best? No! Under these people's overconfidence of their kids, I cannot image how would those kids be taught in the future. It's possible that they neglect the strength of the foreigners and never improve themselves anymore. I encourage this act because of that: provide more competitive situation for U.S. kids.
Lastly, this act is a huge step of the Obama Government toward equality and freedom for sure. Once it's passed, immigrants, one of the weakest minority in the U.S., will be able to donate more of their works to the U.S. Then, my dear WATW members, who I consider as selfish and lazy, why not?
