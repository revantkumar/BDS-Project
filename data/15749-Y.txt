I strongly support the OPT extension. As an international student, I also got offers from other top universities in other countries such as Britain and Japan. Yet I chose the US in the end largely because the oversea working experience is very cherished in my home country (China). With OPT (and its extension), I could work in the US for two years and would get better job when I get back to China. It would be very disappointing if the federal decides to cancel the extension - it would affect a ton of other international students' decisions (like mine) when choosing school.
