Wendy Dong I strongly support this proposal. I believe that non-immigrant students had been contributed a fair amount of workforce, especially in the STEM fields, during their OPT period in the US. It also had made possible the successful transition of F1 to H1B for many graduates with higher degrees and thus ensured the maintenance of workforce in STEM industry. If the STEM OPT would not have existed for these years, the United States would have lost a huge portion of labor that is capable of benefiting both the economy and technology in this country. This proposal provides a reasonable procedure for STEM students to maximize their legal working permission after graduation up to three years. Both the industry and the students will benefit even more from this plan.
