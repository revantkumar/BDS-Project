The book keeping of mentoring for post completion OPT is not practical and just increases the burden on school and employers and just becomes a paperwork.

Don't propose a rule that cannot be checked. I think the focus should be on issuing green cards after an initial 2 years on post completion OPT.

This will address only a tiny subset of international students plight.Not really anything ground breaking here.
