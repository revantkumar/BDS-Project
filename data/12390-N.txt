In view of the shocking 1938 ratio of work participation of Americans in our job market today, it is inconceivable that it is in America's interest to prefer and accommodate foreign nationals to work in STEM jobs, by increasing their 1 year on-the-job training experience to 36 months and making them more employable to employers seeking to cut prevailing wages and avoidance of employers' contributions. This expanded number of employed foreigners would cost Social Security alone over $1 billion a year. Americans, especially those just starting out with college loans to pay back, would lose or be denied hundreds of thousands of jobs. 

Such a change would alter the intent and function of the OPT training program by creating a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. This "improvement" is but another form of corporate welfare and crony capitalism, in detriment to the rights of American workers. 

It would be more appropriate for DHA to improve and expand employment training and placement for Americans holding degrees in the STEM fields, as these Americans will be more likely to care about America and her safety, contribute positively to the economy for a lifetime, and in the rearing and education of the next generation of American taxpayers, leaders, warriors, All of these factors would ensure a secure homeland. 

Last, this proposed rule is not rule-making but legislating concerning immigration, and as such, it is beyond the scope of rule or order not supported by the Congress. It is unlawful.
