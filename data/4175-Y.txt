From F-1 STEM students' perspective, lots of them are willing to work several years in USA after graduation. It's obvious, but there does exist one point to be highlighted: a large number of these students prefer to working in USA for more experience, not immigration. Just as the very name suggests, this is expanding training opportunitiies for us.
From a US citizen's perspective, diversification makes America the greatest country in the world. Because the best STEM students from all different countries study and work in America, we help each US citizen make your country a better one. A booming market creates more job positions and provides a better life tomorrow. And we STEM students are trying to help.All we need is an opportunity.
Thank you for your consideration!
