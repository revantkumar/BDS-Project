I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 

Firstly, this is great opportunity to help boost the economy of the U.S. Each year, international contribute a huge amount of tuition. They rent house which is also a great way to help local American get some extra money. If the U.S. do not have OPT extension, international students would choose other countries to pursue their degree, get training opportunities and help other countries increase economy and develop technology. 

Secondly, if the rule is cancelled right now, the technology companies would also suffered a catastrophe. Companies would suddenly lost many workers which would affect their own operation. They need lots of time to recruit new employees and train them, which both need time and money. So this new OPT extension rule is a great way to help technology companies keep their pace, develop their technology and gain more money from the new products. 

Above all, this is a win-win rule. International students get a chance to work for the U.S. and the U.S. can gain money and professional developments from this new OPT extension rule.
