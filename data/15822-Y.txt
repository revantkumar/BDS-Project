USA NEED high-skilled STEM students to improve its economy. 

USNEWS reported that ' U.S. economy could use more workers with high levels of knowledge in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.' The foreigner students do not compete with US citizens for the jobs. For examples, there are some 40,000 computer science bachelor's degree earners each year but roughly 4 million job vacancies for computer workers.

Don't buy claims that the U.S. has too many STEM workers.
