Jack McCormick I am opposed to expanding this program because, although I am retired (age 73) I have grandsons who will soon be in the job market and will be negatively affected in finding STEM related jobs because of the unfair completion of noncitizen workers that are permitted by expanding this program. Thank you very much for considering my comment.
