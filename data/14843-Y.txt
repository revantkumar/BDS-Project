I strongly support this proposal.

1. As a STEM student, I think practical training is an important and necessary part of STEM education.

2. I think this part of well-educated and trained students will bring benefits to the industries.

3. I don't think it will impact others' job opportunities since to hire an international student the company must pay more and go through complicated processes.
