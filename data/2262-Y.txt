I support STEM extension. There is a very small section of students that would benefit from this rule but the impact it would have in improving the US economy will be massive. The students already on OPT have invested considerable amount of $ to get the degree and are now working with employers and adding value to their respective organizations. These students continue to rent apartments, buy cars and other items thereby keeping the economy running. Not allowing such students to continue and prosper will in fact hurt the US economy even more because if these students have to leave US all of a sudden then who would pay for all the loans that are currently in repayment and it might lead to another slowdown which would then affect everyone invovlved be it students, immigrants or US citizens.
