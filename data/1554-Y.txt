Thank you for receiving the comment. I fully support the new rule which improves the status quo of students and provides them an opportunity to work in their respective fields. I strongly believe that 24 months of extension would help students acquire more work experience besides contributing to US economy in terms of paying taxes and indirectly helping the economy by spending. 
I have graduated from UT system and currently working for a reputed company. My OPT will expire in 2016 and new rule will help me in getting it extended so that I would be able to contribute to the services of my company. It is very stressful to think about not being allowed to work in case I would not get a H1B and the current stem extension gets cancelled. It also puts my employer at risk of being invested so much in my abilities only to be left with helpless situation and without substantial return on investment.
By extending it to 24 months, it benefits both companies and students alike. It gives the students the opportunity to acquire more knowledge and become a substantial contributors to US economy. Indirectly it helps in attracting the best talent from across the globe and if the OPT stem extension is cancelled, it could severely impact the talent pool that US has been successfully able to attract. 
I strongly believe that it is a win-win situation to have the stem opt extension extended to 24 months and reinstates the belief that US is still the number one destination for Mathematics, Science and Engineering.

Thank you for your time.
