The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.
Why should Obama be allowed to expand the time. These jobs should go to American workers who are loosing their jobs in such places as Disney. Time to say no. Take care of Americans first.
