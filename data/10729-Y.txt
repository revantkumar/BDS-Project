I believe OPT extension is important for both America and international students.

1 If without culture diversity, how can America be so great?

2 OPT extension is basic human right for international students. They should have a opportunity to explore their interest and apply what they learn at university to work.

3 cancel OPT extension will cause American recession. Now there are about 200 thousand international students apply OPT extension. How can American top companies face the brain drain?
