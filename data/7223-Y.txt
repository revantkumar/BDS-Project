Ryan Bradley I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. Also, under F1 OPT STEM increase the extension to 24 months because we need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S.
