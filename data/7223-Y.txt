I support this proposal. 
It is just so sad to see a great number of these commenters are so biased and have no regards to people who travel thousands of miles and study in this country. Some of them say that they hate the fact that foreigners just turn the workplace into a third world. Maybe their point is never about keeping the jobs for Americans, it is just racial discrimination.
