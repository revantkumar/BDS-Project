I totally support the new rule. Most of the universities in USA are having students across the globe. Being internationals we are coming to USA to gain good quality of education and also to gain some experience in the respective fields. Also many internationals are working in diverse fields from years. Both the groups (Students and Employees) are good contributors to the USA economy.
I am from India and I am in Clinical Research program at Medical University of South Carolina(MUSC). After completion of my education from this prestigious institute I am looking for a job at MUSC so that I can get ample amount of experience and also it will help me to clear my bank loan.
