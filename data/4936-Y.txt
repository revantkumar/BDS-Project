As a Stem major new graduate from US universities, I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let students who has a degree from U.S. universities in this country and let them keep making contributions to US because US higher education is the best in the world, and graduate students from US colleges are usually of higher quality than other countries.
2. Diversity is very important for U.S., tens of millions foreign scientists, professionals come to US and made their contributions to the country,
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many international students didn't lower their salary to compete with US citizens, they mainly compete for positions that need special skills that US doesn't have. Competitions can help U.S. select better talents and improve the country's competency. Whether it's international or domestic student, they both can contribute to U.S.'s global competence.
