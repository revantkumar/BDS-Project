I sincerely support the proposed rule by DHS. 

As suggested in "Discussion of Elements of the STEM OPT Extension", this is a wise step in addressing a critical need for qualified, highly-trained and well-educated STEM workers for the healthy growth of the U.S. economy.

After reading some comments that oppose this rule, I find their main excuse is that foreign STEM students would take jobs from those unemployed citizens. The truth is there is a serious shortage in the job market for STEM workers, and that those unemployed citizens cannot help eliminate this shortage. Cited from an article in 2012 by Bureau of Labor Statistics, "Economic projections point to a need for approximately 1 million more STEM professionals than the U.S. will produce at the current rate over the next decade if the country is to retain its historical preeminence in science and technology."

We can also see that DHS is wise in ruling out those foreign STEM students that are not qualified to satisfy the need of economy. The rule says that the unemployment time for foreign STEM students is limited (90 days for initial OPT and 60 days for extended OPT), and that students must be working in the field of STEM to be eligible for OPT extension.

In conclusion, the rule guarantees that the foreign students only contribute to the STEM field where there is a critical labor shortage. I sincerely believe DHS is proposing a wise rule, and that we should stick to this rule if there is no better rules proposed.
