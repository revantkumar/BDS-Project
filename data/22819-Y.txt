I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

The government should let the highly educated students make contributions to the country after graduation.

The competition from international students are not bad at all. The competition is helping the employers find the best candidates for the job and bring new culture background and new ideas to U.S. companies. And the positions can be fulfilled by international students do need special skills that American people don't usually have. So offering a job opportunity doesn't take a job from an American person.
