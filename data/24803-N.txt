The U. S. has no obligation to take anyone in or allow any LEGAL immigartion. We can not take in every person on the planet. We have more than enough people in this country already. The government has an obligation to preserve our country and the jobs available for our citizens. Stop ALL imigration! Furthermore, seal the borders and DEPORT all ILLEGAL ALIENS! You have an obligation to do so.
