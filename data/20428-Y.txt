As a country with an exclusive history of utilizing immigrant workers, I am all for immigrants learning, staying and producing. The current regulatory changes apply to non-immigrant graduates that seek to gain experience in the U.S. tech workforce. If those who make this decision called for in ICEB-2015-0002-0011 are in possession of evidence that extending this rule will truly support the well being and strength of the United States then I will leave it to them.
My concern is that, despite the provisions stated in sections G, H and I, the overstaffing of STEM workers will continue to drive American citizens out of jobs that will almost surely be staffed by STEM workers. And extending the time they are allowed to stay in such a capacity only prolongs the pain of tech workers like myself.

In summary, I was born in the U.S.A. and graduated from an American university in 2011 with a technical degree after years of student loans and working part-time. Since then I have been able to get some work in the tech field. But as I look around at the majority of workers in a 350 person facility, I see that over 75% of the workers are Indian or Chinese. They do prove to be very proficient at what they do. But they are still there, and I am not. I am quite capable of providing value and excellence in my chosen field, but as long as this unequal distribution of foreign born tech workers persists, I might as well go back to school and try a different career.
