Grady Peterson I do think passing this bill would be a benifit to our country. In cases where a student can go back to there home country and use their skills to improve their country it would benefit others from their home country and give others a reason to not have to migrate. I know this is not an option in many countries so the best would be for the person to stay in the U.S.
