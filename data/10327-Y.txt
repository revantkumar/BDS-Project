I strongly support this rule. STEM International graduate students are very talented, hardworking and skillful. This stem OPT 24 months period will give them some time to gain practical experience working in the US organizations. The STEM international graduates definitely deserve this since they will help improve US economy during their STEM OPT 24 months period.
