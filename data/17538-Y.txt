I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am a Electrical Engineering student who came from China. At the point of time I considered further study, I was an undergraduate student in Singapore. I might as well continue my study there, or went to other countries, but I finally chose to come here, not only for the fact the university is famous for its strong academic background, but also for the practical experience that I will be able to obtained during the OPT period. In fact, many of my peer students from China also considered the OPT as a good chance for gaining practical experience when they decided to come here. I think prolonged the duration will make U.S. academic sector an even more attractive choice than before!
