In general the employer requires to fill a lot of paper work and pay a lot of money to hire international student, so most of the employer do NOT want to hire international student, and we all know Under current job market, how hard is to find a job even for American. So the ones do get hired usually are the best at what they do, and what they know is in need. To let them stay only help the economy and creat more job. Why do we want to send those people back to their contoury to fight against us?
