Ernest Wade Many foreign students are given advantages not available to most American students. Most universities have allocated large numbers of seats and scholarships specifically for foreign students thus denying Americans these same advantages. Universities often reserve jobs on campus specifically for foreign students, those jobs being denied to American students. Some universities, like The University of Georgia, reserve large blocks of on-campus housing thus denying this housing to American students. Many corporations provide scholarships specifically for foreigh students. (Soros Foundation).

Foreign students are often accorded in-state tuition whereas American military veterans are often forced to pay out-of-state tuition.

The proposed rule change will give advantages to foreign students that are denied to Americans. The people supporting this rule change are really after flooding the United States with STEM Degrees so that they can cut the cost of doing business. This rule change is unfair to American students and shold be denied. Approval of this rule change will deny many American students a STEM Degree.
