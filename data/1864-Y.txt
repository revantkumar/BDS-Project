liansheng zheng I fully support to extend the OPT extension to be 24 Months for STEM students.
First, I am a STEM student graduated last year. I benefitted from the OPT extension. I can work in US now because I have OPT extension and time to apply for H1B visa.
Second, 24 Months OPT extension duration is better for those who didn't get H1B visa lottery, like me, to get a second chance to apply.
Third, we international students study, work, and live in US, we will fight for what we deserve.

Thanks
