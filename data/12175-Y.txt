I am addressing the issue of bringing an absolute halt to the outragous form of jobs sustainment. We have ample employees available to fill the jobs market. Would YOU as a parent be totally alright for foreign students to come across our openly welcome borders to undermine our current struggling economy? Big business certainly would. That to me is corruption in its purest form! Now that our illustrious President sees fit to undermine our prospective chances for our AMERICAN graduates to advance to the already sluggish job market. Its only proper to abolish the falsely created bill in D.C. to not allow this bill to be-come law. Hypocrites running this once great country need to wake up for once and realize our voice in the Legislature must be heard and recognized. Thank you in advance for your utmost consideration.
