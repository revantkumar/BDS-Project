My husband is but one example of an American born citizens with a bachelor's degree and years of management experience that is still laid off (since 2007). He tries to make ends meet as a mobile notary but has given up on this country and has no hopes of ever being fully employed again. My youngest daughter, also underemployed, worked three jobs to pay off her student loans, while my eldest daughter is still paying them off but not working in the filed her degree is in.

I think it's very difficult for those with power and money to understand what the middle and upper-middle class lives are like these days. I dont think they realize that we all are expecting a lay-off of some type, eventually, due to this wonderful global economy, first initiated by NAFTA and Bill Clinton. I have never seen such depressing, uncertain times as I do today and cannot believe Obama's administration is boosting about economic recovery. I fear there is more uncertainty lurking in many corners. I try to stay up to date on many issues but find it very depressing. Not only are we over populated as a world, we are over populated as a country as well. Return the illegals to their country of origin and reduce or remove the green cards and visas granted to so many foreigners, then we can retrain our own citizens as it should have been to begin with. Stop giving all of our information to 3rd world countries! I still cannot believe this has happened...how ignorant to think giving out all of our information wouldn't bite us in the end.
