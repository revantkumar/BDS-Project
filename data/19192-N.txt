The government of this country has got to stop allowing people from outside it's borders from coming here and taking jobs that American workers can fill. We have a population that wants to work, college graduates that can't find jobs, and too many folks that have just given up. If the governing body of this country do not do what's best for our citizens then you need to be replaced. End the invasion of foreign workers now. It is your responsibility to the people of the United States to protect its interests, not allow citizens of other countries the opportunities to take ours. They can stay home and fix their own screwed up messes.
