The Obama administration is the most corrupt administration in American history. It therefore cannot be entrusted with the responsibility of this proposed rule.

How OUTRAGEOUS that we have 50 MILLION UNEMPLOYED AMERICAN CITIZENS, but Obama and Mark Zuckerberg and others of their socialist ilk prefer cheap labor to national sovereignty and the rule of law.

NO, NO, NO TO YOUR PROPOSAL.

I look forward to the day when a new CONSERVATIVE president not given to the incompetence and anti-American rhetoric of Obama will WIPE OUT EVERY ONE OF HIS EXECUTIVE ORDERS ON HIS OR HER FIRST DAY OF OFFICE.
