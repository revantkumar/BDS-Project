Richard Mixon Please do not bring on even more of the "indentured servitude" that has been brought to this country by H1B and now would be furthered by OPT.

The proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program makes it that much harder for American STEM workers, especially recent college graduates, to find work at free market wages.

It seems the program allows U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been in the US pursuing a degree for a minimum of nine months (what kind of degree program lasts nine months?). This artificially inflates the number of available workers for jobs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields - keeping wages lower for all STEM workers.

This program also puts citizen workers at a disadvantage. If a US citizen is hired the employer must pay the employer share of payroll taxes. However if the OPT worker is hired, the employer does NOT have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes. Furthermore the OPT worker does not have to be paid a prevailing wage.

I have worked in the tech industry for over 40 years. I've worked alongside a large number of H1B workers, which the OPT program seems designed to complement. At first they are overjoyed at the "opportunity" this provides. The wages may be low compared to some of their US citizen counterparts, but they wages are much more than they would make back home ... and they are in "America." But after a few years everyone realizes that they are basically just a new form of "indentured servant" - they are owned by their employer. They cannot realistically move to a new job - and with OPT they will not be able to move at all it seems. This further turns businesses into just a new type of plantation.

I am not anti-business by any means, owning and working in small businesses for the last 25 years. However business does not need and should not be getting tax-payer funded welfare like OPT.
