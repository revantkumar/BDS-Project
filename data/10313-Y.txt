Being a founder and CEO of major tech firm, I am qualified to say that American stem workers require this rule as much as these students, if these students are not retained, then our economy gets affected in many ways. We are already in short of STEM workers, which is indirectly resulting in jobs getting exported to countries like India and China. There will be a time when we will have to search for jobs in those countries if we don't retain the talent necessary for continous growth and research in STEM field. Absence of this rule will lead to these students to look for education at places other than US, like Canada. It will directly affect cost of education as these foreign students are major contributors to our education system. Most public Universities are still standing because of these students. Yes I believe importance should be given to American worker first, but there are enough provisions in this rule which does the same.
