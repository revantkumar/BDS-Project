I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international applied mathematics major with actuarial concentration student from China and currently Im a business system analyst in a bank. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my bachelor degree such as US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents like me. Without this OPT extension rule, I do not believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. Furthermore, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech and data companies, such as Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

I think that 12 months regular plus 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at DePaul University, most large data mining/research development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.

As I'm a Chinese STEM student and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.
