Yanni Ge i couldn't be more supportive to this new policy. i have a few reasons:

1. For those who graduate from U.S. universities, they are talented with their skills and knowledge and most importantly, they want to make a contribution to U.S. companies and society, and therefore why should they be deprived of their rights to stay in U.S legally? U.S accepts them, as well as embrace their talent and their willing to make America a better country. 

2. If this new policy is not approved, they foreign students will have less opportunities to work in U.S., then there will be less people coming to U.S which will be a tremendous loss to US diversity and economy.
