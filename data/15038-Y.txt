I highly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

I am planning to study in USA and I am wondering why the government do not let STEM student stay in this country in order to make more contributions to US?

I believe there are too many famous people in America who came from Europe, Asia and so on, why they can stay in America due to the good policy of immigration for STEM student. I am eager to be a STEM student and stay in America.

America is consist of DIVERSITY, so how important it is for America.

I do believe Competition does exist all the way all the time. It is really not bad. At least, in a market economy, we need competition to select the superior and eliminate the inferior. Most of STEM students are all eager to learn knowledge in US and stay and work in US.

I don't think STEM is bring pressure to America citizen, instead it is helping America economy back to prosperity and boom again.
