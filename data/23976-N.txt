The OPT "program" that this administration is attempting to sneak in appears to be another swat at AMERICAN JOBS.

Why is this action needed, and why do greedy corporations need this underhanded welfare ? The foreign workers will not be paying Social Security taxes and the large corporations involved will wiggle out of having to pay payroll taxes. 

Social Security and Medicare will be in for another beat down. This scam is in DIRECT VIOLATION of the pledge foreign workers take to return to their own countries after receiving their degrees.

WE DO NOT NEED THIS PROGRAM....EVER !!!!!!!! THIS president TOOK AN OATH TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. ALL I HAVE SEEN THE PAST 7 YEARS IS CONSTANT AND CONTINUED ATTEMPTS TO HARM THE JOBS OF AMERICAN WORKERS.ENOUGH , STOP THIS NEW ATTACK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
