I strongly support the proposed OPT 24 month extension rule. It gives a chance to the hardworking students to enhance their knowledge and at the same time make some contributions to the American Economy. Recent studies have shown that the STEM graduates play a very vital role in the in the American Engineering companies. So if you have more workers working here in USA, this would create a surplus workforce. This would help the employers find local talent and would help in reducing outsourcing. In addition to that, USA is a land which guarantees that no matter who you are and where you come from if you are willing to work hard, you will succeed. I believe that this OPT 24 months STEM extension will do justice to the talents of the students and will give them an opportunity to work here and succeed. So I am in all support of this 24 months OPT STEM extension.
