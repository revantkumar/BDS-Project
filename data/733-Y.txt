I strongly agree and support OPT extension. 
Originally OPT extension was 17 months, that was an important reason that US universities were more attractive to international students than European universities, which allowed international students had opportunity to explore their academic fields and gain more working experience with what they leaned. I myself is such an example, who chose university here, got a job in electrical engineering field after graduation, and is in the 17 months OPT extension period. I can feel the importance of my role to my company and it will be a large loss to the company if I cannot continue my work there. If this 24 months OPT extension cannot be approved, a lot talented international students wont consider come here to study and even they choose to come here, they cannot stay after graduation. I can see 80% of my classmates in my graduated school are international students, if they dont choose here or cannot stay, the industry will suffer lacking of new blood, and local students will have less communications with outside world. Whats the harm to attract talented people and gather all smart brains to make the world better?
Someone said OPT students were hired due to low salary, so local people cannot get a job. I dont think so. We get a quite attractive salary. There is a salary standard based on your skills not your visa type. People who cannot get a job should improve their own skills instead of being jealous of other people who are better than you and find a way to push them out. Competition makes us better, makes the world improve, thats why US is one of the most powerful country. Please keep going on the right way, dont make the world disappointed.
