I am a technical recruiter at Facebook and I think we should allow a 24 months extension for STEM students. First and foremost, I must clarify that we hire employees SOLELY based on their technical knowledge, communications, and team work. Therefore some of negative comments which address the incompetence of international students are absolute nonsense. In fact, we hire a large amount of new grad international students who are using their OPT. They are one of the reasons that our company grow so fast and have done so many projects. This also applies to other tech companies like Google and Apple. If OPT extension was revoked, there would definately be a huge impact on these top companies, the myth of Silicon Valley would probably gone as well.
