I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 
1: I finished my undergraduate and master in U.S., I am living here for more than 6 years already, we should have our own right to choose to stay or leave, instead of leave due to the VISA problem. We pay to learn knowledge from U.S., and we should have the opportunities to contribute to the industries or organization that we love. 

2: As we all know, there are a lot of international students/faculty contributed tremendous growth to U.S economy and development. It is not hard to see in the big Technology company, the international employees are an indispensable part of their growth. 

3: the diversity is very important for the U.S.

4: Give international students job opportunities is not going to lower domestic's salary, instead, we can help provide more job opportunities to grow and develop together.
