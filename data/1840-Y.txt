I support to extend OPT to 24 months.
One of my friends did a technology program, which could make the company he worked for earn much money and create more job positions. However, the OPT extension was just 17 months at that time. So he must go back to his country.
Because he was one of the main members at that team, the program has stopped for a long time.
If he could gain 24 months OPT at that time, he would finish the program and created more job positions for the company.
