I thank DHS for coming up with the improved STEM rule which would attract many research scholars in the field of Science,Technology Engineering and Math across the globe to US . Good to see DHS realizing and categorizing the STEM OPT rule as economically significant rule for United States rather than an immigration benefit . This would give enough time and opportunity for students to gain the practical knowledge in their respective fields and help United States to achieve their economic goals. I once again thank all personalities who helped DHS to come up with this rule and would love to see it get implemented as soon as possible.
