I strongly support this rule for sevral reasons, which are listed as follow:

1.The United States is a counrty that offers every person equal chance no matter where he/she comes from.If these talented stduents even do not have opportunities to land jobs in the US, it will be a pity both for the US economic boost and for students themselves.

2.Nonimmigrant Stuendts who determine to work in the US might feel really disappointed if this rule is ended and it is also detrimental to the US education because it will be less attractive to potential foreign students who plan to study overseas.
