I strongly support to expand OPT for F1 no immigrant students with Stem degrees and Cap-cap relief for all eligible f1 students.
There are tons of reasons to do it. Here I only listed few of the main points, which is beneficial for US and employers, common citizens. 
1) first of all, immigrants created high tech and jobs for US. As we know America is the leader of high tech in the world now. Immigrants such as Steve jobs, and Elon musk created the greatest high tech companies. These companies created ton of jobs and tax for US. So in long run, give F1 students opportunities to keep this trend which is major engine for the booming of high tech.
2)U.S. Need stem students to fill the gap in the markets. U.S. Companies need engineers, statisticians, and professors in STEM. 
3) Stem majors attract the most intelligent students in the world to study in US . Longer OPT will give them chance to work and decide to stay or leave US, which is benefit for US and the world. 
So I strongly support this bill.
