Tianyu Zhou I strongly support this rule.

Firstly, it is important for a STEM student to learn much more practical knowledge and training before he/she formally goes to a career and handles a task individually. OPT provides necessary connection between campus study and enterprise working. 

Secondly, enterprises and companies can find more skilled and suitable employees with OPT. This will promote the productivity of US and benefit the US people, for example, better productivity will decrease the price of goods.

Thirdly, OPT STEM Extension will attract more outstanding students to US and provide convenience for them to stay in US. America is built on the base of culture and custom of immigration, and the wisdom and wealth of immigration has made, is making and will continuously make a magnificent history of America.
