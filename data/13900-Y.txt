I strongly SUPPORT new OPT proposal, because this proposal will help to attract a lot of STEM talents come to the U.S. for their study and then contribute to the U.S. in return. If no such good mechanisms, why those talents should choose U.S.? Many European countries also provide attractive polices to attract talents to study and work there, and the tuition fees are much cheaper there.
