I think the current OPT policy is not that beneficial to international students. Even for local American students, it takes a few months for them to get a job after graduat. This is no way an uncommon phenomenon. A lot of international students don't have job offers within 3 months after graduation. Therefore they leave the country before having a chance to learn in the US working environment. This is not the purpose of OPT. Second, after landing their jobs, students work maximally one year in the United States. If you put this in a time span under an organization. At this stage the new graduates just go through the initial training, officially become adept entry level employees. If they leave at this time, would be a loss to both the companies and them. I doubt companies would have enough time and interaction with the recent graduates to evaluate if they would sponsor them, based on the fact that the chance to get H1B is low. This situation gives company a higher pressure to hire an international student at the first place. But if they do offer the job positions, that means the international is more competitive compared to the pool of the candidates. And this leads to the point of by the end of the OPT, it's both the loss of the US company and the students.
