I think the proposes to amend previous F-1 non-immigrant student visa regulations on optional practical training (OPT) is inevitable, As International students need more time to fit in with new work environment, such as the workflow of a company, its colleague, and practice the knowledge they learnt from university, which need more than 12 months to conduct. In some situation, an employer is not willing to assign some assignments that might practically significant for intern to their intern with merely 12 months period. In a words, long time OPT is a sensible choice to relief those issue. I uphold it.
