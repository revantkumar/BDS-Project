I will definitely support this proposal.

There are thousands of international students get their jobs at IT company, they are brilliant and have high educational background, but only 50% of them can get H1B visa every year. If the OPT extension is canceled, the rest of these people will have to leave America immediately. This will definitely be a significant loss for American economy.

Stopping OPT extension is not a wise action, which will certainly damage the attraction of US education system and further reduce the economic vitality of USA. Trading 4 billion dollar loss in tax to exchange for 110 billion gain in the economy is a good deal. I believe everyone will make the correct calculation.

American is the most powerful country because our nation takes the best of all that GOD has given to the world. Each year foreign students and scholars come to US for education and conference. Our great nation should always keep open to those talents, especially for those technical engineers workers .

In conclusion, expanding the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students will greatly benefit America and the students themselves, thus it should be approved.
