US's non-farm payroll jobs have been keeping added on and on in a trend since the policy of OPT extension for STEM was implemented, which shows this policy did not hurt any chances that for a competent American would be hired. On the contrary, the policy facilitates and accelerates the US economy's growth and recovery. More and more US companies have been founded in recent years due to available and affordable technical labor supply. This trend also created more jobs for Americans.

OPT expanding would do good for you, for us and for US!
