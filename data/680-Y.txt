Opt extension rule benefits US citizens for the following reasons: 1. US department of Commerce has reported that international students contributed over 27 billion dollars to US economy in 2013/2014. The international students who is working for companies of United States made a great contribution to stimulating the whole country's economy, which leads to creating more jobs for US citizens indirectly. 2. The first competitiveness of United States comes from technologies and science, such as computer science, physics and mathematics. Whether you'd like to admit it or not, those international students are really good at and have professional skills in those fields. For the further international students, US is definitely not the only choose for them to choose to get educated. Right now, the long opt period is one of the prime reasons for them to choose US to study since it gives them more time to improve their skills in the industry. If this policy has been canceled, choosing to study in any other foreign-welcome country will become a better choose for them. In this case, most international-student-related job positions in the college and university might be influenced. And US citizens who is working there might lose their jobs. It's a vicious circle. 
I think we should make decisions based on the long-term interests. In the long run, this rule will benefits the whole country! So I strong support for it.
