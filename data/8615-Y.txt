I strongly support this proposal. Here are the reasons make me believe so.

I. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. STEM degrees holders are typically foundation of a prospered economy. Almost everything we use in this modern era are benefited from those specialized people who are in STEM area. I cannot imagine what this world would be today if we don't have computers, Internet, airplanes, bridges, radio, medical appliance, electricity and many more countless products we heavily rely on in our daily life. None of those are brought to us without STEM people's constantly contribution. So STEM people are important to U.S. especially for those who qualifiedly obtained B.S. degree and even higher degrees from U.S. university and educational institutes. 

II. Longer OPT term would help attracting talented students from all around the world to come to U.S. for further study. This would help U.S. universities to strengthen their ability of research and have good reputation in the world. 

III. Qualified STEM students are young, passionate and creative. They have great potentials to contribute a lot to this economy. Qualified STEM students usually have higher incomes than overall average U.S. income. They contribute in taxes. They spend money thus to support our economy. They can create more job opportunities from outcome of their research and hard working results. 

IV. If we don't pass this regulation, we are actually forcing those talented people to leave U.S. to other countries. As we all know, U.S. is a immigration country and our prosperity are brought by talented and dedicated immigrants from all over the world. If we lost those talented people, we would have definitely lost our competitivity over other countries and U.S. cannot be the greatest country in this world anymore.
