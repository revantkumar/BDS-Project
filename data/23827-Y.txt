I TOTALLY SUPPORT this proposal. International STEM students actually DO NOT jobs from American students.

From my experience, I found in my university, the engineering school is much smaller than those business school in terms of enrolled students, however there are more international students in engineering school. And, I found native American students might take fundamental courses rather than more advanced classes, such as, power electronics, power system analysis. In fact, most students in these courses are international students.

It's not hard to tell that the STEM international students are looking for job opportunities requiring high level of expertise, most of which native students are not interested in. 

Last but not least, native master students in my school DO NOT have a hard time in finding jobs. The native graduates usually went to better companies like Vishay Dale Electronics, National Instruments.

International STEM students actually do NOT take American students' jobs. The STEM jobs are taken by the international students is simply that companies cannot find a native candidate with required expertise.
