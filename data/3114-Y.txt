American jobs need to be filled by American citizens. Period. Citizens that will add to the strength and health of our economy, not detract from it. We as a country need to focus on educating and then, utilizing the tremendous amount of talent already within our borders. That is how we rise to the top. I'm all for helping out people when they need a hand, but right now, WE need the help!!
