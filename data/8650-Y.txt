I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities
stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.
4. this will keep bring new students to come
and learn in USwhich will definatly increase the education income to help university contribute to their local students as well
