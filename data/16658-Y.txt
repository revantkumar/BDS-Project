I strongly support the OPT program to allow foreign students study and train in the US.

This country has gone insane with anything immigration-related. These foreign students are nothing like the one who craw over the borders, if you know what I mean. These students are stimulating our economy! In California, about 50% of the luxury car I sold was bought by these students. You cannot believe how they can just come in and pay cash for a $50k car. Of course, most of our servicing customers are foreigners too. Our mechanic would be out of a job, if it was not for these foreign customers. I respect anyone here through a legal process, either by school or through work.

On the other hand, the real problem is those illegals. They stole our job!!!! They open ghost dealerships, provide unprofessional cheap labor. They are the one we should keep out of the country.

The legal foreign students and skilled workers, who are trained properly to our American standards, are more than welcome to stay, as long as they are legal!

I support the OPT program.
