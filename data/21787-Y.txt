At the end of the day, this question is about whether the United States wants to keep the best and brightest in its own economy. Let's face it, STEM grads will find jobs, either in the US or elsewhere in the world. Corporations today will be able to source talent, especially in the field that the STEM grads are in. If we do not keep them in the US today, the job will be outsourced to other countries, e.g. India. In fact, this has been the case for the last decade. 

What happens if the job is outsourced? Well, when they receive their pay package, they certainly are not spending it in the US. Less spending, less growth, less jobs for all of us: it's that simple. Do we want to protect one category of US citizens at the expense of all others? That's not democracy.

Not let's turn to the scenario where OPT extension is approved, STEM students get to work in the industry that they are in. What will happen? They will pay rent, buy cars, eat out, pay taxes, etc. Just like the rest of us, they contribute to the US economy instead of contributing to the Indian economy or Chinese economy. They make money, but we get to keep the money that they make by providing goods and services to them. Again, more jobs for all of us.
