I strongly support this rule for extending the OPT STEM extension from the current 27 to 36 months. Facts have shown that half of all startups are founded by immigrants and particularly students who have graduated from universities in the US. It doesn't make sense to throw out these students who are equipped with all the skills and knowledge to keep the US economy at the front. Talent is the greatest asset that any country can posses and it is incumbent on the government to attract and retain these individuals in the country. These potential immigrants are a part of high tech workforces who will drain less resources on the government but infact grow the economy by creating jobs for citizens. 

The US will always be a land of immigrants, a country founded by individuals who came to its shore for a better life.
