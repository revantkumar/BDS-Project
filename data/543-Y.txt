I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. America admits international students for a reason. They hope that these internal elites can make continuous contribution to the country. If the well-educated elites go back to their country, it will be a very big threats to America. 

2. Allowing foreigners to work in the US can help to motivate native Americans. With proper and greater competition, the US citizens tend to work harder, enhance will provide better results.
