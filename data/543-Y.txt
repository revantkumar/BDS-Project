I strongly support the rule. It's hard to imagine world biggest economy to be created or survive at forefront position without using best brains of this world. Contribution of immigrants in paddling the economy is much more higher than native people. United States owes much of its success to all those immigrants who are behind running some of the biggest multinational organization in this world with their head quarters here. US has always been a country of immigrants, by the immigrants and for the immigrants. 

Welcoming immigration rule is of prime importance at a point where other countries are not far behind in the race of enticing the best brains from world population to their country. Take a close look at immigration reforms to welcome even more international students and skilled workforce to Singapore and Canada and its positive impact on their economic growth in recent years. International students are the biggest pillars of job creation, wealth generation and keeping diverse culture. Those who are able to make it to US are the best breeds every single country is looking for. Any negative message for wold's best brains would push US into an irrecoverable state and make it more of an incompetent nation in a very short time. 

In my opinion US must be very positive about immigration policies and should wisely try to project itself as the best destination for the best breed on earth.
