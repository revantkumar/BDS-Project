Extending the OPT is extremely important for the development of technology and economy in United States! The technology companies in US need a huge amount of workers great at science and engineering and a large part of the smart people are international students who worked well and completed many hard study programs in the universities in US. Clearly there are more benefits than disadvantages to extend the OPT because this extension will provide more outstanding technical worker to meet the increasing demand of scientists and engineers in those companies. International students can do outstanding works in STEM fields, and sometimes even better than the American students because they are strong in math and engineering courses, more importantly they can keep struggle the hard problems a lot longer than the American students util the problems are solve, so that's why technology companies hire so many international workers because of their strong abilities to make the companies better. They have proved their outstanding ability to work in US because they get the chance to work in companies by passing the interviews and finished their tasks well during internships. During work, international students can make a lot of contributions to companies and the development of the economy to US. So I strongly suggest extending the OPT longer since US need more international workers to solve the hard problems that American students don't want to solve!
