I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1) it is very helpful for talented young foreigners to have opportunity working in US, thus our competititors (EU, China) would suffer from these talent loss.

2) Many Stem students works for high-tech companies and these companies are relied on these talents in a ceratin way. Without Stem OPT, our high-tech companies could not develop as fast as now since Stem students could not live in US for a long time.
