As a engineering major student, I strongly support the extension. Because America is a country of freedom and consists of multiple cultures, the chance for everyone should be equal. STEM foreign students don't mean to take all jobs from Americans, but equally compete for a chance to work in US. If you are capable to do your job, you should get this opportunity.

When I graduate from my college, I still face the huge pressure of finding a job. The extension give us, who also want to make ourselves, the world better, more opportunities. Of course, if I am not good enough to do my job, this problem won't exist anymore. Please be wise and calm with it.
