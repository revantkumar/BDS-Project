Mia Wu I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. It's a win-win for both the USA and the international STEM students. I read some negative comments. But it seems that those people voting against this extension even don't understand the real situation here in America. They thought STEM majored foreign students stole jobs from US workers. But in fact most of those students work as engineers or in research and development department of high-tech company after their graduation. They actually don't compete with American workers at all. Instead, some of them created many job opportunities for local workers by founding their own company. The existence of OPT extension for STEM majored foreign student is precisely because native graduate can not meet the need of those high-tech companies.
