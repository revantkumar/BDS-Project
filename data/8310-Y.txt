I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because it's irrational to spend money on educating people who later can't work here. If we decide to admit international students, we should make sure that they can pay back and strengthen United States. It's cruel to show them all the wonderful opportunities America can offer but then force them to leave and use their talent somewhere else. If we're serious about calling ourselves a "country of immigrants", let's show that we still understand innovation.

As an international PhD student in chemistry at UC Berkeley and an alumnus of Yale University, I want to be able to further scientific progress here. Legal immigration status does not guarantee me a job. If there are better candidates, I just won't get a job and I'm OK with it. However, if my skills can be used in this country, why should you waste years spent on my education.
