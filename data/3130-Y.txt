Alina Dong I fully support the proposal to extend OPT to 24 months for STEM international students, which would not only benefit STEM students to allow them to have more opportunities to find internships to apply what they learned at school in the US, but also benefit the US economy.

According to the Institution of International Education, a total of 886,052 international students are enrolled in the 2013-2014 academic year, up by 13.7% compared with 764,495 from 2011-2012 year. Those international students were, are, and will be playing a significant role in driving the economic growth of the US economy, as they are paying significant tuitions, living and travel expenses every year. However, if the OPT extension is cancelled, the willingness of international students to study in the US would decrease as well, since they won't have enough time to take practical training to improve their skills.

If the 24month OPT extension is approved, we will surely expect more and more international students applying for the US universities and colleges, which will definitely help drive the economic growth.
