I personally provide a strong support for this policy. This OPT Extension will help the international students to gain sufficient work experience before returning to their home countries. Longer OPT duration will attract more talented international students from all over the world who will contribute to the US education and economy. Diversity and equal opportunity are US spirits, which will promote social progress and development.
