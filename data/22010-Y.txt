I strongly support this ruling. 

First off, STEM graduates are NOT illegal immigrants. This does not seem to be clear to many of the comments below, and again this ruins their credibility on their ability to reflect on this issue. STEM graduates are mostly brilliant students with great potentials in their respective careers. 

Competition exists, but is not that bad. Nor is it detrimental to the American society. Americans still have the edge in the job market since many startups are UNABLE to provide H1B visas to international students. This ruling merely allows more students to stay at their current paths for longer. 

America has always posed itself as the leader of the free world. Do not lose these amazing talents to Canada or Europe!
