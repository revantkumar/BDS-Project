I highly support this proposed rule since it is beneficial to the USA in many respects. This rule will attract more International students, who pay much higher tuition fees than local students, to study in the US. Universities, especially public schools, depend heavily on those international students to raise funds and improve education nowadays. Those well educated great talents can make great contribution to many industries such as IT, Finance, and various engineering areas after they graduate.
