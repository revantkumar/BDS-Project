I am a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley. I took a gap year after college to intern at university and national research labs before attending UC Berkeley. The extra research experience provided me very solid skills to embark on cutting-edge research at UC Berkeley. This experience would not be possible without OPT. I believe the United States is the strongest nation in the world for a special reason--it's the most welcoming country to immigrants and provides opportunities to capable foreigners. Extension of OPT is not only a sign showing the welcoming attitudes of the US government, but an opportunity for foreign individuals to demonstrate their contributions to the fullest. Bringing together the brightest people from around the world is a mutual benefit to both the United States and the individuals. I highly suggest the US government to improve and expand OPT opportunities for F-1 students.
