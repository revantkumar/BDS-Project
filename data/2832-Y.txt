Lynn lin Yes! I strongly support this proposed rule.
Firstly, this is a win-win strategy for both STEM degree international student and US. On one side, STEM international students have made great contribution to US high technology companies which pay tax for IRS. Many companies' CEO are STEM international students. They 
gain their first job opportunity during their OPT. For international students in US, OPT is the only opportunity to apply their knowledge in US industry.
What's more, research has shown that foreign students who earn a degree and remain in the United States are more likely than native born workers to engage in activities, such as patenting and the commercialization of patents that increase U.S. labor productivity. Which means, international students work more hard on their position.
Finally, I'm a Chinese STEM student and my parents are in china, I would return back China eventually. I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.
