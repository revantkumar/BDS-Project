I think one should not judge a proposed rule is good or not based on his/her benefit. When there is a job offer to someone, it will definitely close the door for others. However, from the company perspective, to maximum the chance of their success, they should select the one with best skill that fit the job, rather than their status as citizen or non-citizen. 

It is the same concept for either company or country. The way a country grow stronger and wealthier is find the best person in charge of the right position, create more jobs in general for people, rather than to secure each individual of citizens' job. Through this, there will be more job opportunities to all work-force.
