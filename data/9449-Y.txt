Ming Mu In my opinion the extension is important and necessary, as explained below: 
1. America is a country of immigrants because of its inclusiveness and equality. A lot of talented immigrants were foreigners at first place. 

2. People from different cultures can provide different perspectives and skills on solving problems, which is what companies are looking for. 

3. With the extension, students from other countries have more time to practice what they learned in school in their job positions after graduation, which does not only help boosting US economy but also attracting more students to come to study in US.
