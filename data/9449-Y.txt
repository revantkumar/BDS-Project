I think this is a great opportunity for the STEM international students in U.S. More significantly, it will benefit America economically, culturally and even educationally in the long term.

Undoubtedly, foreign technical and scientific workers (which mostly consists of international students)have largely benefited American economy for a long time. In all the technical and scientific companies and institutes, foreigner workers have been working hard for the achievement in their fields, and most of them have made big achievements for U.S and even world society. 

Because of the great opportunities that U.S has given to these foreigners, U.S has improved in different fields in STEM in the recent years, and all of achievements largely rely on the policies that enable foreign workers to work in this country.

Also because of the OPT session, foreign talented students can have a working experience in U.S, which enables them to learn new things that they have never learned in their own countries, and afterwards these students also bring back the knowledge to their own countries. This is also one of the benefits that U.S give to the world.
