I am against allowing any more foreign workers into this once great country. The ones here now are misplacing many Americans and knocking them out of their jobs. In many cases, the Americans are being forced to train their foreign replacements. This is so wrong, it adds insult to injury. With unofficial unemployment levels at 25 to 30% in this country, how can bringing in more foreign workers help? It cannot, it can only hinder honest Americans in their search for full time employment which is becoming more and more elusive due in large part to "Obamacare" and the expense that the insurance payments are putting on employers. Our children now are having a great deal of difficulty finding and keeping full time jobs. Many friends and acquaintances can find only low paying, no insurance jobs that make it very difficult for them to support themselves. 

Please, listen to what the people of this country want. What we do NOT want is more immigrants or foreign workers brought into this country to usurp the jobs of once hard working Americans.
