I applaud the proposal of extending training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. I believe that the overall effect of this proposal will be positive for the country and society. These international students contribute a large portion of the tuition, study really hard and are extremely talented. They should be given enough opportunities instead of being pushed, frustrated and marginalized. These students are future entrepreneurs, engineers, great employees. I believe the US government should understand who and what they are sending away before they actually do so.
