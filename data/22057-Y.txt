I absolutely support the OPT extension to 24 months, because there is no reason that the US government should shut international students out after providing (probably) them fine education opportunities. To me, it is a huge loss for the US if majority of the (skilled) international students just leave after graduation, and the US government should do everything they can to keep these intellectuals other than push them away.
