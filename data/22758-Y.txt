I do support OPT and OPT STEM.
1. Please stop the racist H1B and H4 contracting companies like Infosys, Tata CS, Cognizant from overtaking over American
STEM, especially the sensitive IT industry. More than 50% of H1B visa has been used for workforce importing from foreign to US.
2. Fix the H1B and L1 program that are all but monopolized by Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and HCL, Deloitte and Accenture. Those companies are applying more than one visas for one applications to make sure they have higher possibility to get visa, this is abuse of H1B and unfair to other people, this is more urgent to be fixed.
Foreign students pay premium dollars to get an American education, and deserve a little payoff, a little American dream. The American public
will also benefit from the best and brightest international talents.
Without Opt, American education industry will risk a death spiral because foreign
students and parents will wake up to the scam.
