I am a master student majored in math, under OPT now. When I applied for the master program, US's program was my first choice, the reasons, of course, included US has the best education resource, best social environment, best finance markets... but most important is the 29 month OPT period. I have enough time to apply what I learned during this period in this great country where American Dream comes from. That is why I only applied programs in US, not UK, not Canada, not any other countries. But now the OPT extension may not exist, I feel like I am been treated as a fool. When we were applying for the STEM programs, we were actually applying for the 29 month OPT behind the programs , and now when we are using this OPT, thinking of we have 2 years to apply in US, and got informed we actually maybe leave this country in one year. 

Why? 
We are now in information era, does US's job market have no more vacancies for STEM student interns? 
US's law is known as a great guarantee for everyone being treated equally, and STEM student can only get extension in e-verify companies, does the OPT extension hurt the equality ? 
US is famous for attracting and retaining talents, after educating foreign students a few years, won't US wait more time to let the real talents show themselves up through their intern work? 

US is a great country, US is keeping more and more prosperous, the engine of it is US attracts the top talents, develops the average talents, and educates the future talents. I hope the engine keeps working, and all the foreign student have enough time and room to become talents in US.
