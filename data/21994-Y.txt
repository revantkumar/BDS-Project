Immigrates contributed a lot to the development of US economy and culture. It is really necessary to get this proposal approved. Some people think international students take their jobs. But the truth is that all of my American friends found a job right after graduation and the majority of them have more than 3 offers. However, the international students only took the one that they are not willing to do. Further to that, it is gonna be a great loss that companies train an employee for a year, have to find another one, and spend tons of money on training the next one.
