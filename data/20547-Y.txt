I highly support to extend opt extension coz US economy relies on hight tech and finance sector. However, foreign students with high degree form the foundation for those sectors. The majority of entry level programmer and analyst come from India, China, Russia, and etc. Most of them are stem students with major in cs, ee, stats, math, physics, quantitative finance. In order to maintain United States leading position all over the world, US needs those foreign elites to work for the country
