I strongly support this rule. My major is STAT and I have a few American classmates. If this opt rule is not passed, our OPT would be only one year. In this case, we STAT international student have to go back our country after one year. But, we just get work experience during this year and become qualified workers. In the other word, American companies give us work experience during one year and we can't work for them next year. At the same time, American companies give new international students one year experience without reward, which is a bad circle. Since American students seem like they don't like STAT major, this OPT rule will bring more good STAT people to American Companies.
