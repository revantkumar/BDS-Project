I have a friend who had already applied for the STEM OPT because his OPT program has expired, but the court has changed it and almost leaves him with no choice but to be deported unless the program is extended. He is not technically an American citizen, but he has lived in the US for essentially his entire life. He is an American and he should be able to stay here and continue working for the betterment of the American people.
This is unfair and I would very much like to see this program extended.
