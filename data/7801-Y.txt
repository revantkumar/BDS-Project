Linda Horn I cannot believe that our government is doing this to the American workers. You should be ashamed. There are Americans needing and wanting these jobs. Our grandson has a Masters Degree and can't find a job. This just isn't fair or in anyway right for our country. Our son, who is a career military serviceman, is currently serving overseas, along with is wife and two children. They are sacrificing their lives so that their children can have a "better" life in the US. Now, their son can't find a job. This is totally Ridiculous!
