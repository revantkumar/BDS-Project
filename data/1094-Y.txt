From a human resource perspective, the extension period of OPT for STEM students will make more sense for the companies who are interested in hiring international students who do not seek for immigration. The period of extended OPT will fit the normal turnover rate of the fast growing consulting firms, where the investments made on them will have enough time to accumulate returns. The unemployment rate created now, is not due to the number of vacancies, but because the gap of job applicant' skill sets and skills required by the market need. The extension of OPT would help decrease the gap and bring the workforce back to the United States.
