I'm a F-1 STEM student and I strongly support the this proposal for the following reasons:

1. The 24-month period will give F-1 STEM students more time to apply for and get a H1b visa. However, this doesn't mean that F-1 STEM students take the jobs that are meant only for the Americans. The current regulations for issuing employer supported H1b visa is doing a good job in preventing excessive foreign workers and is ensuring great opportunities for well-qualified Americans in STEM majors. It's a fair game for the interest of the American economy and workers and foreign talents.

2. Many of F-1 STEM students are brilliant and talented individuals and they are actively contributing to the American economy in many different domains. They can be great resources for the US society. They are playing a good part in the economy now and they could be forever if they can stay in the US. If just because these talents couldn't get a visa to stay and have to leave the US, that's a lost game for the US as other countries are longing for these talents to come back and contribute to their economy.

3. This new proposal is part of President Obama's new immigration policies and I support the president.

Thank you.
