I believe OPT program will greatly contribute to US industry and universities. 
Take computer science as an example. China has very strong internet companies itself and they are fighting hard against US internet companies on Chinese market share. Baidu vs. Google. Wechat vs. Whatsapp. Renren vs. Facebook. Weibo vs. Twitter. Taobao vs. Amazon. Didi vs. Uber. However these Chinese companies share a common concern, in that the best Chinese students in computer science are mostly in US for graduate degrees, and Chinese domestic internet companies find it really hard for recruiting top talents. OPT program is no doubt huge factor for this situation.
If OPT program no longer exists, there will be a huge boost for Chinese internet industry, in that US is no longer an attraction as working place for elites among the globe, and in fact it's willing to push most skilled young foreign engineers right back to help with the growth of Chinese and Indian industry.
Without OPT program universities in US are much less attractive as well. European universities (for example France is mostly famous for its math graduate programs) have been very good choices for foreign students and OPT would just make them look better.
