Xiaoxiao Ren I firmly support this rule. Allowing students with STEM degree to work another two years will definitely benefit American companies and American economy. Look at the American's history. The reason USA is the strongest country in the world is that it attracts the most talented people from all over the world.

I have a suggestion to make the new rule more complete. Please state it clearly in the new rule that students who on Post OPT, still is working on thesis, are allowed to apply for opt extension.
