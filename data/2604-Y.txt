I strongly support this proposal for reasons stated below:

1. The way US develop fast these years is because a large amount of high level talents working here, US government shouldn't only focus on local people, but try to attract those high level talents from all around the world with its tolerance.

2. The fail of this proposal will definitely lead to decrease of amount of students studying abroad, and correspondingly decrease a large part of economy income in many states.
