I support the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire more high quality foreign students to boost the IT industry of the US, which is good for our economy. 

Also, the OPT extension can bring motivation for the potential foreign students to come to study at US. The amount of tuitions that would be paid by the potential foreign students can be tens of billions, which is a vast amount of money (unlike the domestic students, the foreign students are rich and pay the tuition by cash).
