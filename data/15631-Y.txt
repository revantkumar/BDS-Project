I fully support expanding the Optional Practical Training rule proposal by the DHS. Basically the people who oppose this rule expressed two concerns: the foreign students make it harder for American workers to earn a living, and foreign students pay less taxes. Come on, who knows why those people make such two incorrect conclusions. 

First, most of the students who need OPT extension are in engineering major, especially computer sciences. However, look at the graduate students in nearly all universities in the United States. Do you know why the percentage of the American people is so low? Because they are not interested! It is ridiculous to say the foreign students make American people hard to live. They should realize, just because those foreign students work harder than them, they can enjoy the high-tech products developed by the big giant companies.

Second, even in the OPT period, the students have to pay high payroll taxes, especially in New York or California, the taxes take over 1/3 of their salary. However, can they enjoy the benefits of social security and Medicare money? Impossible, no way!

Third, look at the research teams in most universities, especially the post doctor positions in engineering and sciences, can you see how many foreign students work there? Without those foreign people, who are interested in working there?

Above all, all the foreign students in the OPT period contribute too much to this country, and it is those foreign students that keep so many giant high-tech companies and universities going and keep competitive. To the people who oppose the rule, at least you have to work hard as the same as those foreign students.
