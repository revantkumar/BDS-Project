I strongly support this updated rule for the following reasons that are crucial to US and many advanced industry. First, the STEM OPT opportunity provides a great complement and key factor to the US high-tech related labor market. This said, it does not effect the labor market for US citizens but rather provide a great opportunity to students with advanced degrees from US universities. Second, this rule would help private companies as well as many governmental research/science organizations to stay a long engagement with STEM related talents/employees. A longer opt time would allow student/employee to get longer industrial experience that benefit the local economy, companies as well as local communities. In fact, many leading inventions in both academic and industry are contributed and credited to foreign STEM talents. These inventions have transformed and changed American citizen and residents' lives.
