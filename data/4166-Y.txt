Ray Zhang I support the proposed rulemaking. The U.S. government should let F-1 students with STEM degree be able to work here so that they can make contribution to the U.S after their graduation.

I think most of STEM F-1 students are young people, and they are health and not likely retired. They will help carry the financial burden such as health insurance and retirement, but not likely use it. 

Considering STEM F-1 students are usually not good at language or communication skills (or culture?) as native, and they are not likely have any strong network in U.S., finding a job is not as easy as thought for STEM F-1 students unless they are highly skilled. Keep STEM-student in U.S. somehow make high tech company more competitive, and in turn retains more jobs (for instance, high tech company will not move oversea).
