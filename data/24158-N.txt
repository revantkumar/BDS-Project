It is time to stop the Obama Administration expanding of the "Optional Practical Training" (OPT). We need jobs and security 
for our own citizens.

OPT allows foreign students who hold an F-1 student visa to work for up to 12 months in a job that's related to their field 
of study. 

The Obama Administration wants to expand it to 36 months for foreign students pursuing degrees in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

It is just un-American to allow and encourage these people to stay in this country and take jobs away from us and our children.
