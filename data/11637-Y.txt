I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..
2. Students who can get jobs means they are really outstanding and U.S. need these talent students to work for them
3. all student about opt extension are studying physics, engineering, chemical and other area. And these area really lack of U.S. students.... international students are not get U.S. people's job, they are working for U.S. people.
