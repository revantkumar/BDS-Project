I highly agree that improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 STEM students and cap-gap relief for all F-1 students is an excellent action.

Someone may say that expanding OPT for F1 students will reduce the jobs for Americans citizens. That is ridiculous. The F1 students are not taking over citizens' jobs. they only occupied high-tech job, which needs a lot of high-education people. The students have no conflict of interest with general Americans citizens.

the economics of America relies a lot on high-tech corporations, which recruits large numbers of students with STEM degrees. if the OPT for F1 students is only 12 months, then there will be fewer F1 students willing to hunt job in USA. However, if the OPT is expanded, more F1 students will begin their career in USA, do the entry-level work and contribute large amount of GDP.

When the OPT expires, the students will leave USA. So improving OPT doesn't mean the rise of number of immigrants.

USA is a renowned for its spirit of inclusion and freedom. I don't know what the dissenting people are thinking about. They enjoy the benefit brought from nonimmigrants, but don't want to acknowledge it. Maybe they just want USA to be a closed and exclusive country.
