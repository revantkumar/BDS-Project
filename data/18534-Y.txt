I strongly SUPPORT the proposal!
Firstly, we get our education, learned our knowledge in US, why shouldn`t we contribute our knowledge to US society?
Second, United States has always been considered as a well diversified country. There are many successful people who were international students before they got great achievements. A country got to have an open-minded and diversified environment to become a great country. You NEED us!
Third, 24 month extension is never too long, only one year you can`t be able to build a successful start-up company, but 3 years in total , there will so much opportunities for start-up companies to build and grow, those are also great career opportunities for US citizens.
Besides, OPT extension can enable post-doctors have enough time to approach their study achievements. One-year is too short for a study to be generated, modeled, tested, and finally completed. 

Overall, if there`s no extension, there will definitely great impacts on development of new start-ups and educational studies
