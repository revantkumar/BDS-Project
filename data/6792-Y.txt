I highly support this rule and want to extend the OPT STEM Extension period from proposed 24 months to 36 months in addition to the original 12 month OPT Period so that students can come out of the H-1 loop. I also request DHS to bring a new rule for providing Greencards to students who have done master's degree in US in EB-1 category so that they can get their green cards very quickly and not worry about the visa status.
