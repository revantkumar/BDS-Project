I strongly support this rule because I write below,
F1 students come over here with expectations of exposure to real world technical issues and professional enhancements. OPT helps us to meet the technical professionals and understand their style in resolving issues. One year OPT just helps us to understand the technology and won't give any exposure to real world scenarios, because we need 9 months to understand and practice the technologies that organizations required and 3 months to understand the organizations business. This means organizations has to invest in us almost one year to prepare to solve their issues, so with one year OPT no organizations won't like to invests in us and won't train F1 students. Means, F1 students miss the opportunity of learning real world technical issues. Three years OPT is good for students and more useful for organizations as they get their return on investment into F1 students. 
If you see the history, Google, Apple, and Microsoft are born with University grad students only and they made this world better place, so giving opportunity to F1 grad students will help the world to make it even more better place.
