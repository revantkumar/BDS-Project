The proposed rule on STEM extension is a very reasonable and clever policy. It benefits substantially to the US economy while allowing foreign students to earn their tuitions back, keeping attracting them to contribute to US industries, research institutions, and etc.

US need the strongest, most capable workers to help its economic growth; companies hiring talented F-1 non-immigrant students for up to 3 years will be the optimal solution. Sin the first few months of employment will involve massive training, it is important to keep foreign new employees for a reasonable amount of time, and not just a year. The current one-year authorized employment alone is insufficient for US companies to gain substantial profits from foreign employees. Thanks the new rule for being supportive on retaining F-1 STEM students.
