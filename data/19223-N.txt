We need to put American citizens to work, NOT import more foreigners to take jobs Americans can do. Immigrants, legal 
and illegal, are invading America in record numbers. Out of the immigrants working, most are working for cash with no taxes 
withheld, yet still able to cash in on the entitlement system here. The ones that are not working are being subsidized by 
Americans as well. Just who does the federal government consider first priority? Who is behind this planned and systematic 
destruction of our nation? I don't believe for one moment that the decision makers are stupid, in fact they know exactly what 
they are doing. I want to see some pro-America legislation that is going to help Americans for a change! There are 
Americans everywhere trying to find work and in way too many cases foreigners are favored over our own citizens. Let's put 
our own national pride, the ability for Americans to support their family, and the middle class FIRST for a change!
