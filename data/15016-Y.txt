I am an international student in automotive engineering. I am going to get my phd degree next year. I work on connected automated vehicles. I chose the US for my PhD study because Ford is where the auto industry started. My research is right on the frontier of automotive technology. Google/Apple/Uber/Ford/GM/... Dozens of companies are venturing into the next generation of smart cars, for a cleaner and safer road transportation system tomorrow. My skills can help the US to become the leader of auto industry once more, beating the research centers in Asia and Europe. Longer OPT helps me to contribute to US economy better.

I am grateful for the best education the US provides me. My fellowship grant and research assistant salary come from US tax-payer money. I would like to pay it back by working the best years of my life for the US. But it is only possible if I am allowed to. If OPT extension is cancelled and I am compelled to work for European or Asian companies, then the US would be spending all these money helping its competitors. It would be a shame.

On the other hand, while I may occupy one job position of research engineer, my work helps to revitalize the manufacturing industry and to create millions of jobs by making the company I work for more competitive.

A friend of mine went to college in Singapore on their government money. Singapore government had him sign a contract that he must work for Singapore for at least 5 years after graduation. Singapore knows how to do business.

US people, you invested your premier education resources in me. Now is the time to harvest your gains. Don't let the fruit taken by your neighbors!
