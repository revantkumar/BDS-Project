I am vehemently opposed to any legislation or government-sponsored program that incentivizes corporations to expand the hiring of cheap, immigrant labor over fully qualified and educated American citizens who are willing to work. 

The American public is constantly bombarded with a steady drumbeat of being in dire need of more STEM education and STEM qualified graduates. However, only 26% of Americans with STEM degrees work in STEM fields. 

Additionally, if the US education system is in such dire need of STEM programs then why are so many foreigners using the education system in the US to get STEM degrees? 

Lastly, if there really is a "shortage" of STEM qualified American citizens (there isn't) then why have wages been flat for years? 

The reality is that the corporations love the immobility requirements that have been put in place for these foreign laborers and students; these programs amount to little more than modern-day slavery. 

I work in a large corporate office and have seen this pathetic and immoral situation play out many times over the past 15 or so years. We have a state university with 40K+ students and several technology majors in place literally within 5 miles and the company that I work for doesn't even bother trying to recruit students from there. They go straight to the H1B and foreign student programs and leave the American students wondering why they even bothered in the first place.
