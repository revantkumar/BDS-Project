I really like this proposal. 

I am a hiring manager of a tech start-up. Through our hiring process, we found that many international students possess a better skillset than native Americans. From our perspectives, we do not care about their nationality. We just want qualified candidates. If the OPT extension was cancelled. That means it will become hard for us to hire international students as our developers. Because there is not enough qualified American students, that means we will go out of business.
