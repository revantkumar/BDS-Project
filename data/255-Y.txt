I strongly support the proposal. I believe what I'm going to talk about will definitely help to prove my opinion.

1. International students didn't mean to take the job opportunities away from US citizens. Every one has a specific field that he/she is good at. In the STEM fields, we have to admit that international students are more professional and better. On the contrary, they are weaker than US citizens in most degrees of arts. So is it wrong for international students to achieve their careers that they are skilled in?
2. America is such a developed country that needs lots of talents doing various works. Believe me, most IT companies would become a standstill or even broken if this proposal didn't pass. The reason is so simple, most engineers especially software engineers are from China or India. If the legal identification was taken away from them, their contributions to companies wouldn't continue any more. It's serious to consider the prospect of these engineering companies.
3. America is always an open country from the very beginning in its history. This country was founded by Native Americans who were not originally from America. America needs international talents to enhance the economic. Just like Americans can't live without things made in China, America's development can't move fast without international students' contributions.

I truly hope my opinions could be considered.
