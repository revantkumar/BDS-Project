Our daughters are both STEM students, one in college and the other starting in two years. Do not make an already-difficult job hunt even more difficult by allowing foreign graduates take high-tech American jobs. Once they've finished their education, send them home so they can help improve their native countries (possibly lessening the need for those countries to receive aid from America!)
