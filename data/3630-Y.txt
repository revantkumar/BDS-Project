I do support for the USA government to give extended 24 months to STEM students for OPT. With this way, the USA can keep highly educated intellectuals educated by USA to work for USA. Otherwise, it's a bad business for USA itself. There is still a great lacking for positions in scientific and engineering fields, which can be improved by hiring these STEM international graduates.
