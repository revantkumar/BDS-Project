Carol DeBacker The OPT program is a way to DECREASE the number of US STEM Students and graduates. By offering positions to foreign workers, who will cost employers LESS to employ, you reduce the demand for US STEM workers and therefore, the supply. This is counterproductive.

I oppose the OPT program vehemently. As a software professional I can see that the quality of many of these employees is lower than their US counterparts and will further contribute to the reduction of US STEM students and graduates.
