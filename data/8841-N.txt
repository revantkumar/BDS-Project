Why would DHS even consider offering incentives for business to hire foreign STEM students studying and/or extending their education the United States? There are plenty of citizen STEM area students and graduates who these very same companies will not hire, not because they are undereducated but because with citizen STEM graduates and students they have to pay the prevailing wage, not the relative pittance they pay foreigners. For examples in recent history just look to the actions of California Edison and Disney. 
No I am very OPPOSED to this action!! I will be contacting my national and local political representatives to fight this rule. Not only is this overreach, it is detrimental to the lives and livelihood of millions of U.S. citizen STEM workers.
