I sincerely believe that OPT is necessary. Let's imagine that what if there was no OPT at all? Millions of engineers would not be able to stay at America, so they went back to their home countries, primarily China and India, providing enormous number of genius labors for the local technological companies. People like Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella might not be able to stay at America, so they went back to India or went to other countries like China or Japan, leading other giant companies to beat Google and Microsoft. Imagine a world where Sony was led by Nadella and announced their new VAIO book and VAIO pro 4, where Huawei and Xiaomi became the two largest phone producer in the world, where Baidu exceeded Google and became the search engine with most users in the world, where America became too conservative to accept genius from all over the world. Without those talented foreigner, how can a country be developed so strong as the America nowadays is? It was OPT that attract so many foreigner genius and make them contribute to the thriving of America, holding USA's position in the world.
