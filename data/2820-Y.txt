In my opinion, the US is a country with rich culture diversities. That's one of the reasons it keeps creative and lifeful. The creativity in turn attracts more and more elites from various fields around the world. So diversity is very important for the US.

These people from different fields are making contributions to the society. For example, many of the softwares are built for people's convenience by engineers and a large number of innovative engineers are from other countries. Also, as we can see, many excellent professors now in US were international students before. 

I believe the proposal is good for the development of the whole society and country.
