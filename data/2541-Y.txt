I strongly believe the proposed rule provides a win-win situation between U.S. (i.e. academy and economy) and international students who seeks higher education in this country. More specifically, I support the proposed rule for the following reasons:
1.The Optional Practical Training provides great opportunity for STEM students to improve their knowledge and professional skills beyond classrooms, by working for U.S. employers in a field related to their study. This is something that makes the higher education in the U.S. more attractive than that of other countries like European or Singapore. Without OPT, more and more foreign students who want to study STEM fields would not consider the U.S. universities as their first choice as they apply for master/PhD programs. Consequently, the U.S. universities will lose large amount of foreign talents who would otherwise make great contributions to cutting edge research and technology breakthroughs. Moreover, with the population drop of international students, there would certainly be adverse impact on local businesses such as apartment renting, restaurants, entertainment, etc. 

2.The replacement of 17-month extension with 24-month extension is also more than necessary. No matter whether its in industrial companies or research institutes, most projects last for more than 3 years. If a student is only granted with a 12-month OPT period, its almost impossible to complete the tasks. On one hand, the students cant get enough training and become competitive enough when they return to their home countries to seek career opportunities. On the other hand, the companies/organizations will need to spend extra time to find the best replacement for the projects and start the training process all over again. Its just a waste of time and money and would be disrupting to the companys normal operation and workflows.
