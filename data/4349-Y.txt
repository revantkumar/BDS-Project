We should support the STEM degree student, who are mostly working on engineering and science. Those international student come to US to study paying their tuition and all other fees. You know what, scholarship for international student are much harder to get than local student, so they need to work hard and pay everything all by themselves, which maybe their 5 years of saving from China or India. American dream is for people who love this country and try their best, not for people who like to blame and argue about everything but don't try to work hard. 
Stem student are the people who did all their best for the country, like a candle, burning themselves but lighting up the country.
