I supports this STEM extension. As a Potential Student, who planned studying in American, the OPT/STEM program from the United States really attracts me to want to go there.(Since I am a Computer Science potentials)
However, if this proposal is been aborted, I would reconsider the opportunity to go to American.

In this case, I believe the U.S will lose the great amount of educational revenue from those.

It is a win-win case, why not gave us more extension.
