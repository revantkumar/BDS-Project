I storngly support this rule.There are so many unlucky students like me whose opt stem extention will expire before Feb 12, 2016. So please try to pass this rule quickly before 12th Febrauary 2016. If you pass this rule on feb 12th 2016, Please give some exception for the lot of unlucky people like me whose opt stem extensions will expire between Jan 1st 2016 and feb 12 th 2016. If you take this point into consideration and give chance for applying additional 7 moth extention, then it will be great help for lot of people like me. Please take this point into consideration. There are lot of people whose opt stem extention will expire between January 1st 2016 and Febrauary 12, 2016 and without H1B visa.
