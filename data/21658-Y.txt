I oppose this rule to expand STEM Opt longer than 12 months. This rule is being abused by certain employers, particularly "body shoppers" who are using this as a backdoor H1-B program since sponsoring for H1-B has become very expensive and uncertain due to lottery system of picking applications. They are driving down wages considerably and taking jobs away from US.citizens who graduate from STEM programs. 
This program is also abused by certain foreign students who do not get picked by the H1-B lottery system and use the OPT extension to stay in the US and continue applying for H1-B each year until they are picked. Such student are in fast track grad schools (not so well know) that offer degrees in one year and cater to students who are mainly using this STEM benefit of OPT to cheat the system. It is no surprise that employers who have no interest in protecting American jobs are rigorous supporting this rule. Please do not pass this rule which will hurt U.S Citizens in STEM programs and the general wage levels in Information Technology.
