As an international student majoring in mathematics, I am eagerly to find a job in U.S. International students are studying in America, and learning the method of thinking in American style. Although we remain have the problem of the language, we have high expectation to get involved in all walks of life in U.S. In terms of some areas, I do believe we have advantage compared to others. We are very diligent, and willing to work hard. We want to support America to get better, meanwhile, giving ourselves a place to realize our sweet American dream.
