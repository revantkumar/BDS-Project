I, am an international student, support this proposal. My baby was born in USA. I wish him could get better education here than in my country. We've been here for years and we love this country. Now, my husband is using OPT Extention to work. This is the only way ensure us to stay. For the people who against this proposal, thinking of you ancestors, how did they come to this land. Just like them, we make our contributions to this country and wish to stay. USA is a freedom and equal heaven. God bless us.
