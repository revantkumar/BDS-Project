I totally support this rule.
First, giving STEM international students longer OPT time means they can work for U.S. longer. International students use educational resource in U.S., so it is better if they can "pay back" after graduation.
Then, as we know, international students make a decent contribution to the income of universities. Allowing the STEM extension will attract more international students.
Last but not least, we should never forget U.S. should be a equal and free country!
Thanks.
