I think OPT extension will be a great rule for both international students and US local/global companies.

First of all, as for the international students, what is the motivation for them to leave home country and come to US to study? Apparently, it is because students want to gain the most advanced knowledges. But as for science and technology majors, knowledge that taught in the classroom is definitely not enough for student. As far as I know, there are a lot of programs (mostly belong to STEM program) encouraging their students to get more engaged in the real-industrial and learn how to apply their knowledge in the real world. OPT extension will definitely give students more opportunities to gain real-industrial experience. In turn, it can also help enhance the quality of US college education. 

Besides, a high quality education system will certainly attract more students all over the world to come US pursing knowledge. We are all saying that diversity and equality are the most significant elements in American spirit. The pass of this new rule will definitely persist those spirits.

In addition, I believe OPT extension will reduce the stress and cost for both companies and society. If there is only one-year OPT, after 1 year, the company need to look for another candidate to do the same job. Hiring and training new people will take companies a lot of time and money cost. Also, extending OPT period will reduce the overcrowded H1B applicationsbecause people have more time to apply the working visa.
