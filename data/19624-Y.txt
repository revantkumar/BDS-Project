I strongly support the extension for international students especially from STEM program. Generally, the most talented and top students from different countries get admission in any school in USA to pursue higher studies. They stay here for five years or so and gather knowledge from USA and becomes an asset for any countries in the world. So, giving a chance to these young talented people to work here legally also make sense as they are going to make contribution to the advancement of technology in USA with their skills.
