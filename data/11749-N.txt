I oppose ANY regulation NOT enabled by legislation passed by BOTH houses of Congress. OPT violates the promise of graduates to leave the USA within 60 days, enabling graduates to compete for jobs with US Citizens. There ARE adequate STEM workers with US citizenship, they just don't work for the lower wages of non-citizens.
