Makes no sense...I highly doubt there is a shortage of STEM workers....American graduates can easily fill these positions, foreign students not needed. Why do foreign graduates need more training? More study? Why was 4 billion taken out of social security and medicare? Why were 430,000 American students denied these positions (2009-2013)? Why is it to remain "competitive" we need zillions more people , skilled and unskilled ? How in the world did we ever survive the last 200 years? Like I see it, makes no sense and is NOT NEEDED....try citizens first, I know a novel idea but citizenship here has meant less and less as the years go by, it should, though, count for something.
