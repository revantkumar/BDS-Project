I strongly support regulatory action for improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with stem degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. Below are my views supporting the regulation:-

a)Its very important for students to gain practical knowledge after studies in educational institutes to gain complete understanding of the concepts which they learnt theoretically from text books. 
b)To achieve substantial practical training students should be provisioned to work at least 3 years as on an average typical projects would take such amount of time to complete 
c)Students across the globe come to United States to get top notch studies from well-established educational institutes and also understand practical end to end implementation of their education so that they can feel confident going back to their home country and use their experience which they gained from their theoretical and practical knowledge acquired from their stay in U.S. 
d)Also, by not providing such allowance of proper time period i.e., minimum of 3 years for students to gain practical knowledge in U.S. students wouldnt be able to gain complete practical knowledge and thus loss the basic purpose of their education in U.S.
e)Students take a lot of risk to get their education in U.S. Most people take loans to sponsor their studies and they have to leave their family and friends to achieve their dream of reaching the pinnacle in their area of interest. Without proper provision for them to gain such exposure their dreams would be shattered
f)By improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students, American society would be benefited as students get the opportunity to work on their dreams and implement their ideas from theoretical and also practical knowledge
g)I also need to bring to notice that OPT is an immigrant visa which is designed for people who want to return home eventually which there by not having long run social impact 
h)
