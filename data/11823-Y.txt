If anything could steal your job opportunity, it is your own laziness.
Proverb 13:4, The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied. So why not work with diligent people who is also fully knowledgeable, and make a brighter future for the United States of America?
Anyway, I totally support to extend the OPT to 24 months.
