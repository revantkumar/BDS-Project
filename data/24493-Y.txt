At a time when STEM workers in this country are being laid off and replaced with H1B immigrants, I think the question that really needs to be asked is if this bill is going to benefit the citizens of this country, or is it going to benefit big business and the CoC.

What this rule proposes is to create more cheap competition in an already wage stagnant field, hence cause more job loss of citizens.
