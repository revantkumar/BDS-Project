Even though there's no shortage of STEM degree holders, there is a shortage of highly competent STEM degree holders. A lot of people just party through their college years and get a degree, while these international students are highly dedicated to, and passionate about what they do. In school, they're on the dean's list; on the job, they're high performers. If you are good enough and qualified, no matter who you are, you can get your opportunity. This is the land of the free, and equal opportunity. The reason America is the greatest and strongest nation in the world, is because the brightest minds from the world are gathered here. You want this to continue, so you want to let in the great people.

In regard to your comment about employers saving money from payroll taxes. Compared to the hefty sponsorship fees associated with international students, and the chance that the student may leave the company (due to not selected by work visa lottery) after costing the company tens of thousands of dollars of training, the payroll taxes you mentioned are negligible. If you look at the whole picture, international students are more costly to employers. They may not pay social security tax because obviously they are not eligible for retirement benefits... but they do pay many other taxes just like you do. When they become residents, they'll pay all the taxes like you do.
