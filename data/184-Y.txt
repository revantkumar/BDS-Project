This proposal is clearly a reflection on the spirits of the greatest country in the world. Many of these international students pay to study in the U.S. and I believe they deserve their rightful opportunities to gain more working experience here which would do a great favor when they return to there home countries. Besides, the extension is not a guarantee for a green card at all! People who object this proposal are somewhat regional protectionists or others worse that is certainly not helping the healthy diversity in the U.S. In addition, many of those STEM students take the jobs that where mostly under-filled by our native graduates. What harms does it do to keep making us the greatest country in the world? We should spend more time in dealing with illegal immigrants rather than keeping intellectual minds away!!!
