I strongly support this rules.

I am a staff software engineer in FireEye. We need more STEM students, like computer science. If the OPT extension is canceled, lot of employees have to left our company, which will hurt our company a lot!

For STEM students, the working experience is very important. We not only need the knowledge from text book and classroom, but also (more important) is that they should have real industrial experience. They already spend so much money in this country and they also pay tax!

It is United State's spirit to welcome excellent people from other countries as long as they are good! Actually, most of them have at least Master degree or even PhD degree. For United States, we welcome more high tech people from all over the world to contribute their knowledge and energy here. 

It will really disappoint the world if United States abandon talented people!
