I believe improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students is really a good thing. It is really great for large amount of F-1 students who wants to stay in US and work to have more time searching for jobs, because most F-1 students do not have as good languages ability as local students, but they are all intelligent, they had education in US and can improve the US engineering region better. 
It is only because they are not chosen by randomly H1B visa, they need to leave US. The OPT extension policy will largely reduce this probability for losing intelligent students. In addition, it really benefits so many F-1 students who are not working or working and still couldn't get H1B right now.
So I do think this is a really really good policy!! Thanks
