My comments are regarding the following content: 

"B. Summary of the Major Provisions of the Regulatory Action

The proposal would again provide for an extension of OPT for certain F-1 students with STEM degrees. As compared to the 2008 IFR, the proposed rule includes the following changes:
Lengthened STEM Extension Period for OPT. The proposal would increase the OPT extension period for STEM OPT students from the 2008 IFR's 17 months to 24 months. The proposal would also make F-1 students who subsequently enroll in a new academic program and earn another qualifying STEM degree at a higher educational level eligible for one additional 24-month STEM OPT extension." 

I strongly agree with that it will benefit international student a lot by having a 24 months OPT extension instead of 17months. Due the the H1B lottery situation that gets worse and worse every year, i have many international friends who have to leave US just because they did not win the H1B lottery for two times in two years. They had full time job in US and they did really good jobs so it is really unfair and sad for them to leave just because they don't have luck. By extending OPT extension to 24 months. A lot people will be able to get another chance to win the H1B lottery and get to stay in US for a longer time!
