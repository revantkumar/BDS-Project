I strongly SUPPORT this proposal by the DHS to establish new rules of the OPT for students with STEM degrees for the following reasons:
Firstly,this proposal will benefit education of United State.International students are making significant contributions to the U.S economy, through the payment of tuition and living expenses for self and family. Compare with England, Germany and other countries, U.S not only has good education, but also has the OPT and OPT Extension program for international students. That is the reason for most of international students choose the university in US to pursue the master degrees. Without this proposal, U.S may lost the attraction for international students.
Secondly,this proposal will benefit the industry of United State. Some company complained that the existing OPT Extension program is not enough for the international students. If they do not get the H-1B visa, they need to leave. But this proposal will solve this problem. Also, it will increase the attraction for talents, which is good for the industry.
For all the reasons above, I SUPPORT the proposal by the DHS on OPT extension.
