As we all know, advanced technology is pivot to US's economy: it is because more and more appearance of advanced technology that improve people's life quality: we use all kinds of digital products to gain content as well as provide convenience to each other; and advanced technology also attract people who are interested in investment to locate their excessive money in an adequate place, so that they can gain profit at most extent.

The improvement of advanced technology can not leave students who are graduated from STEM. Although there are many native students enter in labor market every year, but I think it would not meet the current labor pool. The technology circle needs more labor to thrive itself. We all know that international students is a relatively important portion in student, and most of them work really hard both in courses and in internship, so it is no wonder there are plenty of competitive STEM international students who have advanced professional knowledge and practice skill to help US's all kinds of technology enterprise, that is ,to help US's economy. When US in a better economy , every people who live in US would live better,too.

So in this page, I suggest the OPT extension is a significant step to maintain and thrive US, since it could make more and more eligible students contribute on a better US!
