Lily Sun I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for following reasons:

1. This proposal is necessary for the US development. A lot of big companies in the US, which have great impact for US development, have difficulties to find the right candidates for their STEM relative positions. For Facebook, it has more than 800 STEM job openings now. Google has about 2000 STEM jobs openings. For these companies, extending the STEM OPT will help them find the right candidates much easier. 

2. Some people might think to extend the OPT period for international students will take the job opportunities from American citizens, because these STEM students are willing to work at a low paid. I think this idea is ridiculous. Many research shows, companies pay the same salaries to the international as citizens. And most of these STEM students come from rich cities, rich families and have good education. They will not be willing to work in a position with unreasonable lower paid than what they deserved, which make them feel invaluable. Thus, I don't think lower pay to international students is a reason to object the this proposal.
