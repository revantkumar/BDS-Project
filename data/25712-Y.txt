I speak highly of this regulation which mean I agree with the OPT STEM students can have 3 years extension. I just finished my graduate study in May 2015. Within these two years of study, I accumulated a lot knowledge about the relative areas, and broaden my horizons. I get to know the gap between my own country and the US. I really want to have an opportunity to accumulated more experience in US company to learn more. Maybe three years is enough for students to gain experience which has positive effective of H1B, it can give more chances for the people who wants to stay longer. For the H1B selection this year, less possibilities for people who really need them. For those who just want to work for a few years, they can use their OPT to stay here.
