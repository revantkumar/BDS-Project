I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.. The government has spent large amount of resources to support international students to get advanced degrees in STEM field. These students can make great contribution to U.S economic and the advancement of U.S technology. The government should allow a longer OPT period to let STEM students make a difference in U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. There have been many foreigner making great achievements in the U.S and help U.S becoming one of the greatest nation in the world. These people include but not limited to Chen-Ning Franklin Yang, Nobel price winner in physics, Mike Krieger, founder of Instagram. A diverse society is helping the U.S.

3. Competition between F-1 and U.S citizen does exist, but this is not a bad thing. The STEM F-1 students can only get employment is science and technology area. They would get hire only because very few U.S citizen are interested and able to the job in these fields, and therefore employers are not able to find citizens suitable for these science and technology positions.
