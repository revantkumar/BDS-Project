Elizabeth Rand I oppose the expansion of the Optional Practical Training Program proposed by ICEB through the Department of Homeland 
Security. 
This proposal not only reduces opportunities for our own 'Homeland US Citizen Students', it reduces opportunities
for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students to become established and successful in their native countries. Their native countries are
more in need which is the original purpose of this program; therefore, allowing extended stays would be in direct conflict in
this regard..
Furthermore, allowing companies to pay the F-1 Nonimmigrant Students less than the minimum wage, together with excluding
the employer obligation of paying Social Security Taxes is unwise and detrimental to our entire system of government. 
This proposal would only encourage corporate greed and has no other benefit or logical purpose.
