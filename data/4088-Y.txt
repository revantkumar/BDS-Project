Cathy Street Is it not the responsiblity of the President of the United State to have the American people's best interest, before foreigners interest. We, the American people are having a hard enough time making ends meet, trying to find jobs. Where is your loyality?, should it not be first and foremost to the American people. It's would be great to help others in need, but lets first get are own house in order. Job's for American's first, then help others. Also, if they are working an earning money, they should pay taxes. NO!!! TAKING JOBS FROM AMERICANS!
