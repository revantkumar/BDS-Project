I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:
First, diversity is a very important culture tradition for US. Most of these famous politicians , scientists , engineers and businessmen are immigrants from every part of the world. Their names exit on every page of US history.
Second, competition does exist , but it is not a bad thing. Most STEM international students are qualified and skilled engineers which are badly needed in every country. They can contribute much more values than their salaries and has always been a solid support for the US economy thriving .
