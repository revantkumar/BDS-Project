OPT Extension cannot be cancelled!!!

Currently hundreds of thousands international students are working in OPT or OPT Extension status. Most of them are working in high-tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Linkedin and so forth. They are the most productive employees inside companies. If OPT Extension got cancelled, not only these international students lose the jobs immediately, but also hundreds of thousands American companies will be affected. Some companies might even bankrupt, because they can hardly find appropriate people to take the existing work.

US economy is the most important thing now!!!
