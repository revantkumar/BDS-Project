I feel the government has illegally tampered with the seniors Social Security without
much thought. Now they want to not be fair to our legal young people by giving their
jobs to outsiders. Our country is highest for cost for college and now you want to take
away the opportunities for the young people to help their parents with providing for
themselves some money by working but instead the government wants to punish the younger
generation for some ungodly reason. Congress needs to man up and do the correct thing
for the generation that needs to work to even get through college. I have worked for
45 years and now have to worry about my Social Security not being there for me. I'm
tired of the government taking advantage of those of us who were born here legally. Stop this ridiculous regulation and be a government for the people. Why do We the 
people have to tell you what you should already know. I feel that if I'm expected to
follow the laws then so should the government have to follow the laws and Constitution!!
