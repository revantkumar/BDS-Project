It is very important and helpful for international student to continue education after graduation. People has to way more harder than others as an international student to get an opportunity here. If is too unfair for them to continues working. Some people just become familiar with new working circumstance, and work super hard. But they have to face quiting their job.. This is not what employer or employee want. If so, none will be dare to hire any international employee anymore!
