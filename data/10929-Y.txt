I was glad to see the proposed rule for re-instituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.

Firstly, as you know, a lot of the international students are very excellent engineers. In our high school, only the best students might have the opportunities to study abroad. They are young and energetic, they are innovative and hardworking, they are eager to learn new technologies, and learn quickly. Expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees, which will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, and further fuel the U.S. economy.

Secondly, the U.S. is the frontier of the high-tech technologies. There are a number of famous companies in the U.S., such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. The proposal to re-institute the STEM extension will provide international students a very valuable hands-on experience in these famous companies, which is really exciting and also the main reason that more and more international students would like to pursue a Bachelor/Master/Ph.D. degree in U.S., which further promotes the economic development of the U.S. by investing a lot of money on the tuition, housing, and living.

Therefore, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.
