Positive step towards globalization as technology plays important part in our lives now. Letting students explore their fields of study and giving much needed time to master the skills learned in school is really necessary. This will also keep the competition alive globally for international students wanting to earn a degree in STEM particularly. Technology is the solution to major economic and social challenges and all individuals studying technology should be given the opportunity to learn and practice it irrespective of their nationality. This also gives students a reason to stay in the country legally and contribute to the local and national economy.
