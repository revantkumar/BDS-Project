Diana Brown International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership and quantitative skills. Raytheon Chairman and CEO William Swanson said at a Massachusetts' STEM Summit last fall, "Too many students and adults are training for jobs in which labor surpluses exist and demand is low, while high-demand jobs, particularly those in STEM fields, go unfilled.". Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century. If intelligent International students with STEM degrees are allow ed to work more, they would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as the technology development.
