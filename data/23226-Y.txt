The economic is benefit from develoment not limitation. 1800s Britain thinked they are in golden age. All things were developed already. Right now, Ameirican people think they are in the top of the universe and there is no space to develop our lives and society. Is it true? Off course not !!
We are still developing and we are still need new blood. Without technological labor, we could have so much development recently years. Technology maintains us as the strongest country to the world. We develop pc, hardware and internet that will make every kind of work high efficiency. We are on a fast ride. But right now, people think international labor are robbed our good life. Is that the same these people believe our economic is limited and not developed ? 

The spring water will bloom every place it passed by. Died water will dry at the end. I believe our technological industry just like spring water making us blooming and making a better society. International students are not only ones benefit from these. If this policy will support our technology well and benefit every American in the end. Why do we say no ?

What will you select? Block international students just like block our technological industry in the died water. It is true that american employee will benefit at the beginning. what is end ? It will be stink and poison. Our development will slow down due to we will lose great labors. Our hire cost will be increase due to the labor provide is decreased. Our companies will meet difficulties due to the higher cost and slow technology support. Yes , we make the whole industry in the died water.
