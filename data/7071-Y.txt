Already students have started to go to ENGLAND because of the OPT extension is stopped by the court in US and there the education is less expensive for Masters, since it is one year only and lot of employment opportunities.
America will be the loser for each Masters seat evolving around $125000 per year as college fees. If there are no students for Masters Stem, there will be a loss of $ 31250000000 per year to USA with 250000 proposed foreign students. Total Loss to US Colleges and Universities in 10 year will be
$312500000000!
If the stem extension is not continued around 70000 students have to leave the country by 16 Feb 2016 and their projects/work will be halted, because of no skilled worker is available and it will affect employers/Industry for $70000000000 worth of projects/works/research and other revenues to US for 1 year till 16 Feb 2017
Most of the students paid University non resident tuition and other fees to US Government at a very high rate and if this opt extension is not there, IT IS A GUARANTEE THAT NO FOREIGN STUDENT WILL COME TO STUDY IN US.
All the current students will go back to their country with the knowledge they gained by their education and US will be losing their talent and skills.
