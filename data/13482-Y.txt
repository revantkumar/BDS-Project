This new proposed rule is a great improvement to streamline the immigration system for legal and law-abiding students/resident aliens, which will benefit both US academia and industry. First, the enhanced post-graduate training benefits for F1 visa holders will help American Universities to attract the needed capital and top talents from all over the world and retain their leading positions. This will benefit local/American students by providing them with a multi-cultural study environment, even better academic resources and financial aid opportunities. Second, this new rule will help STEM graduate students better focus on their jobs/functionalities in critical positions where there is a labor shortage of qualified local/American students. The reality is American companies are very unwilling (as they should be) to hire foreign students unless they absolutely have to, because of the complicated procedure and high cost. If a STEM student without a long-term stay promise (OPT is temporary) is hired for a position, it is more than likely a position where there are not many qualified American students available in that specific area. Filling this type of positions can make US economy stronger and create more jobs for American students who are qualified in other areas. 

In all, I hope this new rule will take effect as soon as possible to benefit US universities, US workers and US economy.
