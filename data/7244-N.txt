When we have so many unemployed and under-employed American citizens, why would anyone think this is a good idea. It is far past time to start thinking of America and it's citizens FIRST. I work in the tech industry and my employer is slowly but surely replacing us with H1B Visa workers. I advised my children to NOT pursue a degree in any of the STEM fields as they would have to compete with too many foreign students for jobs. There is a total disdain for American citizens by our current administration. On top of the losses to American citizens in terms of jobs, there's also the economic loss to the economy. At a time when deficits are so high and our national debt unpayable, we must put American citizens to work. American citizens will spend most every dime in this country thus providing a stimulus for economic growth. Monies that leave this country because of foreign workers will never benefit the economy via the basic economic principal of the 'multiplier effect'. The OPT program is not good for America or American citizen workers. This program is/will be abused to provide an avenue to a long term work visa and eventually a green card. This is WRONG and BAD for America.
