STOP BRINGING IN FOREIGN STUDENTS TO WORK IN U.S. JOBS. IF THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS AS SOME WOULD HAVE US BELEIVE. THEN LETS EDUCATE US CITIZENS TO DO THE JOB. WE DONT NEED TO KEEP BRINGING PEOPLE HERE TO PAY THEM A LOWER WAGE AND TAKE AWAY GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR CITIZENS. YOU ARE NOT FOOLING ANYONE NO MATTER WHAT WAY YOU PAINT IT.
