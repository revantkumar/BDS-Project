The question is "Why are you flooding this country with foreign students i.e. foreigners?" and always making it harder and harder for U.S. students/graduates to find work, get jobs. Students and their families pour thousands and thousands of dollars (much of it borrowed and needed to pay back) into college and university training thinking it will guarantee them solid employment when oftentimes it does not. The competition is already fierce and your policies make it impossible. 
Also why encourage top notch foreign students to come here when they are needed in their own home countries. It all seems to flow from the idea that transforming America is a good thing. America was a good place and it is becoming a microcosm of the world. Is that a good thing? Does anyone recognize America anymore?
First, let's give Americans, including our own young people, the jobs that they have been trained for and in the country to which they know and are loyal.
