I seriously can't think of any disadvantages of extension.
There aren't any hordes of unemployed STEM educated Americans who are kept out of a job due to the extension. 
The international students are treated lessen than the illegals in this country. These people goes through so much struggle and competition to get till here and people cannot even stand them working for two and half years after spending thousands of dollars for their degree. I would suggest the government to focus on the illegals rather than the students.
