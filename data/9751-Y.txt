As previous years result shows, skilled immigrants have made huge contributions in the innovation and ground breaking research. It opens the door for more jobs, opportunities and helps in strengthening economy. 

It is my firm belief that immigrants of the superior technology in America need to be given more time and benefit to help build the foundation for a culturally diverse, fundamentally strong economy that will help everyone live better lives. With a 24 month extension on the OPT, the skilled workforce has enough motivation and time to create something that could potentially change the world.
