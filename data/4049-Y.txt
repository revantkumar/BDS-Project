Jack Fen I support this rule.

1.The new bill could increase state tax revenue and stimulate economic since students who stay at the United States belong to the high-income group, living their lives will stimulate economic growth to some extent.

2.Companies can hire more highly skilled people easily. Students who study abroad belong to the elite group since they have already got a lot of exercise no matter from the perspective of the individual working ability or from the perspective of psychological Quality.

3.The rules also comply with immigration policies which the US government has always advocated. Generations of immigrants struggle and help to build the country , there is no current prosperity of the United States if there is no immigrants. The rule will help to select highly skilled people and motivate the people to learn tech.
