OPT extension is not just very important for International students, it is also very important for American development. Currently the OPT is only 12 months. For many outstanding international students, they only have one chance to get the H1B working visa. if they don't, they will be sent out of USA immediately. And now, the fact is that, the chance of getting H1B for a collage graduate is only about 1/3, and only 2/3 for a graduate student!!! This means, each year, there are about 1/2 great talents, who could have contribute to the USA development so much, because they don't get the H1B visa, would have no choice but leave USA. If we could extend the OPT for 24 more months, international students would have 2 more chance for getting H1B. On one hand, the possibility for them to get H1B is bigger, on the other hand, the fact that they could at least working in the USA for 2 more years would have a great contribution to the US economy.
