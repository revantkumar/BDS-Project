New stem opt rule should be implemented as it helps international students and skilled immigrants. From so many years skilled immigrants and stem opt students made huge contribution to the usa economy and played its part in making usa the best country in the world. In new stem opt, giving extra 7 months will be good for the international students and cap gap, but there are some changes to be made in the proposed rule ,that asks the employee,employer,DSO, Client location manager to fill the form. This is a huge and time taking process. Atleast we should allow the form submission without client manager filling up the form, which will reduce the process time.
