STEM extension is extremely fair and important for all of the Americans and international students. Americans would not be affected by the small quote of international students' competition but would be benefited by the endless improvements of social competition against the whole world. We do not occupy the the united state and we are harmless group of people, and we spend thousand of thousands dollars in the tuition portion. To make the whole game fair, I suggest to extend the STEM as well. This would be a wise decision to extent the STEM, for it would benefit both the educational budget and the improvement of social competition of united states
