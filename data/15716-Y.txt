I strongly believe that students on F-1 nonimmigrant student visa should be allowed to do an OPT for at least 3 years, if not longer. It is vital to allow these students to get practical experience after getting their degrees and can be beneficial for both USA and the students.

The 24 month extension is vital to ensure that these students get sufficient time to learn and practise their knowledge in a real world setting after their degrees, specially since a lot of these opportunities might not be available in their home country. This would also allow the US to remain competitive with regards to university education, talent pool and job market.
