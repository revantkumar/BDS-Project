I agree to extend STEM OPT to 24 months. A lot of employers have found it hard to fulfill needs within the US citizen and OPT student is a good way to hire short term labor. It's like a long intern so that employer has the full benefits enjoy the full benefits before deciding whether to go for long term employments. Also due to the H1B cap, OPT students are not able to stay longer if not finding other legal identities. OPT students pay the same taxes as everyone else and due to the nature of the STEM work, they are paying a lot of taxes than average and contribute to US government funding. We should support these students to get a little more experience for their education and let them do a little more contribution to the country.
