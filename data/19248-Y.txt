As a significant member in a cutting-edge biology group, I strongly agree with this proposal.
After reading the details of the proposal, I think it would be beneficial for US technology companies, academic institutes, R&D development of the pharmaceutical and biology fields. I'm stating my opinions from my own experience as following:

I am holding F1(OPT-extension) visa. I have backgrounds of biological science, so I would like to use "literature reference" as my first and the most strong support. Just by searching any key words in any field of biology in Pubmed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), it is very obvious to find how many international students and scholars are contributing to and pushing the whole area forward during their stay in US.
As a member in a competitive research group in Boston,MA., it took me 1/5 of time as for other new staff to learn and complete trainings, needless to say, I finish much more workloads compared to my fellow co-workers in my 40 hours work every week. That's my personal experience, and I do feel I learnt so much in a group full of smart people. My group has always been the "Trailblaze" in the field. And I am sincerely appreciating the OPT opportunities here.

As every other significant proposals would have criticisms, there are negative voices as well. People say it is JUST like other "generous" policies leading to illegal immigration. I'm truly sorry to see the situation is becoming an issue here, but what percentage of international students are among illegal immigrants? Why would a well-educated, hard-working person gives everything up in their motherland and becomes a illegal alien here??

US is providing opportunities for international students and as well gaining great fortunate because of this, therefore, lengthening OPT extension is going to tighten the bonds and mutually beneficial for each other.
