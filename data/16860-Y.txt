It seems a little absurd to me to think that international students in STEM subjects could actually poach jobs away from Americans who WANT to work in the same fields. 

First, you have to know that STEM extension of OPT is all about entry-level jobs for fresh graduates. Firms go to schools to hire. The more technical the job is, the more education of the candidate it requires. In the field that I'm studying right now, many hiring firms only want master's and PhD students. As far as I know, many of the graduate students (master's + PhD) in STEM majors in my school (a math institute) are international students. My class has around 30 people this year, only 2 of them are native (this situation is not unusual at all for programs like mine). Guess what, our past placement stats show that jobs come usually easier for citizens. But that doesn't mean American students alone could suffice. The job market simply has the demand, and these are all highly technical jobs that require the best of the best. 

Second, even if foreign students get a job offer right after graduation and work on their OPTs, they still face a very high chance of not getting H1-B eventually. The job market has its own filtering process; those who are capable get the jobs eventually. The goal of having the STEM extension is exactly that: let the job market choose the best talents--in a reasonable time frame.

Ultimately, it is these talents, native or foreign, that drive America's innovations, which in turn may very well change your life in a way that you could have never imagined.

Finally, I think there are reasons why American firms (and American culture in general) dominate today's business world. But impeding competition or diversification is never one of them.
