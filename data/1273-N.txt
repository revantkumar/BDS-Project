Let me see if I understand this. Our government wants to train foreign workers instead of our own? Why would we do that? Who is benefiting? Not the American taxpayer? This is a joke. You are supposed to work for the AMERICAN PEOPLE not foreign governments. I want American students trained. Enough of this under the table collusion with big business and government. You want cheap labour lower the corporate tax rate and business will come back to the U.S. If you government workers don't like America then go live in these foreign countries that you feel so beholden to train their people. Ii have had enough of this garbage.
