I strongly support OPT extension.

This proposal benefits American universities, American society, American people and STEM students. I read a lot of news and talks about some great managers or CEO from Technology Company almost went back to their own country because of VISA problem or they are not American citizens.

If no OPT extension, some genius will have two choices, go back to their own country or to do a postdoc or some positions in the academic area. Either of them are a waste. We want to keep them in the area they are good at. 

Thank you for this proposal and your time for consideration!
