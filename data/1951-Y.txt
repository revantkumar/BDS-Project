I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the reason that the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
Most STEM students graduate from best universities in U.S. They acquired rich knowledge in their major in university, and they work for big companies in U.S, and contributes to the increase of U.S. economy. These students are talents, and talents are the most important to a country's future development. Therefore, the government should make effort to keep them staying in U.S and make more contributions to U.S.
