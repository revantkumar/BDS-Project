Fang Liu I strongly SUPPORT the new 24 months STEM OPT extension. Myself is a postdoctoral researcher in a STEM field. From my experiences the US STEM grads are definitely NOT enough for the current STEM jobs, especially the new emerging fields such as data science or computer science. Last year the US grads from our department have 3-4 job offers and they have to decline some of them.
Hiring international STEM students will with no doubt bring about huge amount of human capital to keep up with the fast developing economy. We are planning to bring manufacturing industry back home to US, in which design and implementation will need lot of STEM graduates. I strongly agree that we will have to give them enough time to make their own contributions to our economy.
