I highly recommend the government to support this policy based on the following reasons:
1. The happy life that Americans are leading now is definitely from the foreign students' contribution. Without talented foreign people, without this powerful and developed America.
2. As a country that always regards freedom as the fundamental spirit, America should show its equity for all students and welcome all the talented foreign students to America, which is the source that make this country as a leader of the world.
3. Those who claim foreign students take away their job opportunities should aware that it is not foreign students take away your jobs, but your weak abilities make you lose your jobs. One has to compete with other so that he can improve himself, the same to the country. So prevent foreign talented people from working or studying in US is totally a wrong policy to protect this country.
