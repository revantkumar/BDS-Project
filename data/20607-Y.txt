I have seen some people mentioned that expansion of OPT will threaten local Americans' job opportunities. However, I don't believe it is true because most job openings related to STEM programs which are very technical and quantitative. Those who have difficulties in finding jobs usually don't want this type of jobs. It comes to my notice that talents of data analytics skills or other technical skills are always in high demand by US companies. There is a desperate demand there which is still poorly fed now. Looking at those job hunt websites any time, I can easily find developers or programmers are always needed. If internationals students with the desired capabilities are allowed to stay longer, it will somehow relieve such shortage of technology talents. At the end of day, demand and supply will always reach an equilibrium. The fewer constraints are set, the better equilibrium there will be.
