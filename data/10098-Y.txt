I strongly agree to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. It is a must for students to get some hands on experience after graduation, and apply the knowledge mastered in school to the practical. This will help the economics of US and will also make more people willing to study in US.
