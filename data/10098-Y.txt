Joan Sanderson International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. This will ensure continuous supply of young talented STEM graduates and promote growth of science and technology. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Many jobs are going unfilled simply for lack of people with the right skill sets.
