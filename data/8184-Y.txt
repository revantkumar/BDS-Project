I am very disappointed in this proposal. It sounds as though it is such a wonderful program. After reading the opinion of experts who are more informed than myself, I see big advantages for the foreign students and very little for our American students. Mentoring foreign students for 3 years after they earn a Masters degree before they return home is an easily recognized deterrent for American students that don't get the same benefits. Where is the support for our STEM students to get mentorship to enter the marketplace. Charity begins at home. Our country needs qualified, well trained STEM workers. If ware not producing enough, then upgrade our education system. Of course if it is good enough to train the foreign students, it should be good enough to turn out American student who can benefit from this program as well. In other words, I do not support this proposed rule by Homeland Security.
