I strongly support this proposal. I am a green card holder. And I have worked with many intelligent international students, who made extreme contribution to the technology development. Losing them for sure will be a detriment to US technology and economics.

I have also talked with my friend, a experienced recruiter in High-Tech, who said actually with the same capability, US citizens definitely will find much better jobs than foreign students. For the employers, they are always hesitant to hire foreigners due to the fees to support H1B. It is only when they cannot find appropriate US citizen candidate, they resort to foreign talents, which at least help them maintain the normal operation of their companies. 

Actually, it is fortunate that US has the advantage to attract the world elites to work for the States, so that US can stay No. 1 in the world. The world is flat; repelling international talents will not create more position for US citizens, but more outsourcing projects to India and China. This is nothing other than handing the sword to the competitors.
