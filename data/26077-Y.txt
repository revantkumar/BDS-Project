I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
If the opt extension no longer available, international STEM students will have no enough time to get a job and practice their skills well in America before they go back to their home countries. So how can American Universities attract foreign STEM talents? Also how can lots of the high-tech companies attract foreign talents, who are the mainstays for some of those companies, and keep persistent international competitive?
