As a formal student and already graduated 5 years, I have to tell those people who complain about international students took American students' job something, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

In my company, I talked to our HR, all of them told me if two candidates, one is international student and the other is American, both of them have same technique background, they prefer to hire Americans more. But why there are still many international students in IT companies? Because they have no way to find enough American students! There are tons of job opportunities in bay area every day, you can say it's easy to find a job due to the large amount of openings, however, you can also say it's difficult, because all the high tech stuff is not easy to learn, and even harder to become an expert. People please stop complaining that, if every student can put more energy in their study, and do better in exams and projects, how come they can not find a job???

And as I know, not every company has the right to extend OPT for F1 students, there is a program named E-verify. Government will check that if the company really need those F1 students or not and decide to give them E-verify or not. So guys, stop blaming others, open your text book and you will definitely find a good stem job, and it's way easier for you other than international students.
