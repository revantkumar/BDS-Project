Sue Martin International students are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining. Americans who engaged with international students while on campus are more likely in later life to appreciate art and literature, place current problems in historical perspective and read or speak a foreign language as per survey from duke university. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide STEM graduates with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
