Some People who oppose OPT STEM Extension proposal states that new international graduates do not need any practical training and are ready to work in industry. This statement is unfounded. I bet people who support these statements have never been to college and majored in STEM majors. 

There is always a big gap between academic research/study and industrial work. New graduates from STEM majors generally knows a little bit of everything in their discipline. The courses they took teach them the upper-level idea of how things work, and the projects they have done in university are simple and of small scales. When I was a student in Electrical Engineering, I was once assigned a project of designing a processor which can execute simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, small functions, etc. Though I learned the basic structure of the processor and successfully designed my own little processor, what I gained from this project is really limited and just scratches the surface of processor design. For example, the processor I designed only consists of thousands of logic gates. In real industry, the commercial processors consist of billions of logic gates. There are so much more for new graduates in STEM major to learn from industry to build a solid background, and be prepared for their career life. Giving the complexity of the work they are going to get involved in the future, one years OPT is not enough, and OPT STEM Extension is necessary for international students to REALLY understand what they have learned in university.

Without OPT STEM Extension, studying in the US will become a less and less appealing choice for international students. Who want to pay so much tuition money abroad to learn some purely theoretical stuff?
