I support this proposal. Please give a freewill the chance to choose his best career starting point. Some international students have been hurt a lot for the broken immigration system. They have been struggling in short OPT, H1B lottery and unbelievable long waiting time to be a citizen LEGALLY. Some of them are standing at an edge to be able to serve a great country, or have to be back to work for a regime against America and then ruin his whole life.
