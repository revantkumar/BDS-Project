Steve Williams As a US citizen, I strongly support the rule. 
To maintain our preeminence in science and technology, we need more qualified workforce to compete with the world. This has always been the case, this country is built on highly qualified people participating from all over the world participating in our economy. Be it the players, artists and in this case students. It makes no sense to let these students go without due contribution to our economy. 

In my experience I have not seen a company hire an international student over a US citizen. It is always risky to hire foreign nationals because they cannot commit long term. Even three years of training is not going to change that, but it will give these students enough time to practice in the field of their learning. 

Thanks.
