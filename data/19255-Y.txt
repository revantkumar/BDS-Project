This is a good initiative by the USCIS. A lot of foreign students perform really well in their professions. U.S.A is a land of diversities and hence open to accept people of all the countries to pursue higher education here in the U.S and work here. If this rule isn't passed, most of the immigrants would hesitate to come here for their studies. This would hinder the growth of the economy of U.S too. So, I strongly support the proposal of extension of the stem OPT period.
