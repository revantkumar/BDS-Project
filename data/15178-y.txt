Anonymous I fully support the proposed rule.

America is a nation which is proud of being open to different ethnicities, Talented STEM students would definitely make the american economy better, this has been proven in the past. Implementing this rule is a win - win situation for both the STEM Students and USA. 

STEM Students come here legally, work hard to find jobs and also pay their taxes like any other american citizen. If the DHS really wants to fix something they should consider the H1 and L1 program that are being monopolized by Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and Tech Mahindra.

American citizens and green card holders always have the first preference for any job i have see so far, providing that they are talented enough for it. It would be disastrous if this program is removed as a lot of highly qualified workers will fall out of status. I believe that implementing this rule is very important for the american economy.

Please go easy on the STEM Students.
