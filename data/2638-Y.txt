Linlin Zhu I STRONGLY support this rule not only on behalf of the international students but also for the US citizens.
It is true that international student benefit a lot from OPT STEM, however it is the us academic institutes who obtain the most benefit from this rule. As referenced above, DHS is taking this action to include a STEM OPT extension as part of the OPT program under the F-1 nonimmigrant classification in order to better ensure, among other important national interests, that the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally. And this is the reason why foreign students take USA as the priority country to choose when pursuing higher education. Also countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are realizing the importance of attracting outstanding foreign students and actions have been taken by them.
Also DHS recognizes that this rule should be addressed quickly because of the imminent vacatur of the 2008 IFR, and the significant uncertainty surrounding the status of thousands of students in the United States. Some of the students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the United States. DHS must therefore act swiftly to mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the 2008 IFR. Revoking this rule means kicking those students back to their countries without human rights with the skills obtained from US and work for US potential competitors in the future (e.g. China).
International students are not the ones who rob the opportunities from US citizens. The truth is that international students are learning the majors which US citizens are not willing to learn, especially for STEM majors. If you look around the labs or the classrooms for EE and CE, you'll barely see more than ten locals there.
