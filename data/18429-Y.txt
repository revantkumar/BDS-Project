I think it is shortsighted and against the interest of Americans to refuse international students right to work in the U.S after graduation because they are not U.S citizens. One of the biggest concern of U.S citizens are the internationals are stealing our jobs which is not the case, the Department of Homeland Security has a safeguards for U.S worker in related field, that does not allow any company to lay off, terminate or furlough any full time or part time U.S workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to international students. There is no such thing as stealing our jobs because it is not comparable. Almost all companies are required to have equal opportunity for employment, in fact, many multi-national companies (such as Johnson and Johnson, Procter and Gamble) has even stated in their job listing that only U.S citizens are considered about job positions in the U.S, excluding all international STEM students. 

OPT also has allowed U.S universities and colleges to retain its attraction to international students, we are all aware that the huge tuition difference between an international student and a in-state student. Allowing international students to be able to work in the US is a very practical attraction for students considering to attend any U.S universities. This no doubt will increase the economy growth and help more universities to do a better job helping U.S students since tuition are used equally on all students.
