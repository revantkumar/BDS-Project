I am an international STEM student in my last month of the 12-month OPT program. I graduated from a US university with a PhD degree. The research team that I work for consists mostly of international scholars because it is extremely difficult to find a US citizen in the exact field of research with similar caliber. In fact, we once tried really hard to hire a US citizen researcher to work on a US government related project. The position stayed open for 8 months, during which time, we worked with very experience recruiters and did tons of advertising for this job. However, we couldn't find any candidate that could pass the interviews. And eventually, the position had to be closed.
If the OPT extension program were scraped, several researchers in our team will be affected. It would take the company at least a year to find replacement for us. We are working on cutting edge technology that could transform the US healthcare system. The interruption in the research work will affect the revolution of the US healthcare billing systems and will eventually affect the quality of life for millions of Americans.
