I totally agree to extending the OPT for F-1 Nonimmigrant STEM students because keeping these talented and hardworking engineers will keep us stay competitive among our countries. These new engineers have proved their value by making our companies more successful. In addition, engineers are needed by our country and extending OPT for STEM students will give our employers more opportunities to find the best engineers to serve our country. Also these engineers also bring more job opportunities. For example, they pay a large amount of fee to our universities, they buy cars and houses, and they also contribute to the tourism industry. Therefore, keeping these STEM students with us will definitely make our country better.
