I am happy that DHS made this move. 

First of all workers with STEM degrees will create a lot job opportunities. According to a report from the Information Technology Industry Council, http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/stem-report.pdf, "Every foreign-born student who graduates from a US university with an advanced degree and stays to work in STEM has been shown to create on average 2.62 jobs for American workers often because they help lead in innovation, research and development." This greatly helps employment for citizens.

In addition, STEM students who are citizens in U.S., for cultural reasons, are much more likely to choose a non-traditional career path. And this trend will continue to be accelerating, which means demand for STEM students will be higher, and it has to be filled by international students. 

From the universities perspective, the STEM major will attract large amount of students. If the OPT or extension rule damages the benefits of nonimmigrant students, there could be a severe decline in international students who want to develop a career in U.S. Further, IT companies don't have enough workforce and eventually hurt the economy. 

I strongly hope that this proposed rule will be finalized and certainly it will benefit universities, companies, the STEM industry market and U.S. economy.
