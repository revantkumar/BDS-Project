Shine Supporters I strongly SUPPORT the STEM extensions, considering following aspects. 
1. Though education is not a business, but our international students do bring more business opportunities to the country. As international students, we are legally TAX PAYERS and very discipline. During the time we live in US, the living cost mainly goes to the US CITIZENS. "For the 2013-2014 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs" - See more at: http://immigrationimpact.com/2014/11/19/international-students-add-billions-u-s-economy/#sthash.bn06IK7p.dpuf 

2.Since we pay higher tuition, the institutes have more funds to improve their facilities and provide more professional services to ALL the students. Don't forget about the multicultural environment featured by collision and merge of different culture is an important index when evaluate the quality of the education of one institute.

3.This policy gives the US education an edge in attracting high quality students from other countries. As a recently enrolled STEM student, I choose to cross over the sea and indulge into the 2-year master degree in statistics( forget about the time spent or the distance from my families, the cost is quite high), not only for the university provides me a good opportunity to gain more insights in academic field but also for the chance to develop my career skills in actual industries. When I back to my country, a 12-month time working as trainee in certain foreign company is not convincing enough to have expertise in that work. Furthermore, there are other countries provide good education but without a professional training period,like UK\Singapore\Japan, if I intend to have better chance when back to my homeland, they would be better choice, when considering the distance and total cost.
