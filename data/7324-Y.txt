I strongly support the OPT extension ! It brings a lot of benefits to US citizens.As we can see,many outstanding people who make great contributions to Amercian society are from foreign countries.The diversity of the population can make a sound atmosphere of competition,and also give chances for all the citizens to learn from people from different countries.This promotes the progress of the society!
