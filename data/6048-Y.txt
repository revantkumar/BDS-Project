I support the extension of OPT.

The United States is a country built by immigrants. Since the nation was born, the country relies on the fresh blood gushing into it to keep the leadership in the world. This is the fundamental that US can grow to be a strong country. However, many people seem to forget how their country becomes a giant. I understand they love our country, but they don't know how.

We should encourage highly educated people to work in the US as other countries do. The competition among the countries are no longer military, population, or even economy. It is talents that are real treasure. I admire US has the generosity to accept illegal immigrants from Mexico who are mostly blue-collars, yet we are still narrow-minded in embracing highly educated immigrants. I don't understand why those opponents are so afraid of the OPT students. Yeah, they may lose jobs due to the competition of the foreigners, but they never see how many jobs these students created after 10 years. If you look at the CEOs of the major IT companies, you will find many Indian people, without which Google or Microsoft may have already gone broken up.

On the other side, if the OPTs student did not have extension, and are forced to go back to their own countries, they will bring our technology to their own countries, and run their startups, copy our ideas and compete with our companies. Once our companies are purchased by other companies, our economy goes down, then those pathetic short-sighted people will find harder to find jobs, because there is no more opportunities for them.

I would suggest the DHS not only extend the OPT, but also give green cards to foreign PhD students. We can limit low level immigrants but we should welcome high level immigrants
