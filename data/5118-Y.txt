The improvement is very critical to all the STEM degree students and also the United States. Think about this, if this new improvement failed, then all then nonimmigrant students only have one years to get a job and stay at the States. But the problem is, most company won't hire people who can only work here for one year. So which mean most of these students can't even find a job and they will leave and may never come back again. That is not a problem if United States have a great number of people can full fill these STEM related position. However, even under current circumstance, the problem is, there are a great number of STEM related job opening on the market and cannot find the right people to fit their position. 

Taking about why we need 24 months, instead of 17 months. The 7 months different will be a great improvement for those who company whose want to know more about their employee performance and their potential as well. It's a double wins for them.
