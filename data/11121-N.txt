In light of the number of unemployed American citizens unable to find suitable work, I oppose the proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security. Proposing an expansion of the Optional Practical Training Program borders on being a preposterous move. 
Employers would have a decidedly advantageous incentive to hire foreign students instead of qualified Americans by not having to pay their payroll taxes equivalent to almost 8% of the employees pay for up to 3 years instead of the current one year. 
It does not make sense, especially at this time when recent college graduates cannot find suitable work, to give companies incentive to hire foreign citizens over U. S. citizens.
