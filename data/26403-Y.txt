Each STEM student coming into United States spends atleast 30k dollars for education which does not include the living expenses. After having completed the Degree, it makes all the sense for him to stay here and get some practical industrial training from the Companies which have relevant work. In the process, not only is the student gaining good experience which is very difficult to get in their home country, but it also benefits the employers since the student is dedicating his time and intellect to help companies achieve the goal of the company. 12 months of OPT period is not very adequate since in most cases, depending on the nature of the job these 12 months might actually end up in only probationary training, not exactly helping the development of student extensively. I strongly approve this decision of DHS to provide extended OPT period for the STEM students to 24 more months. It will definitely help in the economy of The U.S because all these students will be paying all the legal taxes to boost the economy. It will also help the companies evaluate these students during this period and take legal measures to retain them within the country as there is a dearth of people with these skill sets within the country, Not approving this will create a fundamental demand & supply problem within the tech industry which might severely affect the economy of the company.
