Strongly support the extension. If every international student with STEM Degree works for one year and leave, it won't help company to grow but only waste time in hiring international student. However, native student alone obviously cannot fill up the demand. Also, if less opportunity for training after graduation in US, there might be less people come to US for degree. This would also be a loss for educational system. Extension OPT is the good way to avoid damage on both Industry and Education system.
