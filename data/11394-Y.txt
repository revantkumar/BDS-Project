I support expanding training opportunities for eligible F-1 students. I worked at the Ohio State University as a researcher in the past 3 years. I witnessed several excellent international students who graduated from my lab forced to left American companies after two years without a valid H1B visa. 24 months OPT will give them one more chance to gain the H1B visa. The international students with a STEM degree generally are the people with very good education background and expertise in certain area. They usually hardworking and make a lot of contributions to the American society.
