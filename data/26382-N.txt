This is America. We have many unemployed, from veterans to college students a s summer job seekers. I have no idea how America changed from a Christian country taking care of our own to a Muslim illegal alien supporting bank. It has to stop. If someone wants to enter this country and following the existing laws to become a citizen of americaloyal to our constitution and laws they are entitled to all rights provided to citizens fine. But to offer training and jobs to non citizens is criminal and those proposing it should be tried for treason.
