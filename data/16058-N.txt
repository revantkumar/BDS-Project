Why is it that this government is so ANTI-AMERICAN? Why does it work so hard to provide for those who come from foreign countries instead of working to make sure that AMERICAN students and AMERICAN workers benefit from work programs?
With millions of Americans on the dole, looking for work, and suffering, is it not time for this government to STOP defeating their dreams of employment. 

Common sense and common decency REQUIRE this government to stop giving away jobs to other than American citizens.

When there is FULL employment (and not via the skewed government numbers), THEN you can think about allowing more workers to obtain jobs. I am sickened by the hypocrisy of this administration and its purposeful attempt to undermine the American worker.
