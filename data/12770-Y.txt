I studied mechanical engineering and mathematics in the 1950's and 1960's. I did not need more time after college to be trained. I was trained fully in my disciplines and I held full time, full work load jobs at a full salary. No intern period was required then for technical degreed people nor is it now. That is the nature of technical degrees in engineering and mathematics. It is also the case in most other sciences such as chemistry, biology, and physics. The only benefit from being able to hire foreign personnel is for large corporate structures to save money and for President Obama, the despot, to deliver on his promise to ruin the United States by putting American engineers on bread lines.
No engineering student requires any time in training after she or he has secured a degree. This whole process is useless and is designed to allow big business and big government to screw Americans, again. Once the foreign person has secured his/her degree in the United States, send them home to pursue their careers. The USA has enough qualified engineers to fill any openings in any discipline any where in the country. And if that ever is not the case, then more US citizens will enter scientific and engineering colleges and universities to take advantage of the jobs available. It has always been thus.
