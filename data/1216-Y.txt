I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

I've read some of the comments for the opponents. Some people said they have young children who could not find a job. However their children are too young to get a Bachelor degree like 18 years old. I would say this proposal is for international students whom have specialty. It's not conflict to their benefits. 

Some people mentioned they got their degree 50 or 60 years ago who do not need any training after graduation. I would say the job market now is very different from that time. It's harder and harder to find a job that we can fit in and we like to work with. 

The truth is, there are a lot jobs that employers only accept American citizens. They say they won't provide sponsorship, That means international student who work in that company finally will go home after training. What I've seen is international students still applied that jobs. Because, what they need is better training. They stay in the U.S. to make themselves better people, other than to compete with American.
