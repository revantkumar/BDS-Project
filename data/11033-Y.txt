OPT extension not only aligns with America's national interest, but also benefits ordinary people's life. It is a great policy to attract excellent talents who can contribute to the country. Foreign students who are eligible for OPT are people who received advanced degree. They have been working every hard to get accepted by universities in the U.S. and received rigorous training in their fields of study. After graduation, they want to leverage their skill sets and knowledge base to contribute to this country by working here. There is NO reason that US should reject them. Specifically, students in STEM majors have the skills this country needs. Their work and minds can help innovation in the arena of science and technology. If we look at America's history, we could find that this country was built upon immigrants, and the growth of this country was achieved by millions of people who came here from different corner of the world. To foreign students, OPT extension is the starting point of American dream. In addition, OPT students are paying all kinds of tax while they are working here, bringing great amount of tax income to the government which could be used to provide social benefits to US citizens and improve everybody's quality of life. Also, they are creating more job opportunities by accelerating the process of moving scientific theory to industry. Every country is trying their best to attract talents, how come US is every trying to do the opposite?
