I am glad to hear the propose of this OPT extension rule, and I do support this OPT extension plan for the following reasons:
1. first of all, US industry needs the skills, experiences and knowledge from nonimmigrant students with STEM degree. For the past decades, we can clearly see the great contributions from international students to the US economy booming. More and more F-1 students get their STEM degree in US universities, and it will be a great loss to US economy if we reject these intelligence fortune.
2. The international students will not make the job marketing more competitive. as my own experience, employees tend to hire a US citizen even though one international student is better than this US student. So the international students will find job opportunities only directly related to their majors, which is strictly defined by the OPT rule. The unemployment of some US workers cannot be blame to international students, just as I cannot blame it on my neighbor if I failed my exam. 
3. It is very important to have this OPT extension for F-1 STEM students since the chance to get a HIB visa for the first year is very low. It will cause a lot of loss to employees and us industry if we force the workers to leave US just one year after their graduation. 
4. We will help our competitors if we reject these precious labor with skills and experiences in the most advanced science and engineering areas. It would be very hard for US to maintain its leading role in science and technology without intelligence from all over the world. 
To summary, I strongly support the OPT extension rule, it is not rule to reduce US citizen workers' opportunities, but a rule to help maintain US economy booming and leading role in science and technology.
