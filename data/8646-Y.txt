I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. US is the strongest country because all the smart people help contributing to this country, without these people, how this country is going to remain the best.

2. Everyone is talking about American Dream in this country. As an international student, we already have way less opportunity because of the limitation of visa issue. Now, the period for stem is even cut, what's the meaning the dream. I guess the dream is for those illegally staying. For those who want to stay legally, there is just no way do this. This legislation gives a sign to the world that illeagle staying is the best way to achieve the American Dream 

3. The international students already face different kinds of inequal treatments in this country because of the limitations of visa. I only see this legislation as way to limit U.S to remain the best country because it only tries to deport the smart people, but let those illeaglly ones stay
