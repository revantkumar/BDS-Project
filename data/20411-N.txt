The anger and vehement opposition towards the fate our children's future is beyond words. I struggle to comprehend how our elected officials have no hesitation in the destruction of their own children and grandchildren's futures. We are America and we need to survive and take care of our own first before we can take care of others. Since when did the politicians forget that WE are the say in this country NOT them. We elected them to speak for us and they have not for years now. 

WE MUST NOT ALLOW FOREIGNERS TO DEPLETE OUR RIGHTFUL JOBS. This can easily be regarded as an act of treason to purposefully destroy our country and its future, as this administration and greedy and destructive corporations such as Facebook, Disney, etc. are proposing to do. They must not be allowed to hurt us any further.
