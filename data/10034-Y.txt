I got my master degree this year and start my opt. Now I am working in a university as a biostatistician and joining several research projects. One of the research project just started and will last 2-3 years. If I only have a 12 months OPT time, the continuous research period will be eliminate. It is also hard for school to find a suitable person. And it will take a long time for the new comer to take over the half way projects. And I think I am not a special case. And I think eliminating OPT extension will result in a loss at least in research field.
