I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. International students are making huge contributions to the country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed more than 3 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010. The international students, who get the job position using OPT in STEM field, are mainly the top students in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world.

2. The OPT and OPT extension policy actually attracts the top students from all over the world to come to US and pursuit high education degree. In 2014, international students contribute 27 billion to U.S. for the high education. Without a nice OPT extension policy, fewer top international students will choose to study in U.S. and the research institutes in U.S. will feel more difficult to find qualified students to do the research projects. 

3. The diversity of the society is very important. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices. And the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings.
