The new OPT extension for international STEM student should be supported. This policy benefits not only International students directly, but also the technology industry and US society. Without OPT extension, a lot of US technology companies will lose technical employees. 

I've read a lot of opponent opinions. Some of them say this policy would make US stem student harder to find a job. It might sounds reasonable, but it is not the truth. From my experience, my US classmates have no problem finding a job. Most of them get offers from big companies such as IBM, or big four accounting company. They also get to choose the location they prefer. On the other hand, International student are facing a lot of barriers because a lot of companies do not provide sponsorship. To find a job, they usually spend longer time, and get jobs maybe hundreds mils away. In terms of competition, it was not fair, from the beginning. A lot of companies already do prefer citizen that international students. 

Some of the opponents say that this policy would make companies in favor of hiring foreigners than US citizen, because they ask for lower wage. In my opinion, the flaw of one policy should not be fixed by canceling another policy. Especially this STEM extension policy was intended to provided traning opportunities for international students. 

In terms of hiring, we should appreciated those equal opportuniti company. Companies make sure the candidates are most talented. It is equally that makes US one of the most desired, and vivid place to chase dream for younger generation.
