Charles Bird It's definitely a good idea to extend the OPT.
Many of my Chinese friends have complains about the tuition so I think they are not stealing from us but bringing money to us.
And I have to mention that many of them are really nice people and are working really hard, it's no good to oppose the extension of the OPT.
