OPT extension is a win-win deal. On one hand, US companies can always have fresh blood pumping into all the vessels.These workers are well educated,energetic, innovative and above all low cost. They will help to boost the economic growth and stimulate the total consumption. On the other hand, most of the international student are from developing countries, they can help to build up the connection between US and these countries who have good prospect. US is slowly moving upward during the past few years,it will be a good idea to tie to the "New Engines". Thus I strongly agree with the extension of OPT.
