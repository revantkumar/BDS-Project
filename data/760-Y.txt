I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. Many people in the U.S. who got great achievement actually started their career from an international student who used OPT.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition can help U.S. get better employees and increase the productivity of the firms, thus further enhance the whole economy of U.S. Therefore, it will keep U.S. economy top.
