Xianming Chen I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. As an international student majored in computer science, the most important reason for me to study in US could is that I can attain more valuable industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. 

As a traditional Chinese people, I would return back China eventually.This is written in my Gene, also for my family. But the potential three years' working experience means so much for me when I return back. It can be a different story of my life without it.

At last, I reclaim my opinion about it, strongly supporting it, since it is a double-win thing.
