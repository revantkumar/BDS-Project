I think this OPT extension is very necessary, for some companies to operate smoothly, because there are a lot global business going on between US and the rest of the world.

I once worked for an automotive supplier in Michigan and one of the customers is Toyota. I remembered a time when an engineering change instruction came from Japan, but the engineering director, who is Japanese and usually does the translation work, was out of office. The task was delayed for a whole week, before the program manager in charge realized that I was able to do the translation. I believe the work efficiency could be greatly improved if we have more internationals working in these global companies. Also, these industries often have programs that take 3-5 years. My manager said every year they need to do the training for new employees for 3-6 months to get them fully familiar with the whole program. I believe if the OPT was shortened, a lot of time would be wasted training new people.
