After 6 years hard work, I obtained my PhD in mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech in 2015. I published 6 scientific papers in leading journals. Now I am working as a mechanical design engineer in a semiconductor company in Silicon Valley, where I face new exciting challenges everyday. I am responsible for new product design and develop patents. I feel proud that I can utilize my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems with the best engineering team in the world. 

However, I didn't get H1B this year and my current EAD will expire on Feb 2015. This put my job and my whole life in jeopardy. I feel upset because I don't know if I could stay in the company and to do the work I like. The validity of the EAD card affects me, my company as well as my family. My manager has talked to HR, senior manager as well as attorney to figure out if anything could help. In addition, I don't know how to explain to my parents my current situation because I don't want them to get worried because of me. I sincerely hope that the 24 months OPT-extension will become valid immediately. I firmly believe it will benefits student like me, companies we're working for, and the whole society we're living in. 

FYI. One of my best friends obtained a PhD from University of Michigan, and a MBA from Stanford University. She is one of the smartest people I've known in my life. However, she was forced to leave U.S simply because she was not able to get H1B this year. I hope things like this will never happen again. US should welcome talent people rather than pushing them away.
