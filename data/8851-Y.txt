I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 
International students came to America because of long OPT period. Without the OPT extension, international students will not have to choose America. They can choose other countries like United Kingdom, Austrilia or other countries they like. People come to United States to learn advanced education and gain some work experience during OPT.
Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institute to stay in Canada for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, with no restriction on employment type in 2008. The number of international students by 2014 doubled than 2008. This increase is beause of the new Post-Graduation Wprk Permit Program, as it allows international students to gain valuable work experience.
Many students give up the offers from universities in other countries, and choose a university in US because of the OPT extension. With the extension, the development in STEM area will increase in America, and the economy will also increase due to the increasing number of international students.
So I Strongly support this proposal.
