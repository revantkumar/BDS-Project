United States as the most well developed country deserves high talents, no matter she is a native or foreigner. In today's life, most hardworking people as well as most talented people get jobs. This is not lead by this proposal. 

The STEM proposal gave United States more talents all around the world, direct lead to growth in a lot of fields. It is unfair to look through the whole thing segmentary. Also immigration gave strong support on U.S.'s finance. A lot of immigration bring programs to United States. Instead of making native lose jobs, these people are offering job opportunities.

As the experiences suggest, competition lead to well-operated marked. This is also work on job market. When there is competition, everybody put more efforts on make themselves better. As a results, we got higher quality outputs in every field. These is the reason of high speed and quality of todays United States's economy.

It is not fair to judge a proposal based on personal emotions. I think we should consider more about this country's future.
