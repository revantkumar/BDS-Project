David Grubbs I oppose the DHS proposal that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 

This program creates an incentive for companies to hire foreign students instead of qualified Americans.

It also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree.

The US Labor Participation rate is the highest since the1970s and this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. If President Obama wants to create jobs for Americans, expanding the OPT program isn't the way to do it. 

The expansion allows companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Is this a good idea for America? It isn't.

I strongly oppose the DHS proposal that would expand the Optional Practical Training program.
