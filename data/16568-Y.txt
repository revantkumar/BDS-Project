I strongly approve of this rule. Expanding the OPT is NOT the reason why native American students lose their jobs. They lost their jobs, if they did, because they were not qualified for them. Expanding the OPT gives a chance to the youngsters who have the will and talents to full fill their dreams. At the same time, introducing a competitive atmosphere in the STEM job market help select the best adequate people for the positions, no matter it is a native or foreigner, which in the end do better service to the American society.
