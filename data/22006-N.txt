This proposal is not good for American workers nor for America. Safety of the US comes first, jobs for Americans comes second, and special privileges for foreign students and workers is a distant third. Until our immigration laws are consistently and effectively enforced throughout the country, we should not expand any immigration program. The last two administrations have been weak and ineffective in enforcing our current laws. Until we get our own house in order, we should in no way expand any program.

As stated by Senator Grassley:
"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.'"
