I support this new rule to extend OPT extension to 24 months. As we know, the international students are educated well and for STEM students they have the skills USA badly needs. 

There are many international students working at high tech company like Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM, Oracle, etc. and they contributed a lot to the high teach and make USA sustainable competitive accross the world. They created a lot value, really improved the economy of America.

It's great loss for America to let thousands of well skilled students back to their country and working for American companys' competitor.
