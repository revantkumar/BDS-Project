In this time, I support this proposal at great will.

Firstly, this new STEM OPT extension will be definitely beneficial not only for those international students but also the U.S. society. As we know, many companies hire those international students because U.S. citizens may not be good fit for those positions. If those international students can't work for those companies, the companies will lose a lot of competition and be hard to find proper employees. It will do harm to both U.S. company and society.

Secondly, increasing the marketing competition between U.S. citizens and international students, in this case, can improve the education level of U.S. citizens. It is a fact that only about 50% population has BS Degree in many states. Many U.S. citizens don't like competition because the are lazy. If government executes this regulation will help U.S. citizen to get more knowledge to be competitive.

All in all, I believe this proposal will be beneficial for the whole society in U.S. I'm definitely support this regulation.
