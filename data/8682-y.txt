Xiaoning Wu I am a Master level student majoring in Chemistry, and currently conducting OPT at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Here I give my highest support to the new rule of 24-month STEM OPT extension. Based on my own experience, the OPT is the most important part of my graduate study in the United States. I am really grateful that the OPT brought me to the field of translational cancer research and I have the opportunity to make a contribution to fight against human cancer.

During the time in OSUCCC, I saw many STEM students in our Cancer Center with OPT doing research just like me. We committed ourselves to this meaningful field of cancer prognosis, diagnosis and treatment, which still largely lacks therapeutic efforts in US now. I believe fighting human cancer, one of the devastating diseases killing 8 millions people every year, really needs the endeavor of our young STEM students with passions and responsibilities.

Moreover, I think only the enough OPT period can truly benefit STEM students' research and career. Take my case as an example, cancer research is the field I always wanted to dedicate to. However, our graduate school's research concentrations are quite limited. So I took the OPT opportunity to conduct the research I am truly interested in. It took me a couple of months for the entry training and background learning. The time of the OPT extension was absolutely essential for me to conduct the experiments, write the manuscript and get all the useful results. Without the enough OPT period, my research are not likely to be completed and my project are most likely to be halted. I believe many STEM students have the same situation with me. The OPT is only of value when the students can actually make a real contribution. If the research are unnecessarily terminated or delayed, that will be a loss not only to our students, but also to the employers, to US government, and most importantly to the develop of science.
