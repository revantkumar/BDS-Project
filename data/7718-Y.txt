Dear Officer,

This is a highly welcomed move taken by DHS after a long time, recognizing the importance of STEM to the US economy. I would like to suggest that stem students with advanced degrees like Master's and doctorates should be directly given Green cards instead of OPT as proposed by president Obama, which revitalizes the US economy as a whole and creates more jobs for Americans. Study suggests US technology market requires 1 million technology professionals by 2020. So thereby its evident that the Students with STEM advanced degrees should get green cards.

Thanks!!
