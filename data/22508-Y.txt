I think extension the OPT is good for the USA. Because America needs lots of workers who are willing to do the works that America people don't usually like to do such as dish washer. Also, America is a large country but do not have enough people to exploit it, thus, attracting lots of foreign workers can accelerate the development of the country. In addition, by attracting foreign elite to use their intelligent to contribute to the USA, America can become much stronger. Thus I support the extension of OPT.
