I am totally for the 24-month extension of STEM OPT. I just graduated this may and thanks to OPT I was able to start my career as an engineer. The reason I chose to stay here is because I am a believer in American Dream and I really love the diversity here. I have been making my own contribution to my company and thus to the development of United States. I don't see a reason why we should let the length of OPT be an obstacle for our further contribution to the country, since the companies will be the ones to decide who's valuable enough to finally stay here. I sincerely hope this 24-month extension is gonna work and thanks for listening.
