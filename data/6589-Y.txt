Jack Page This OPT extension has no merit, period. It is unfair to US citizens and also unfair to the foreign students.

The rule is unfair to US citizens because employers will tend to hire cheap foreign labors. There is no wage requirement for OPT workers but there is for H1B workers. Employers like OPT workers also because they are temp workers, by definition, so they can be easily let go. There is no labor law complication.

The rule is unfair to the foreign students who are NONE-STEM majors, obviously. They cannot take advantage of this extension rule. The irony is that those who are classified as STEM students actually do the same jobs as the non-STEM students, as there is rigorous check if the employment is STEM related. For example, many students with math or physics degree work in big banks where the non-STEM students also work. One receives 24 months OPT while the other one does not. Very unfair.

Lastly, believe it or not, this rule is unfair to the STEM students as well. Because of this extension rule, their employer will be less likely to sponsor H1B visa or Green Card application for them, as they can work legally for 2 years to the least. It is easier for the employer to let go an OPT trainee than a permanent worker or a H1B worker. OPT employment is a grey area in terms of labor law.

THIS RULE SHOULD BE STOPPED, PERIOD.
