I think we should agree on OPT expanding for several reasons below.

1. Foreign student who have a stem degree are well-educated and trained, so they will contribute more on both their lives and America society, improve America economic situation and generate more job opportunity eventually. 

2. The foundation of America spirit is open, fair and friendly and that is why america can attract more and more people coming for study. But if this extension proposal failed, it could led foreign student chose other country or home country to study instead of the United States, everybody know that Education is becoming one of biggest industry in America which created tons of job opportunities.
So if the proposal failed, maybe some native america can find a job, but I believe more people will lose job at the same time.

3.As of now, lots of successful people in America were international student at the very beginning, who made huge contribution on the world, sometime even push the development of mankind. However, from now on, if they can not stay in United States, lots of stuff might no happen.
