I strongly SUPPORT this proposal:
1. The government should allow students who studied STEM majors in the U.S to stay longer and to make more contributions to this country. Universities in the United states teach them the knowledge in STEM majors, and it is their responsibility to return something back by using the skills and knowledge they learned to this society.
2. Competition does exist, but this is a good thing, the competitive environment can encourage more native American to work harder and learn harder in science majors. And a society will develope more faster and more comprehensive in every industry when talented people are evenly distributed in every field of interest.
3. The United states is a diverse group. And allowing the STEM major student to stay longer in this country not only fulfills the diversity but also can bring more technical profits to the society and fill up the small number of professionals that this country is eagerly looking for.
