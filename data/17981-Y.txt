This is a great initiative for all F-1 students in US! It's been a long time many talents across the world are coming to US for higher education and some of them decide to further improve their professional skills after graduation. Seriously, this is a favor for US because these highly educated people are the major force for middle-class society in US, and thus a significant port of the US tax payers. 

However, because of all kinds of status restrictions, more and more educated people are forced to leave US because they're out of status after graduation. All majors, STEM in particular, are critical to make sure US's leading role in science and technology, a gene that directs its leading role in the world. If more and more students are forced to leave, this is potentially a loss to US. 

To sum up, improving and extending OPT for F-1 holders is the first step to keep US's leading position in the world.
