I support the initiative, I believe it will bring relief to many individuals and families whose future depends heavily on this issue: having the opportunity to prove themselves valuables towards an employer, towards the generation of ideas and wealth to the US. 

To those Americans that are opposed to this normative: 

The world is currently undergoing a major shift in productivity, there are industries that are in a severe drought of employees and there are areas with a big and inefficient surplus of employees; the United States should not try to balance this equation by creating artificial barriers between the CURRENT workplace and those who are prepared in the critical areas to fulfil those positions available. This is not the economy of the 50's where labor prevailed, right now we are well underway in a service economy that is highly tied to education and preparedness to help the society in general to be more competitive and efficient.

In this global productivity, skilled labor is of prime importance, and attracting them rather than repelling them will maintain the US economy afloat in the decades to come, should current policy makers and society decide so.
