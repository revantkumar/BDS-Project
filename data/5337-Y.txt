An Uan I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons: 1: stem students has contributed to and will continue contributing to high tech industry and research.2. Having the opportunity to work in us after graduation for 2 years is highly likely to connect the us business to the students home country when they go back thus bring more job opportunities to the us.
