Jessica Sun I strongly support the 24 -months OPT Stem extension. It will help US local economies in every aspect, like apartment rental, car sale, food services etc. And it provide a good opportunity for foreign student to apply their skills in professional area, also, company could benefit a lot by hiring good students.
