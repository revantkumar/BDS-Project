Junting Zhu I support this proposal. The OPT and OPT extension rule is a strong support of the education industry in the U.S.. Without further working experience in U.S., a degree from U.S. will become much less attractive and people may choose to study in Canada, France and other countries where further practical training is available and probably U.K as well. Also, the OPT extension is valid only if the hiring company is E-verified. The E-Verify process itself guarantees that the selection of employees is not up to discrimination of national origin which means that whoever gets the employment opportunity whether as a citizen of US or not gets the job through fair competition. Lastly,with OPT extension ceasing, there is going to be a shock to STEM firms. With enormous amount of relocation, lay-off and hiring which would very likely hinder the performance of these firms and further hurt the U.S. economy.
