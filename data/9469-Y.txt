F-1 students with STEM majors are creating real profits for this country, at their best ages. 
Young people all over the world love America, and would love to spend time and effort on this land after graduation. Allowing foreigners to have certain freedom to work in this country is one of the reasons why America is such a strong and great country. These F-1 students with STEM majors are mostly from middle class families in their own country. Their parents would come to the US for visiting their children, which also increases the tourist income. On this land, they are mostly engineers, professors, scientists, while Americans take the managerial roles still. Actually, they will be successful too, if they go back to their own country. However, America will lose these talented people. 

Overall, OPT for F-1 students with STEM Degrees should be extended. 12 months regular OPT is not enough for STEM major students and R&D type positions, 24 months extension should be appropriate.
