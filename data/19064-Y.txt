I strongly SUPPORT the proposal to expanding the OPT for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees!

After reviewing the comments, I see that there are so many American Citizens who oppose the proposal. But from their comments, we can conclude that they don`t have a good understanding of what the policy is and what the policy will benefit US. They solely oppose the proposal because they think foreigners take too many of their jobs. However, the proposal is intending to extend the OPT of STEM degree people who are now in shortage in US. It is illegal immigrants who take the jobs, not people with STEM degree.

As you know, there are so many countries in the world that many of their citizens do not have the right to express their opinions and do not used to do it even they are now in US. So when DHS officers check those comments, please take this difference into account because there are many people who have STEM degree who all SUPPORT the proposal, but they just do not know they can express their opinions here.

Right now, the US economy is in a condition of recovery and improvement. The technology companies are dominated in the economy and they play a really important role. In these companies, there are so many foreign employees who is using the OPT extension. If the OPT extension is stopped, these employees will leave the companies right now and I cannot imagine how great the influence will have on these companies. The companies will face a sudden personnel loss and I don`t think a easy thing to recruit so many employees in a short time. Thus, it may affect the US economy.

To expand the OPT for students with STEM degrees will benefit us and US!
