Yuchen Liang I strongly agree with this regulation.

After completing the undergraduate study in one top university of China, I and many students in my university struggled on whether going to America for further graduate study or staying in China. We are able to find a good job(Baidu, Alibaba) or continue graduate study with salary in top university of China, while graduate study in America, on the contrary, can cost us about 100,000 dollars, which can be a high burden.

However, most of these talented students still decide to go to America for higher education, and the most important reason is that America provides opportunities for our international students to search our careers in this country, which deserves our high investment.

Therefore, cancel or shortening Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students can have a profound affect. Not only students who are studying in America are more possible to go back to their own country for finding a job, lots of talented students can decide not pursuing education in America from the beginning, instead they might just stay in their home country or pursuing degrees in other countries. As a result, it will not only has influence on software and internet industry, Universities and many other fields can also be affected.
