I am writing this comment to implore you to approve this important rule which is destined to make its significant advancement and contribution to the whole US industry. 
From a professional software engineer's view, we know Internet was born in this country which is renowned for its liberty and diversity. People from all over the world have worked here with their creativity and passions and have turned Silicon Valley and even Bay Area into a wonderland of this planet since tens of years ago when the nightmare of WW2 was just over. These smart individuals - engineers, data scientists, mathematicians and more - they work hard day and night not only for monetary compensation but also fulfillment of peaceful childhood dreams with craftsmanship. We are not businessmen, we do not mean to kick any single person out of the market and we do not exactly know how and have no interested in knowing how. We simply are curious about new things in this world and we are only interested in improving our quality of life, and a lot of us have already gone a long way in providing us a better life. These dreams can hardly be achieved in a place where there is drastic censorship and political repression. And we do not want to be out of this peaceful platform and be forced to become a soldier of evil wills instead. Furthermore, those who cannot continue seeking opportunities have a strong likelihood of going back home and making contribution to cyber security issues. 
Therefore I entreat you to approve this extremely acceptable and valuable rule for the sake of our posterity.
