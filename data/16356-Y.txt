This proposal is great for the economy of the U.S. With more STEM F1 student offered a longer term to work at high tech companies, those companies would be able to grow even more competitive globally. It is well known that STEM F1 student are the elites from all over the world. Their input to the U.S. economy will be much more valuable than average local students. With more elite to hire, companies that contribute most of the U.S. GDP will be better off. That's why companies like Google and Apple welcome this proposal. If passed, the U.S. will be able to step out of econimic recession sooner.
