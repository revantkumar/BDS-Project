I strong support this rule based on the following reasons.
(1) United states is a country of freedom and fairness. Anyone should have equal chance. As long as the STEM students are qualified for the job, why should we deny their opportunity just because of their nationality?

(2) It's of great importance to keep high qualified workers working in the US. Those STEM students have proven their exceptional ability by successfully completing the high-competitive degree. They will contribute to the economy and the country.
