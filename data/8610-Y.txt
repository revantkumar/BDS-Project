Siyao Xu I strongly advocate for passing the new proposed rule for OPT for the following reasons:

(1) International talents have long been a significant portion of the working force on cutting edge technology in various fields including information technology, life sciences, etc. Cancelling the OPT rule will result in hi-tech companies losing all of these talents at once, which will inevitably crush the industrial development in these fields vital to the flourishing of America.

(2) It took a significant amount of investment over the years to attract talents from foreign countries and train them with high-quality educational resources at US universities. With all the investment, it would be unwise to deny all the previous efforts. These international talents shall have a chance to pay back what they received by devoting their great energy and talent to the development of the American society.

(3) Not all of the world's greatest intelligence belongs to America. A lot of the world's smartest people are attracted to this land due to its welcoming attitude and its equal environment. Driving these people off the land while trying to keep the same level of employment will result in lowering the hiring standard. It is not a decision for the moment; doing it wrong might harm more than a lifetime.

An important part of what makes America a great country today is its tolerance for diversity. We shall not let go of such merit.
