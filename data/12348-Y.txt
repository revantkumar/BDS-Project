Under "C. Basis and Purpose of Regulatory Action", the action proposal states: " DHS also believes that attracting and retaining such students is in the short-term and long-term economic, cultural, and security interests of the nation." I support and agree with this statement, since United States are based on hard working elite immigration. Today's US citizens were also immigrates 100 or 200 years ago. American dream is built on hard working and equal opportunity, but not wiping out suitable employees candidates with force, which is self-deception. 

"According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year." Rather than complaining the government did not provide enough job opportunities, international students under OPT is creating wealth for the US and gaining work experience for themselves at the same time, which is a Win-Win situation. 

It is also not true that OPT providing foreigner advantage to compete for job opportunities with US citizens. It is obviously easier to hire US citizens than a foreigner, and qualification is the priority requirement for all jobs. Even without eligible foreign employees, the US companies are not going to hire unqualified employees, regardless of US citizens or not. My department (disease diagnostic laboratory) is short in hand for over a year. It is hard for current employees to finish the high service demand, and the department is interviewing candidates all the time. Even our department is really needing more employees, the department is still waiting for the right person. Thus, opportunities are always there, but you can only catch the opportunity because of you are qualified, but not because you are the only candidate.
