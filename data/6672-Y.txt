I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for these reasons:

1. It is REASONABLE for the government to let the students who study and gain knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and apply what they have learned to industry and keep making CONTRIBUTIONS to the U.S..

2. Diversity is a very IMPORTANT part for the US society. As we shall notice, lots of famous scientists who contributed a lot to the country were international students and if they were not given any chance to work here, many great contributions might not have happened. And thus, this proposal is MEANINGFUL.

3. Competition does exist, but a competitive society is actually a good one. International students are not robbing the citizens of their jobs, in fact, international students are contributing the economy of the US and helping companies to select better candidates for their opening positions. The US is always a OPEN society, which is why the proposal is just REASONABLE.
