As a manager of a start up company in Texas, I was trying to hire one junior software engineer for my team. What really surprised me is these students who just graduated asked for 90K salary annually. This is Texas! And no one will pay a graduates 90K a year. Then I tried to looking for international students. I found out they are smarter and honestly cheaper. 
I think our young people are spoiled. I would be glad to see they realize they must be productive and competitive as international students then they can get a job. Frankly, I hope my employee is worthy.
