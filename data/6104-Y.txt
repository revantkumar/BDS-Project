Jessy Mckidala I don't think our Americans opposing to the OPT Extension is resonable. American STEM students and tech workers do not really have difficulties in finding a job if they really try best to get one and not too picky. American companies of course prefer to hire a citizen rather than an international student due to many reasons such as cultural differences, coummunication skills, stabilities etc. I am studing at California State U and never heard about any American STEM students couldn't find a job, instead, the international STEM students have more difficulties in finding a job here. So why we have to kick the international STEM studens away? I think as an American, we have to face the truth is that we do not have sufficient STEM talents at present and we should lead more Americans to study STEM in college instead of complaining here!
