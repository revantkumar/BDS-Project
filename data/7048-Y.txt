I strongly support improving and expanding Training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degree and Cap-Gap relief for all Eligible F-1Students. As far as I am concerned, F-1 students are study hard, and efficient in study and work. Expanding OPT not only give they a good opportunity to put what they had learned into practice, but also benefits the American companies, which are supported by many international workers. To be honest, they actually contribute to the development of American society and economics.
