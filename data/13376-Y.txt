Most of the students are the best of their country. We don't need to spend money on their early education. That is a gift! They provide healthy competition to our American students which helps our new generation to work harder and make more sacrifices for the country. If we want our country to be the leader in technology in the world which affects every part of our economy and military, we need to have the best of the world to serve and contribute to this society. This is who we are as American right from the beginning.
