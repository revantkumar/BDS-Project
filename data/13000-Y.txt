Why are we consistently making rules that favor illegal immigrants over American workers. There are already more than enough stem students that are US citizens to fill the current available jobs in that industry. DHS needs to stop worrying about people that are in this country illegally and start protecting the jobs of people who have come here the right way. While I am at it the TSA has become the laughing stock of the world when it comes to protecting fliers from terrorism. We keep doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. You need to start profiling like our friend Israel does because they have the safest airport in the world.
