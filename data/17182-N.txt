The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
This program has not been approved by Congress so most Americans don't know about it and that we are providing foreign students an advantage over American students. This program does nothing to help the U.S. increase the production of it 's own STEM graduates and reduce the shortage from within and provide and incentive for students to graduate with a STEM degree knowing that they can get a job. Instead it helps our own government help foreign students take American jobs for an even longer period. There is also a bad history in the U.S. of not doing a good job of tracking student visas and making people leave this country when the time is up. 
This proposal is just a bad idea all the way around - it doesn't help American students, it doesn't help American graduates find jobs, and it doesn't insure that these foreign students will ever have to leave the United States. If there is such a shortage of STEM graduates in the U.S. why don't we create some programs to help American students pursue degrees and careers in STEM fields.
