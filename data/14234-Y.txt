To whom it may concern,

I am a graduate student in Chemistry and I am writing to express my hope that you will enact the proposed amendment. I believe that helping highly skilled students to stay in the United States would incentivize talented people to come here to learn and work. The presence of highly motivated and skilled workers is a huge boon to our economy. Many of these workers are highly innovative, and can make fundamentally important contributions to the development of new technologies. As such, I believe that it is in our interest to do all we can to attract and retain highly skilled workers. I believe this quite firmly and I hope you will consider my points in your decision.
