I think it is a very efficient policy. The OPT expanding policy will allow U.S. to absorb more talented international student to work in U.S. and provide more profits for this country. Furthermore, international students are mostly hard-working and determined in their fields. The energy and efficiency they brought to their working positions will bring a huge impact for the entire society which will result in a faster developing pace.
