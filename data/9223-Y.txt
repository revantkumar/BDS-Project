This proposal of 24-month OPT extension is definitely a great news! As a new graduate with STEM degree, I just started to work. My life and career is just starting to get clear. If I can only keep my job for a year, because of lack of experience to find another job in my home country, it will definitely cause confusion and frustration in my career path. 

In the future, I am afraid that there will be fewer and fewer foreign students pursuing higher degree in the US since we can only stay here for a year and it is almost impossible to find a job to practice within only one year. If I was an employer, I wouldn't even consider to hire any OPT employees because of the instability. 

Because of fewer students, of course, there will be less investment into the projects the universities are working on. If anybody ask me why the United States has the best technology and development, i will say it all rely on the huge amount of investments. Germany is a well developed country, why their technology is not improving as fast as US? Because they don't ask for tuition fee, their technology development all depends on the investment of the government. I have studied in Germany for one year and half, i can definitely be sure that german students are as intelligent or even more intelligent than the students in the US.

The reason why US is still ahead of Germany or any other developed countries is because in the US, there are a lot of good universities, and the development of the country rely on these universities. These universities' investment comes mostly from tuition fee and foreign students are paying much much more than the domestic student.
