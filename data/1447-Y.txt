Emmy L. I strongly support the extension of OPT for F1 students with STEM degrees because such rule not only supports U.S.'s economy by allowing more talented individuals to work in the country, especially in the IT and science field, but also create more equal opportunities. Additionally, the rule demonstrate the heart of American dream that everyone, if they work hard for their goals, has a chance to realize their dreams and demonstrate their values. Finally, allowing a more diverse base of the working population will stimulate positive competitions. Everyone will become a better self after all.
