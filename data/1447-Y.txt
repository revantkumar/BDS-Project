I fully support this new rule. Newly international students, especial STEM students dont compete with US citizens. Just compare the number of those international students and the number of unemployed US citizens, foreign students are making negligible influence. Many founder and CEOs of high tech companies are newly immigrations, they are creating jobs and making significant benefits for this country. Friendly attitude to immigrations and international students, especially those with high tech skills, is one of the sources of USs creativity. Keeping those international students away from US wont create more jobs for US citizens, but hurt USs tech companies, and hurt this country eventually.
