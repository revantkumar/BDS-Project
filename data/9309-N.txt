I am a retired Public School teacher, and for 3/4's of my 36 years of service I taught Math, Science, and Computer Applications. I always encouraged my students that a career in those areas would be both good for them individually, and also good for the nation collectively, because the country depends so heavily on technology for both physical and economic security.

The idea that any govenmental agency would encourage American employers to favor foreign graduates over Americans is not only near-sighted, ignoring our national interests and goals, but borders on treason, in my opinion. 
With 15 Million Americans needing full-time jobs why in the world would anyone with a modicum of common sense want to give those US jobs to foreigners?

TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS, AT THE COUNTRY'S EXPENSE !!!!!

These foreign students/graduates pay neither FICA nor Medicare taxes, both of which programs NEED THE FUNDS!!!!. This allows their employers to lower their overhead expenses, but at what cost to the nation??? Higher rates for the reduced numbers of US Citizens paying into the system and/or lower benefits for the retired workers who paid their part during their entire working lives! This is not fulfilling the Government's duty to "..provide for the General Wellfare.."(of American citizens aka "We The People") as set forth in our Constitution.

The fact is that we need to maximize the number of Americans in STEM positons in the US as a matter of National Security, the very subject of your agencie's mandate. How dare you put the country at risk by "putting" people in those positions who owe NO ALLEGIENCE to the citizens of this nation ---- Shame on you!!!!!!
