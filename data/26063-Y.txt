I strongly support the OPT extension policy. I am originally from China, got a master degree of Computer Science in US one year ago. I am currently a Software developer in Amazon. I am those lucky guys who get a job offer immediately after graduation. However as increasing difficulty to get H1B visa, many colleagues like me havent been selected in the H1B visa lottery this April. So currently we have two options: 1, we can apply the opt extension and continue work in amazon and wait the H1B lottery next year. 2, we have to leave US, since we dont have right to work in US after our OPT expired. The second option is extremely bad for us, we suddenly become illegal worker without any self-fault, just due to the new policy. Its harmful to the company too, because only half of my colleagues have got the H1B visa in the lottery this year, the other half colleagues who havent be selected in the lottery face the similar situation with me. I made a rough estimation. 4/20 under my managers supervision will leave amazon if they dont have the OPT extension. They all are the excellent engineers and have been working in amazon for 1 year. The leaving will certainly affect the progress of the project and the whole team efficiency.
