Mao Meng I still advocate for the stem extension and can sense that the policy-making experts have made research and investigation about this regulation's influence. What is America's core competence now? Not agriculture or manufacturing. I think everybody's answer is the high technology industry. What is the crux of technology industry? Human resource. OK, I know some may argue that America can outcast the foreign students and educated American engineers. However, there are some questions should be taken into account before: Is there enough work force now to support the industry without the foreign human resources? Those foreign students are elites from different countries and typically have been learning STEM knowledge 4- 6 years. How long can the IT industry been waiting for the education of American engineers? 

The denial of STEM extension will actually undermine the America's competence, and at the other hand make other countries more competent, which will cause a difficulty time for US economy. If US let those foreign students leave, who will happy? Their home country will absolutely welcome those elites like China, India, Korea. And who else? All other countries, the U.S. rivals in the high tech industry. Just give a frank example, if a Indian student leaves U.S. and works for China now, then he can increase the technology interaction between China and India, but the U.S.'s interaction with other countries will decrease proportionally. The U.S. economy may undergo depression if the U.S. high tech industry is less competitive.

What's more, I really want to emphasize that the economy is a dynamic organism. If U.S. IT companies cannot be supplied by the abundance of labors, diverse intellectual capital and international interaction, they will go somewhere else to find the support, like the manufacture factories, so it is a big concern we should not ignore.
