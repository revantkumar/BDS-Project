Mingxuan He As an international student myself, I believe that the extension of OPT is beneficial for international students and American people. 

For students, especially for college students in STEM, practical experience is really indispensable. During interview, the employers always ask for the students to describe their work experience. In modern society, especially in America, the revolution of technology take place every, but due to the limitation of college education education, the students cannot obtain the first hand experience in the lecture. The OPT can provide the international students a chance to touch the most cutting edge technology in the world. The experience collected in work can assist students in the future.

For the society of American, the OPT can provide the American employers with more change to have elites in their company. America need more talents. The international students from all around the world can provide valuable recourse for the society in America. If we look the way that the US growth, we can easily found out there are a lot of major changes are made by international labors. In modern society, the well education is one of the most valuable resource in the world. The policy of H1B vise has kept away many outstanding engineers, while the OPT can give the employers more chance to hire international students.

Besides that, I want to point out that longer OPT can provide more than that. For college graduates, they got no experience in work place, so the first day of their career life is not working, but learning. The longer OPT means that, the students can contribute more after they master the skills of working.

Swallowing anything and everything has kept America in an invincible position for 200 hundred years, and now, I think extending the period of OPT provide real benefit for both of international students and America.

Best regard!
