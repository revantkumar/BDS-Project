Sriganesh Chandrasekaran I really appreciate the rule proposed by ICEB to increase the STEM OPT period from 17 months to 24 months. First, It will not only help the students to get more hands on experience in various companies/industries, but also help the companies to use the ideas and skills of these budding students. 

Second, Increasing the STEM OPT period will encourage more international students to come to USA and pursue their higher studies. It will also help the country to have more rich diversified culture from around the world. International students pay as much as double the fees of what a state resident of USA pay. This means a steep increase in the revenue for the state. 

Third, During this 24 months companies will have ample amount of time to train and nourish the skills of the newly graduated students. Finding skilled labor these days is like hunting in a desert. If this rule is not passed, almost all the major companies around the country will lose a huge chunk of skilled labor. This may lead to huge financial crisis. 

There are a lot more benefits for both the international students as well as the schools and companies. For the above said and many more reasons I strongly recommend the proposal by ICEB to increase the STEM OPT period from 17 months to 24 months and pass it with immediate effect.
