I SUPPORT this new proposed rule for OPT extension.
This is a win-win not only for American companies but also for communities.
International students are educated in American and they are also making great contribution to the high-tech American companies. If OPT extension for STEM is cancelled, these high-tech companies will lose a lot of support, productivity and diversity. Most of international students are working in the field of science and technology, which will improve the quality of life in our community and gain great fortune for the US. If US still wants to be the leader in worldwide, both in technology and economic, we should keep international students in the field of STEM working for the US as long as possible. In addition, international students are making huge contributions to our community, more related jobs are created because of international students.
The competition from international students is also a great propulsion and motion for local students in the field of science and technology. This kind of competition is good, and both American companies and communities will benefit from it.
