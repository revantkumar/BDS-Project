aswin bharadwaj ramesh I strongly support the proposed rule for improving and expanding training opportunities with respect to F-1 Non immigrant students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.

I am a student who has been working for an US organization, which closely aligns with my field of study and interest, under the F-1 OPT program right after completing my graduate degree. This rule is essential for me to continue working in the USA without any interruptions and continue to develop and apply the technical skills that I have learnt over the years for the productivity of the firm and effective practical experience.

As a student under the non F-1 immigrant visa staying in the US only for a couple of years, it is extremely difficult to abruptly change working environments due to change in government regulations regarding the OPT STEM extension.

Sufficient amount of practical training and in other words familiarizing with work and work culture in the US as a student takes time and this rule of extending the STEM OPT to 24 months will be very helpful.

I have started my career in the US with hopes and achievable goals in my mind. I assume the same with my friends who are in this country for the sole purpose of making use of best resources in the world and expanding the highly skilled work force here in the US by working for some of the best firms in the world who expand the horizons of STEM. An OPT extension rule that aids such growth is an absolute must in my opinion.
