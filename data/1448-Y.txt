I support the STEM OPT program because students with STEM degrees will be able to bring in new ideas which will help in developing new technology that will be very constructive towards building a better future. It also helps in increasing diversity in the workforce so that these ideas from different types of people can be brought to the table which increases the efficiency in the technology sector.
