I strongly support the new proposal of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees,which is benefit both development of the United States and international students who are well-educated in the US.
A myriad of companies,especially IT fields,do need more talented graduations to improve their business. At the same time,numbers of students who receive advanced education in the US can meet the need of them.What's more,as a international student, they also need a plantform to make contribution to society and the whole world with what they learned during the peroid when they got a Phd or master degree. Otherwise,they have no choice but leave the United States and go home. That would be a great loss for the US, for the economy cannot be smooth than ever before without a number of young international students.
