I strongly support the 24 month STEM extension:

The international students consist a large group of highly skilled students that could serve as a strong working candidates in U.S. Benefits / contributions brought by ex-international students can be seen all around. 

STEM students WON'T compete with non-stem students as is clearly required that OPT students should only work at places related to their major.
