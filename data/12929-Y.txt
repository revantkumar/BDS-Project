I strongly support this STEM OPT extension. After international students get their degrees in the US, it's beneficial for both the students and the US to have them work for US employers for a few years. The employers can benefit from the students' contribution and make use of the knowledge they learned in their degree. Why just let them go to contribute to other countries right after they learned everything from the universities in the US? The students also pay tax to the US government and contribute to the economy of the US.

After the international students have worked for US employers a few years, many of them go back to their home country and work as important bridge of the US company and the company in their home country. Those companies become customers or start business with the US companies and this also contribute to the US economy. If the international students directly go back to their home country after they get degree, they will only contribute to the company using the knowledge they learned from the US, but they will not act as a bridge for the company to start business with any companies in the US. However, students who come back from other countries such as Australia and the British will help their current company to start business with their former employer in Australia or the British. The US companies may lose a lot of business opportunities by losing the international students who can introduce customers to them. 

The STEM OPT extension doesn't affect the employment of domestic students. First of all, it is for "STEM" only and requires the international students to work in the same field as their major when they earned their degree. This does not affect the employment outside of "STEM". Even within the STEM fields, majority of the positions give priority to domestic students, and many positions are for citizen only. So the international students are only employed for the positions where domestic students do not fill up.
