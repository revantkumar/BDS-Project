It is absolutely disgraceful that we are sacrificing the future of our college graduates in favor of foreign students for greed. It is unbelievable that an administration that claims to be for the middle class and the little guy is gutting the availability of jobs for our citizens. We have become a nation that is governed by the lobbyists and anyone who can contribute big money to our political machines. This is no longer government for the people and by the people. . This act should not be enacting by the president alone. This is why we have two houses of congress. Our president is overreaching again.
