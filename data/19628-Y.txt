I support extending the OPT program length for students with a STEM degree. In the era of technology, a strong marketing demand in STEM fields. A great number of international students have show their talents in the field. With OPT extension, Companies in the U.S. have more options on selecting new employees and make good use of their expertise. Meanwhile, it also motivate citizens to work on themselves and make themselves be more competitive in job market. It is a good thing for the economic development.
