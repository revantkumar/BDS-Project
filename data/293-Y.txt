Liluoai Xu I strongly support the OPT extension for the following reasons:

First, if there is no OPT extension, much less people who major in stem would come the US for further study because now find a job within one year is so difficult. If there is less people come the US for further study, the US technology industry would suffer a lot because they cannot find good enough employee. As we all see, today's silicon village consists of a big number of foreigner, and the big development of the silicon village relay much on foreigner student.If there is much less student come American, they may still find much enough employee, but not as good as before. Furthermore, the silicon village plays a big role in the American economic development.

Second, when we talk about the US, what can we think of: freedom! The most free country in the world! Everyone in there can have much freedom, including foreigner! this is a most charming thing that appeals people come to American.But if there is no OPT extension, if people come here, they can only stay so little time after they graduate, and they have to return back to there hometown without full enjoyment of American life. So people would have a bad impression of the US.

Third, OPT extension would not bother US citizens life. People who come American for further study always in good quality, they would rise the crime rate.

Finally, OPT extension would not increase the unemployment of the US. If there is more people come the US for further study, the technology industry will get a big development. And there will be more money come from investors to support the technology industry. As a result, there will be more jobs for US.
