I strongly support the extension of OPT. 

1. OPT extension gives the talented foreign students a fair opportunity to practice their skills and contribute to US economy after graduation.

2. OPT extension will also help the diversity of the American firms, as well as American universities, as it will attract more foreign students to US.
