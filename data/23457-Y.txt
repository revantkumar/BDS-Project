From both perspectives of international students and us citizens, this rule definitely should be supported.

1. From international students's view, the hardship behind every job position is far more than what US citizen faced. I am not talking about anything about discrimination. International students has their disadvantage on language, on their different education system. Even with those cons, they can still get a equally paid job. Employer has the reason to do this, which is because they are the only resource can be found on the market. 

2. From us citizens, if u think they are "stealing" the jobs from your own, then pls do as good as they are. Don't complain and shout why they take all of the high salary jobs. This country will admire those people with real talent and hardworking spirit. The competition between international students and local students will make people more competitive.
