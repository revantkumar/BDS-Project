Yes, I consciously support the proposal for improving and expanding the F-1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. As it helps the employer to keep longer the students and helps to promote healthy competition among job seekers, which in turn benefits employers and students.

Also If STEM extension doesn't work out, then it will be disaster for current F1 students and Universities, as some of the universities has very high population of International Students. This will in turn affect the funding of Universities and at the same time there will be huge drop of students entering the country. 

Giving option to let them stay here, will in turn benefit USA, instead of sending them quickly to their home countries where they will strengthen their economy and STEM sector.
