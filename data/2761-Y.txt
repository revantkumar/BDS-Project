Lurther King I definitely SUPPORT this proposal since the extension is benefit for the Americas culture diversity.
As we all know, the America is an immigrate country. From the beginning of this country, the ancestors of American are from the Europe, from the Asia, from the Africa. These heterogeneous people living together create the special culture which contains so different and cosmopolitan content. Now, the international students coming from around the world will carry the cultural gene of their countries to US and facilitate the culture diversity. When these students left the America, they can also carry the American cultural gene to their countries. Therefore, the more period the international students stay in the America, the more benefit of diversity. And these international students staying in the America will also let the world know the America, and also let the American know the world.
