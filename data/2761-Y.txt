I am a Computer Science master student in the US, now in F-1 status. I fully support the proposed rule, namely, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

The US has been benefiting a lot from importing the talent since World War II. One example could be Operation Paperclip, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) program in which over 1,500 German scientists, engineers, and technicians from Nazi Germany and other foreign countries were brought to the United States for employment. Their contributions to the development of science and technology during the Cold War also helped the US defeat the Soviet Union.

Nowadays, the world is largely driven by the high technology and every country is desperate to attract more talented people to build its own power. If the STEM proposal is unfortunately revoked eventually, large amount of students with STEM degrees will have to leave the US. That, is absolutely a huge loss to the US.

So I guess the biggest threat of the STEM proposal to the US is about employment of its people. While some people may think the STEM students cause them lose their jobs, they've ignored the opportunities the STEM-related students can create, explicitly or implicitly. For example, companies that help international students build their careers hire US citizens to edit the portfolio and give career advice from their working professionals.

I support the STEM proposal and do hope it will be approved finally.
