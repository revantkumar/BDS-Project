The STEM extension is an absolutely right way to help the U.S. Economy. 

Company will hire those who are capable, no matter where they are from. And a good fit for a certain job position brings more productivity than not having the right person to fulfill the role. Works in STEM fields require continuous time and efforts, and whoever gets a positionin such fields should be provided the allowance for substantial time to fully achieve. 

America is a country established by immigrants. People from different back ground came and thrived. Together, they built a great nation. Together, they wielded a great success and contributed to the development of the entire world. While current immigration system placed restrictions on foreign workers, but there is no doubt the extension propelling the broken system one step closer to fixing the immigration problems in this country. To allow the capable talents work and succeed here, and to achieve this goal the government should do more to establish a better, and more transparent and fair immigration system. 

Although there are people doubting this policy, I strong feel that this will do much goods in our society. I support STEM.
