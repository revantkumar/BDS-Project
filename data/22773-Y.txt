As we all know, all F-1 students are great assets for the United States. The students did not only bring tuition, but also a strong mind to live here, make contributions here, and realize their American dreams here. I believe the core value of the United States is the equality. Thus, all students no matter where they come from, they deserve the right to work and live here. It is a natural choice to expand the OPT, so that all the eligible F1 students could have more opportunities to contribute here and work together with all Americans to make the US a better place.
