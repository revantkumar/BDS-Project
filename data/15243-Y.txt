I support this proposed rule. Myself being an entrepreneur, I can imagine how hard it is to run a business while in the US because of immigration laws.

Extending the OPT duration to 24 months would not only give me more shots for the H1 lottery, but also give me enough time to raise money for my venture and help grow the US economy and support many other businesses.

I would also like to take this opportunity to put in my word about increasing the H1B visa cap. America needs more and more skilled engineers, and it cannot produce so many of them in house.

Thank you,
