This proposed rule is really good. There are so many IT and engineering companies in America that make great contributions to GDP and make great influence in the word. 
These companies need large number of new graduates, especially master and PHD of engineering areas, because they have lots of research and work experience, and can play roles in the engineering team soon. Lots of foreign graduate students satisfy those companies' requirements and they can provide immediate labor to for these companies, while lots of native students focus on other important majors, such as economics, law, medicine and law. The OPT extension makes companies recruit engineers among foreign graduate students easily and those foreign students can have enough time to work for those companies. 
If there's only 12 months OPT, these new graduates will be forced to leave USA when they become skilled and can contribute to the companies and USA greatly. After they go back to their countries, they can work for companies in their homelands. It will be great loss to those companies in America and the economy, make USA lose advantages in the engineer areas, and even destroy American economy in future.
I definitely support OPT extension and it's significant to our economy and keep the advantages in engineering areas in the world.
