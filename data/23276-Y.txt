I support this new OPT extension rule.

1. A long OPT is a huge attraction for international students. This will benefit the US academic institutes as international students will pay high tuitions. This also will benefit the whole country by bringing more intelligence people here.

2. International students are not taking over US citizen's working chance! The country is in huge need of STEM talents! But obviously they can't find enough native STEM employees. Many tech companies need internal students to work for them. They are actually helping make contributions to the US economy.For many big technology companies like Google, Apple, FaceBook and so on, international developers takes a large percentage of all the employees. If the OPT extension rule failed, many international employee will lost their jobs immediately, which will cause huge turbulent in these companies. Besides, many projects will take as long as two or three years, if the OPT can be extended 24 months, internal students will be able to make better contribution to the company.
