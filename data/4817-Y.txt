I think it is very good to have a 24 month OPT extension for STEM student. One of the most beneficial aspects is that international students with Doctor degree can do their postdoc in US, which is a necessary path for them to become faculty member in universities in US. Nowadays, the academic research in STEM is heavily depended on international scholars. There is a large portion of faculty members in STEM are international scholars. Many of them accomplished their phd in US. However, when they finished Phd studies, most of them need to have a postdoc training before they become faculty members. Usually, the postdoc program takes 2 years in STEM fields. The one year OPT at now is obviously not enough for these high level STEM academic intelligences to finish their post doc. In this case, many US university will lose the opportunity to have these intelligent people to be a faculty member in their departments. Therefore, I think the 24 month OPT extension for STEM students is very necessary to keep US leading the academic research in the world.
