Please open your Eyes and realize that the visa program that alows forigen workers into our country to do the jobs that were at one time job for our teens and college students. You are taking the work experence from our children. With no summer jobs for them to learn true work experence amd earn the money needed to help pay for school and in some cases help their ffamilies. The youth in this country are getting a bad rap because they don't have opportunities to get work, and when they go the wrong direction no body wants to hear what the problem is. Give them back their weekend and summer jobs and do not leave them idle with nothing to do. This is for the betterment of our country. -
