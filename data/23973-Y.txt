I strongly SUPPORT the extension of OPT. Here are my reasons:
1. I still remember what I learned from history course: After the second world war, Soviet and USA discussed how to distribute spoils. Soviet got machines and USA took talents. After decades, the fact shows contribution made by those talents were hundreds and thousands of times value than Soviet's machines. Talents are always the most valuable wealth not only now but in the future. Extension of OPT is strongly attractive for international talents and students who might play an important role in the future.
2. American history is a history of immigration and pioneer. Of course now USA is much powerful than 200 years ago, but is it properly to kick down the ladder now?No, freedom and equality are the symbol of American spirits. Like the spirits, extension of OPT gives international talents more freedom and chances to contribute to USA. Also, American dreams is a dream to get equal chance to fight for someone own future. That is why I SUPPORT OPT extension.
