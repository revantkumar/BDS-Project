I support this extension policy .

Markets are changed all the time. In fact, as a a people from hire group, there is less than half year that we are opening to the hire market. Due to the re-organize of the market, we need people all the time, but we don't have enough time to find the best person. We use our education to develop so many international students, but 1 year, we barely have a chance to use them. THAT IS PATHETIC !

Also, american students are really not interested in some boring and hard study. SUCH AS ELECTRICAL ENGINEER. They choose to avoid these majors at their will. BUT WE NEED PEOPLE TO DO THE TOUGH THINGS!!! You wouldn't like others to do, and you yourself have no interest. THAT IS REALLY NOT FAIR. We can't be so naive. 

From the beginning to the end, competition contribute a lot on development of everything. That is truth of science and society.
