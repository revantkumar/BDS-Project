Harper Guo I strongly support OPT extension. Some people may hold a belief that international STEM students are stealing local peoples jobs in the US. However its just groundless. Instead of stealing jobs and worsening economy, international STEM students are CREATING JOBS and BOOSTING ECONOMY for the US citizens. 

Actually international STEM students have never stolen any jobs that should have belonged to some local people. The reason why some local people cannot get hired by some job positions is that they are not qualified enough in technical skills, but those international STEM graduates are. In addition, international STEM graduates, in many cases as far as I know, are making great contribution to creating jobs for local people. I used to work at a reputed company in the field of shale gas exploration and development, and my team leader (who is an American citizen too, but he never compliant about the stolen jobs) got a few international STEM graduates together to develop a novel technique of micro-seismic fracture monitoring. This technique directly created more than twenty thousands jobs, and indirectly created much more. And the local GDP was estimated to increase 0.09% just because of this technique. And note that this technique belongs to the US, benefiting the US in the long run. 

So American people need international STEM graduates to create more jobs and enhance our economy both in short term and in the long run. Extending OPT length helps get there.
