I have been reading many of the comments and it's interesting to see that many people are "outrageous". Many of them claim that this Rule will give foreign students "preference over US citizens". This is simply not true. 

What this Rule does is only to provide opportunities for nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees to enter the job market with US citizens of similar background. It is the employers who will evaluate the quality of candidates and make the final decision on hiring. None preference is given to foreign students, and in fact, many employers are less likely to hire foreign students to avoid the additional paper work. In addition, many of the nonimmigrant students are with advanced degrees (MS, PhD) and it's simply not true to claim all of them to be unqualified. Again, let the job market decide, and may the most suitable job seeker gets the job.
