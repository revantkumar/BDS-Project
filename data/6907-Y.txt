As a foreign STEM student, I strongly support the 24-month OPT extension. 
I need more time to train myself. The current 12-month OPT is not enough for me. There are to many projects which needed one year or longer time to complete. 
I would interrupt the whole team and the project if I leave at the middle of the project. Usually, these projects will improve the competitiveness of the company. The company may be able to create more job positions with the projects. It will also let me lose opportunities to gain knowledge.
So I support the 24-month OPT extension.
