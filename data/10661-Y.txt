I think the extension is a benefit for both international students as well as the technology companies of United States. First of all, technology companies need people especially STEM students. And the market of technology is a central market for U.S., this is a huge benefit for global technology improvement since U.S. is a leader for technique. In additional, it is very good for American economy. Second, with an extension, STEM students can obtain more experience rather than struggle with OPT, which can helps STEM students acquire the skill sets they want to contribute their country when they go back home. That will make OPT valuable, even the colleges of U.S. can bring more international students which can expand the influence of U.S. colleges.
