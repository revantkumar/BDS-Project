Zaisuo Zheng I totally support the extension of OPT. International students are a huge valuable source for the technology companies in US because international students have strong academic backgrounds and they can work well thus they got hired by companies. US get more benefits than disadvantages from the OPT extension since international students want to make contributions and in the past years a great number of breakthrough are made by international engineers and scientist. In my university, lots of TAs and professor in engineering are international people, and they are talented at STEM major. 

There is no reason to stop this proposal because US depend on international engineers and scientist. Although the unemployment rate in US is high, however the majors with highest unemployment rate are not STEM majors.(http://www.studentsreview.com/unemployment_by_major.php3) Here is an article that describes the shortage of STEM talent(http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real) . "There are some 40,000 computer science bachelor's degree earners each year but roughly 4 million job vacancies for computer workers." So US need to encourage the international STEM students rather than force them to leave and make the situation worse in US industry. 

International directly make economic contribution to America. Here is a report that says"The Economic Benefit of International Students $26.8 billion Contributed; 340,000 U.S. Jobs Supported"(http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/eis2014/USA.pdf). So for the economy benefit of US, the OPT should be extended.
