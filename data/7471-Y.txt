This is a great move by the DHS and USCIS. What people don't understand is, we the international students on the STEM degree are actually contributing to the American Economy. Comments like "you are killing America" is simply baseless as the government itself has termed the STEM issue to be economically significant. We invest a lot of money taking mortgages at high interest rates just to study and work for sometime so that we acquire skills, pay our loans and then can go back to our country to continue working. We pay way more tuition than the residents and citizens. We are not here to take away the American jobs. The work visas are issued by the government because they know they need international workforce to contribute to the economy. If you see the hiring process, the preference is always given to an American citizen and then the rest. The government is not stupid to pass a resolution like this. They have made enough provisions for local people to get jobs. Please consider this issues seriously and look at the bigger picture.
