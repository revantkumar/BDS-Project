G. E. Fraz No; to expanding the F-1 students work program. There are plenty of citizens who need those jobs... This program has 
never been authorized by Congress. Currently, foreign students who have been pursuing their degree for at least 9 months 
can work in the U.S. for 12 months or 29 months if pursuing a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) 
degree. The new rule would extend the program's length from 12 months to 36 months for these STEM students. 
The program incentivizes U.S. companies to hire foreign students and recent graduates because they do not have to pay 
the prevailing wage or their share of the 7.65% payroll taxes for the foreign worker, costing Social Security much needed
funds. I have to pay FICA tax, they should too. ... While we are at it, eliminate the foreign workers program all together and 
let them hire US citizens.
