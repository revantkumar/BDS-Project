I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

I am so confused about the people who do not agree with the proposal. As to the opinion that these students are competitors to U.S. citizens, which is so ridiculous. Think about who can apply the extension, they are the students who get at least a MASTER degree. These students are highly educated, so it should be a benefit for U.S. as these people can make contribution to U.S.. Can everyone work as a Big data analyst? NO. They might compete with a few U.S. citizens in this field, but without competition, NO innovation and improvement will happen.

Also, the extension is just a change for the foreign students, each U.S. citizen has the equal opportunity to the job fair.
