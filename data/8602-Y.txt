Wanrong Dong I strongly support the rule to extend the STEM OPT period by 24 months. STEM students contribute a lot to the U.S. IT and related Industries and U.S. economy. Without their contribution, the U.S. economy may decline. If the U.S. economy declines, Americans will lose jobs for sure. Therefore, STEM students don't take away Americans' jobs. Instead, they help Americans keep jobs and even create more jobs!
