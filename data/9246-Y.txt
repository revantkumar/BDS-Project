I strongly support the proposal for extending STEM OPT to 24 months. Science and technology is extremely important to every country and that's also one of the reason why the United States outstands among others. There are lots of smart people and powerful companies in STEM field in the US and international students with OPT work an active and important role in it. Extending STEM OPT to 24 months can help the US develop its science and technology and keeps its position in the world.
