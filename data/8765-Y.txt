There's no doubt that this extension should be approved. It is better for STEM students, the US, and in turn, better for general US citizens. 

In many industry fields, especially high-tech industry which consists of major economy growth in the US, graduates with STEM OPT are contributing a lot as this group is highly-skilled, full of passion, and self-motivated. Because of the current H1b lottery policy, many highly-skilled non-US graduates cannot get a working VISA shortly after graduation; as a result, they leave the US soon after graduation. It is sad to see so many talents are trained in top universities in the US with resources from the university, government and tax-payers, and then after being equipped with outstanding skills, just go to other countries and create things there. Extending the OPT to 24 months essentially gives these talents the faith that the US welcomes those who are capable to create things, to make a difference. They can apply their knowledge and skills directly at the places which is their best fit, not worrying about the working permit. 

This extension not only benefits the STEM students, but US citizens in general. Only with talents born in different countries, the US can maintain its creativity and growth in many fields like high-tech industry. With the economy growth brought by these high-tech industry, the government and the market have the money and the need to create more jobs in the field like service, commerce, and entertainment. This will, in turn, create more jobs for general US citizens.
