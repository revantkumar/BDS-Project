I fully support this new rule! In fact I think it is necessary to expand the opportunities for students with STEM Degrees. Because these students are playing important roles in the technical companies like Google, Facebook and etc. They are the one who make contributions to the society and yet being looked down upon. It would be unfair and ironic if the rule did not passe in a democratic country like the United States.
