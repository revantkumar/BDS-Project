They aren't US citizens. Circumventing Congressional approval is unlawful. The Administration wants to raise the minimum wage but, at the same time pay American STEM workers less money by hiring non citizens. Is this a joke? Scrap this biased program and place qualified American citizens in these jobs. Only then, if you can't fill all required positions do you offer them to non US citizens. The F-1 program needs to be 12 months period. Let's build this country on the backs of qualified Americans not political favoritism.
