I am an engineering professor in a US research university in Missouri. I strongly suggest to approve the OPT extension and enhancement for F1 students majored in STEM degrees. 
I was born abroad. I came across the whole process of F1, OPT, H1B and permanent residence. OPT is a critical step for these F1 students who graduate from the American universities to stay in USA and contribute to US economy and society. These students do not "steal" the jobs from US citizen. The reason is that very few American students want to pursue M.S. and PH.D. studies. For instance, in my department every semester only 3-5% of undergraduates go to graduate school. This number is far from demand from companies when these domestic students graduate. Therefore, there is a big gap for the high-tech companies to hire enough qualified advanced degree graduates. On the other hand, a lot of M.S. and Ph.D. international students brought to USA through the support from government research funding which is from the US tax payers. It will be not wise to send them away after they graduate, especially to American competitors. Therefore, extension of OPT for these students will enhance US economy growth and maintain the USA leading role in the whole world.
