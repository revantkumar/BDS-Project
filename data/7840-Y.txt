I strongly SUPPORT this STEMS extension program.
Those foreign students are smart and competitive people who go through tougher interview processes than domestic students in order to get the same kind of job. They bring in a huge amount of value to our nation.
They are not competing with US citizens because the employers would always prefer to hire a US citizen to avoid those immigration processes if a US citizen is as good as a foreigner. A company on hire a foreign when it cannot find an equivalent citizen to work for that role.
Also, diversity is extremely important to a company. 
We should support and welcome these international students.
