I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1) More talented people around the world could be attracted to the US.
2) Those talented people will make a great contribution to the US economy, particularly the IT area.
3) The blooming economy will create more job opportunity accordingly, this is a beneficial economic cycle for all the people live in the US.
