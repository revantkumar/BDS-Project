As a senior student in China and decide to apply for the graduate study in U.S in computer science, I think there are two reasons that I support this plan of act:

1. Most of the Chinese students even foreign students benefited from OPT period in which they could get handful experience in practicing their knowledge and skills learnt from their universities. Without this premise, it is hard for most of us to gain valuable opportunity to learage our career future and difficult to give honors to the institutions we have stayed by spreading the better opportunities studying in US other than any other countries.

2. US economy relies on the individuals who own STEM knowledge to build up and it's crucial for US to consistently gain interests for more foreigners with high-tech capabilities to come and shape this country

It is good for not only myself and the US, I in this instance support this claim of act to be carried out
