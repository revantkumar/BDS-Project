I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..
2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. That is how the U.S. thrives. 
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition helps improve our life.
