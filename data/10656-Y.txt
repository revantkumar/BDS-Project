I strongly support STEM OPT policy. 
Many of the comment that oppose this are because of one thing: Jobs, competitions! Admitted, international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. You may find it harder to get into Google or Facebook because there are more talented people in the pool. However, if we reject them simply because of this, we should not educate our children at all every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition. In the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.

What's more, those talented international STEM students can also create jobs. According to Kauffman foundation, Immigrants were almost twice as likely to start businesses in 2012 as native-born Americans, and bout one-quarter of the engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 20062012 had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.

Let's support this policy with a better US
