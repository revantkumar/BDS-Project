It's always the truth that an open and diversified talent market with positive competition rather than conservative protectionism contributes more to a nation's progress. Europeans know about that so they amended their labor laws in 2012 with extended residential time for international students after their graduations to encourage employment. Japanese know about that so they announced an ambitious "Accommodation Plan for 300,000 International Students" in 2008 with strong support to keep talented foreign students for the Japanese economy recovery. Chinese know about that so they have been endeavoring to attract their millions of overseas trained students back to stimulate their economic boom with numbers of talent projects. It's intriguing that what kinds of strategy the U.S. government will adopt in this increasingly furious competition for top-notch human resources around the globe.
