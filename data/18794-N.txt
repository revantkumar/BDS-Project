Our family is against this proposed new rule. We feel that there is no place in the Federal Government to be helping foreign students at the expense of American Citizens who need jobs in this sector.

As a small business owner, we have had many job applicants who had STEM training but who were not able to find jobs in their field because of the influx of foreign workers.

In Florida, Disney fired their entire IT department and replaced them with foreign workers allowed in by our lax immigration standards.

Until our country has filled all of it's tech jobs with citizens, we have no business allowing these jobs to be taken by foreign students... and at NO time do we have any business forcing the American taxpayer to pay to train and place these students.

People who come to this country should be grateful to be here, and should not burden the American taxpayer in any way ..... especially not by taking their jobs.

US Tech workers are being displaced by foreign workers and students at an alarming number and this is totally unacceptable.

This rule should be abandoned.
