I strongly support this rule get passed to continue keeping U.S competitive in the world and stimulating U.S economy. 

1. As of 2015, there are 1.13 million international enrolled in U.S college this year
2. Extrapolating the data from 2005 of percentage of students in the public or private school, there are about 79% of student would go to public school. 
3. International student are paying out of state tuition in public school which is $13,819 difference each year than a in-state student plus average $1000-1500 living expense per month. Every year, international student generate about 23 billion dollar in each year. 
4. This was not included how many extra job are created by the increasing international students arriving in the states and many other revenue are generated by the international students.
5. If we vacate currently 55,000 OPT student and giving the jobs to citizens, the data as of 2015 the median salary is $52,250, transferring to 2.8 billion dollar a year saving for citizens. 

If anyone consider a 2.8 billion dollar to a 23 billion is a good trade, please go ahead keeping oppose the rule get passed. 

THINK ABOUT UNITED STATES OF AMERICAN NOT INDIVIDUAL AMERICA!!!!!
DON'T LET MINORITY BIAS AFFECT MAJORITY BENEFIT IN THIS COUNTRY!!!
