As a student in college, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
First of all, the students who studied abroad tend to be more independent, flexible, passionate, and hardworking, most of the international students I've met are excellent learners with high GPA. I believe they can make a huge contributions to the U.S. after the studying. 

Second, I admit that competition does exist, but I don't think it's a good thing because people are motivated by competition, and employers would have more choices and bigger chance to select the perfect fit for their positions. 

Competitors make us all better learners and better workers, only lazy people who don't want to learn new skills, who just want to stay same, who don't want to become a better worker and better person will hate competitors.
