Education opportunities for international students has helped enhance the rate of technical growth and has helped USA flourish.Through research and innovation in engineering and science related fields international students have had a great contribution to the development of USA and help maintain its position on the global front. The first few years of a student are more related to his/her personal development. Students usually start contributing back through research/industrial projects towards the end of education as they approach their thesis completion. Only if the legal permit to continue work/research is extended to at least up to 3 years is when they could really contribute through the skills that they have learnt during their education. If their stay is interrupted in a year which is the amount of time it takes to get accustomed to the work environment, the true contribution of their skills would be ineffective. 

I have worked as a mechanical engineer and have been able to make impact to a lot of current product sales that have happened in the past one year. If I receive an extension I can keep making my contributions and putting my hard work in helping the company I work for deliver superior products. I strongly support stem extension being extended up to 24 months.
