Jian Guo I would say this is great cause we all know that STEM students are in great need in US now and most people work in these areas are not native, most of them are students from other countries. They spent a lot of time and money to study here, they should get the chance to work here, at least to earn their tuition fee back. Also, they will help to build the economy if they could work longer here.
