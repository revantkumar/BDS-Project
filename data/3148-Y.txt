Mabel L Nelson I strongly SUPPORT the OPT-extension for the following reasons:

1. We need highly skilled technical workers as many as possible to fill the talent demands from very profitable US tech companies. It does NOT make an sense that the government kick those students out after spending huge amount of research funding training these students in top U.S. universities.

2. Since we pay higher tuition, the institutes have more funds to improve their facilities and provide more professional services to ALL the students. Don't forget about the multicultural environment featured by collision and merge of different culture is an important index when evaluate the quality of the education of one institute.

3. 12-months seems not enough for foreign students to gain enough work experience. For example, some school doesnt have CPT. And if students want to have an internship to get to know more about the industry, they would have used 3 month on internship. And after that, if they feel really interested in working in the industry in U.S. they would like to seek a full time position. Some companies spend a few month training fresh graduates, so it will only be a few months left for foreign students to contribute professional skills to the company, which is less worthwhile for the company.
