Dear Sir,

In case yo don't know we still have a huge unemployment problem in this country. Extending this program to 24 months is not what we need.

"This Cap-Gap relief allows such students to automatically extend the duration of F-1 status and any current employment authorization until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B visa is being requested."

In case you don't remember, the terrorists overstayed their visas and attacked America. Why would we make it easier for these unaccountable guests to stay here longer when we don't know where they are located? 

"STEM experience that supplements knowledge gained through their academic studies, while preventing adverse effects to U.S. workers." 

It is a proven fact that STEM workers are replacing American workers over and over again. This is NOT good for America! 

Please don't extend this program, just end it!
