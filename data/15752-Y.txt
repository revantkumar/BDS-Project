As an international student, I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposal!!!
I don't understand why people say terrible things about STEM extension. International students from all over the world come to United States using their expertise in their fields to contribute to this country. If there is no STEM extension, there will be less opportunity for those international students with talents to stay and use their talent to contribute to the country.
