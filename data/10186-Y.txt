Mr. and Mrs. Charles R. Hofacker,

The problem is not in OPT itself, which is beneficial to America when implemented right. This is why the new proposed rule strengthens regulatory and reporting measures to prevent abuse and inefficiencies. If you visit a university career fair, you'll easily find out that, the majority of employers are not willing to hire international students due to the tedious and costly sponsorship procedures. Only the best international students can get jobs in the US, the rest will all leave. We want to retain the best, because they keep this country technologically and scientifically more developed than other countries. Regarding the number 430,000 you mentioned. A lot of it was taken by fraudulent "universities" that operate illegally. If you want to make America great, I would encourage you to look for such "universities" and report them. So this new proposed OPT STEM rule when done right is absolutely beneficial to America!

Sincerely,
