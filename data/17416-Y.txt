I support this rule strongly. There are many reasons for this rule to be passed.
1. Nowadays, many companies in IT area have already employed many talent students from other countries, most of these students have not get H1B, in other words, they still in OPT condition. If this rule won't be passed, these students just can give up their jobs. This is not humane to them and will also let those important companies get a critical loss, and they can't get enough talent employees in a short time.
2. This is rule is just for students who studied in areas which most Americans don't like to study in. If this rule won't be passed, these areas will loss many talent, potential workers and researchers.
3. If this rule can be passed, there will be a benign competition in job search, so every company can get talent and appropriate employees with a high quality with professional knowledge.
