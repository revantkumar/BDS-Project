Would you please write me and explain to me just how improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students will help our college students that are US citizens advance in their own careers and find jobs while at the same time help these F-1 Non-immigrant Students. Also would like to know how it would help our Country's job outlooks for our own Citizens seeking jobs. 

Thank you for your thoughts of why this improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for eligible F-1 Sutdents would be a good thing to do .
