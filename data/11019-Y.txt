I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. It benefits US economy with having talented foreign people work in IT area.
2. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
3. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.
