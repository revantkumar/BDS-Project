meghan follansbee To Whom it concerns,
We are at a cross roads here in USA, and in dealing out dated policies and failing systems for programs and education. Universally this does not look good, and it important to train and educate all people, and some how make it affordable for people to live. This has to do with degree programs and training opportunities in all cities and towns.
It seems that there is money available, we just have corrupt politicians who take advantage of veterans, housing where conditions and infrastructure is not maintained for building and housing codes, this where fraudulent activity happens often, and adds to the trauma and helping individuals get a new lease on their life.
I hope significant changes can be made sooner than later. At this time there is really no one who one can honestly trust to get the Job done.

Sincerely,

Meghan Follansbee
