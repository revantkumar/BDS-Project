I think new OPT extension rule will attract more intelligent brains worldwide to U.S, which will only benefit the country as well as it's people. I hope the government can be objective on this issue. There is a lot of complains saying that foreign students steal job opportunities from citizens. I'd like to share one fun fact on that. When I was studying for my computer science master at Upenn, there aren't many citizen students in our program. All citizen students in our program got a good job offer and honestly, they have much wider choices than foreign students.
