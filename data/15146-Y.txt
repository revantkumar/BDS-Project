Craig Casey I believe this succinctly states exactly why this regulation should be put in place. Many science and engineering fields lack the ability to find qualified individuals in the necessary educational areas. Removing the ability of foreign students to stay in the United States for an extended period of time will only exacerbate the hiring issues some companies are already having. Hiring employees from a diverse set of backgrounds also encourages new and better ideas. I know, from my time in graduate school, that having people with a dramatically different background helped me develop a better understanding of the world around me. This led to a deeper understanding of the core educational areas on which I was focused.

In order to take advantage of the benefits we can gain from synergistic teams in industry, we need to have diversity. Innovation is at the intersection of diversity and knowledge. The foreign students from these programs clearly serve a dual purpose here. Our technology companies will fail to prosper at the current rates unless we allow these students to stay in the United States. These two years could be crucial to allowing them to stay for a much longer duration. This gives them time to write academic papers, present at conferences and disseminate the knowledge that they learned from an American University. These are very important for them to gain a working visa due to ability and not just a random lottery. I am very supportive of this regulation and hope that others find the importance in helping the students find a more permanent home here.
