I am strongly supporting this action for the following reasons.
1. Extendending STEM will help United States economy. International students can apply their knowledge into Science, Technology and industry immediately with OPT and STEM after graduation, which will increase the pace of technology innovation, resulting in better economy and thus more job opportunities for Americans. 
2. More input will be there if there is more time staying in USA. In the area of Scicense and Engineering, there are a lot of research areas which need a lot of research time and tons of trials. If someone has the intelligence and ability to create something fantastic, why don't we restrict the time of their staying and thus blocking of the possible breakthrough, which will bringing great benefits to Americans?
