I strongly support this proposal as it would help international STEM graduates to obtain practical training in their STEM major. Also, education without relevant practical training would be useless when international STEM students return to their home countries. In addition to practical training, the international students could also gain cross-cultural experience by working with diversified workforce in U.S. corporations.
