I support OPT extension rule. The OPT policy attract many international students to come to the US for education and these graduates will join in high-tech industry in the US. As we all know, the advanced high-tech industry is supporting the US economy. If the OPT extension rule is canceled, this would be a disaster to the high-tech industry in the US. 

I strongly support the new OPT extension rule!
