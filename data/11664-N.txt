OPT denied American workers more than 430000 jobs during a 4 year period. Also, OPT stole 4 billion dollars from SSAN and Medicare.
The jobs these students end up taken could go to the 90 million Americans that dropped out of the work force. Also, there are many American STEM works but companies will betray citizens and hire immigrants to save a dollar. The immigrant will be paid between 18-40% less than an American. Example of this betrayal is the recent action of Disney. This company forced 500 American workers to train their immigrant replacements if they wanted to receive severance pay. This created 500 jobless American STEM workers. This is not an isolated occurrence. So this demonstrates this program should be eliminated not expanded. All government programs that facilitates employment of immigrants must be stopped not expanded.
