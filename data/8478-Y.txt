When are people going to wake up? You don't vote and force our gov. to do the right thing for born and living in our country citizens then we deserve what we get. In case you sheep haven't noticed, the gov. stopped teaching gov. classes so that big interest groups could run the country with money tactics. I hope that everyone who voted for Benedict Obama gets what they deserve and are left out in the cold scratching their heads.
