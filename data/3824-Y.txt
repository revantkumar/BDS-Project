Cheryl Ray Really??? Why would you have a mentoring program for foreign students as opposed to American students? Do the Zuckerbergs of America and big business really need to make more money by encouraging cheap labor and getting payroll tax breaks? We already have HUGE immigration incentive programs to replace our American college grads...plus out of control illegal immigration keeping wages stagnant. Enough is enough!
