Isabella Yang OPT should be extended.
1. Foreign students choose to study in US instead of other countries mostly because of its OPT system that enable them to find work opportunities and gain work experience in US before they return to their native lands. If OPT is not extended, fewer foreign students would choose to study in US.
2. Many internship projects in U.S. companies expands over one year. If the OPT is not extended, many projects would be stopped in the middle of the vital point and would affect the company performance.
3. Many professors and faculties in higher institution came as foreign students at the beginning. An extension in OPT would enable them to finish their research projects, thus enabling them to stay in the institution and share the knowledge with student from U.S.
