I strongly support this proposed rule because of the following reasons.

Firstly, international students play an extremely important rule in high tech companies. With this rule, their opportunity to contribute both directly using the knowledge learned in US colleges and graduate schools, and indirectly with the high tax contribution they made to the country, will be much better. 

Secondly, most of the negative comments are based on imaginary situations, filled with passive and desperate opinion and can not reflect the true view of capable U.S. workers. I don't think they should worry too much cuz most of the graduated students won't seek for similar positions these commenters currently have(if they do), and thus cannot be blamed for those commenters' jobless situation.
