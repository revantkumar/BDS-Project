I strongly support STEM extension, but increaasing H1's will be more helpful. But for students who pay $45,000 for Masters like me, 3 years is enough to pay off back the loans and to gain enough experience. But we want to work after that too, its because of the work culture, you cant send back students based on one single lottery which is unfair.

Please dont decide the fate of the students with lottery!

Its like you guys are insulting us!
