It does not make sense if we educate these students and send them back when they are ready to contribute to our society. There is no doubt that we need talented people, especially in STEM. Why do we turn them away while almost every county are trying their best to attract these people? They don't steal our jobs. They do a much better job than average Americans. That means they create more jobs, pay higher taxes, bring more values to America.
