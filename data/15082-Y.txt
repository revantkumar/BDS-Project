I strongly support this regulations. 

This regulation can let American academic school/university more attracted to best students and researchers around the world. This will overrall improve the learning environment for American students with better atmosphere. 

Also, F-1 students are big part of employees in technology companies. Without this regulations, those company may have difficulties in hiring such large amount of work force. This will then impact US economy.
