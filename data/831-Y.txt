I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government spent money on educating the students from US universities. We should let the student stay in the country and let them make contributions to the society. 
2. More than 95% percent US citizens of whom the ancestors are from outside the US. We should keep the door of the American dream open. 
3. Many successful big figures are from other country. The states should keep attracting elites come to this country but not keep them away from it. These people will create more job opportunities for US citizens but not compete with them.
