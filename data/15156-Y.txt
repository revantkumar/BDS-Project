Hi, As international student, I would like to say, companies like
Infosys, Tata CS, Cognizant , Accenture takes most of the jobs.
Almost 2/3 of H1B amounts are taken by them, which always hire
people without considering candidate true ability to make contribution to
this country. They only care cheap labor cost. Thats how job opportunities and compensations are being harmed.
