Chao-Ming Hong To whom might concerns,

I am writing this in response to the USICE proposed rule, improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

I graduated with a Master in Computer Science at USC. When I was still at school, most of students at graduate school are in the United States on F-1 visas. And we will be strongly affected by the proposed rule.

I strongly support OPT and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. OPT and OPT extension is important for the benefit of both employer here in the u.s. as well as international students. Expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.

In order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best Regards,
Chao-Ming Hong
