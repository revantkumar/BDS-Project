The United States has a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with Americans to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Form previous data it is very clear that, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of citizens of U.S. Opponents of OPT program argue that this would cause cause fewer opportunities for the citizens of U.S. but that is extremely shortsighted and any informed report would argue otherwise, as OPT program is a temporary opportunity and it does not affect the total employment figures in long term. I would also like to mention that a lot of foreign-born students have gone on to help create some of the biggest organizations in the United States therefore actually creating more jobs in the process.
