I believe to altleast be with the previous rule as of 17 months of stem extension, as the international students are spending a lot of money over their studies and they will have only one H1B chance for lottery. It would be unfair to cancel the stem extension for the stem students, who are working already as well. I guess this might also impact the future international students to think over their plans to study abroad.
