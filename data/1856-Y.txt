I think it is good to let the STEM students have 36 months OPT. There are many excellent international students and it will be a pity to lose them only because they cannot get the H1B. The international students are definitely needed by the employers because many difficult tasks need to be done by people with advanced knowledge. The number of American students who have such quality is not sufficient to do all these tasks. 

Previous experience also shows that employers tend to keep employees who have working experience. Suppose that an international student has been working for a company for 12 months and already learned the set of skills required by the job. However, because he/she cannot get the H1B from the visa lottery, the company has to lose him/her and get another person who has no working experience at all. Apparently this is a loss for the company. However, if the OPT is longer and the international student can obtain the H1B from later trials, it will be a double win for both the student and the company.
