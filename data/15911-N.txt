With over 30% of American citizen STEM graduates unable to find work in their chosen field, continuing stagnant wages for those in STEM/Tech related positions, and ever increasing regulations on all industries, it is critical that DHS drop the proposal to expand the OPT program.

Rather than expansion at a time when so very many Americans our unemployed or underemployed, DHS should be looking to clean up the current programs and ensuring that Americans can get back to work.
