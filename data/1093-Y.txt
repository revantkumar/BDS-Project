I strongly support Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.

US needs international students to contribute to the economy. According to NAFSAs latest economic analysis, international students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year.

It is not giving jobs that belong to Americans to foreigners, but creating a win-win for both Americans and International students by creating more jobs and making the American-born workers more prosperous.
