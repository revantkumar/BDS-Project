Not like other countries, the United States is known as a country full with freedom and opportunities. People who work hard can achieve their dreams here, no matter where they come from, or what kind of background they have. And I believe, most of people who come to US, they are not very rich, they may not have no power, they are just normal person in their own country. It may be impossible for them to be successful in their own country. What they have are only dreams, and they believe they can make their dream come true in America. So they study hard to learn as more as possible, they also work so hard to get money to support their families and tuitions. After their graduation, they really want an opportunity to apply what they have been learned from school. They have many ideas about how to make things better. They work much harder than most of native Americans as they know how difficult it is to find a job in a foreign country. But They are still grateful for what they got. They are smart, they are hard working, They are grateful, All they need just a permission to work here and an opportunity to achieve their dreams. And I believe that they deserve it.
