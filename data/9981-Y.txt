OPT Extension is surely beneficial to the country given that how largely US economy lies on technology.

STEM OPT is exclusively for the students who meet the need of US employers, especially under the condition that this need cannot be met by US citizens.
Compared to other countries, US benefits from previous 29-month STEM OPT. Otherwise, lots of foreign students would not have chosen US as an ideal place for education, simply because they lack enough time to get trained. A lot of English-speaking countries offer high-quality education to the people all over the world. Universities in US need a reason to stand out.
A lot of technology companies all over the US provide great opportunities for students to get trained, and vice versa, those students benefit companies by productivity and diversity. Since almost all the tech companies announce that they are equivalent employers, it is hard to imagine that STEM students are deprived of the right about equity that they once do have.
