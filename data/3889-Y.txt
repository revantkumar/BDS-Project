As a US citizen, I strongly think US should retain talented foreign students while preventing abuse from the racial discrimination.Also,I support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. 
Besides those, I suggest the new OPT rule should be improved by these steps:

1) very clear and high enough prevailing wage requirement for employers to recruit students on OPT
2) set up a black list of companies that abuse OPT and H1b, those in black list will be forever barred from using OPT or H1b program.
3)OPT program should only be available for students from top 50-100 US universities, the current provision "accredited Universities" is too vague.
