I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. 

Diversity is a very important part of United States. Immigration is how American Dream started. Now United States is one of the most powerful country with very advanced technology in the world. Stop giving OPT to foreigner student might have a relief in a short term, however, in the long term, it will cause a significantly negative effect on economic of United States. Those students with very strong STEM skills will be forced to leave United States, and they will not be able to make any contribution to United States. Look at how many foreign students in US universities? 

With a no OPT extension, there will be fewer foreign students choose to study in United States! Canada or Europe, Australia will be better option. Education is already a industry in United States, this will cause a huge loss to US economics too!
