I strongly support the proposed rule for the reason below:

International stem students are not "low paid" workers. Medium salary of International student is $60,000 according to Employment report https://willamette.edu/mba/programs/eccc/career/employment_report/index.html. However, medium salary in US is $26,695 according to Social Security Administration, http://www.mybudget360.com/how-much-do-americans-earn-what-is-the-average-us-income/. 
It is obvious that Foreign students are well paid. Instead, Most foreign students are paid better than U.S Citizens.
