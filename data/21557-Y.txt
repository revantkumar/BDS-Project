I strongly support the proposal for several reasons:
Firstly, international students learned a lot of advanced technology from our country, they should make their contribution. If they don't, they maybe come back to their countries and join in local companies. This is not a good thing for our companies. With these international talents, our companies will be more competitive in the whole world.
Additionally, I don't think these international students will make our citizens lose their jobs. Because all companies will first consider US citizens, if there is no right person for one position, why don't we refuse the eligible STEM students to contribute to our companies? Refusing them will be a huge loss for our country!
