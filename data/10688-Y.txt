Shruti Marwaha I vote for the 24 month OPT extension for STEM Degree students. This extension will be really helpful to provide the students the right training. Whether they stay in USA or leave after that, this training will be critical for their career. Unlike what many people think, this extension does not "steal jobs" from US citizens. This OPT extension only helps to provide training in STEM fields and does not help in getting a job in a high tech company.
I am a PhD in Biology and the moment recruiters realize I am not a citizen or permanent citizen, they never call me back. Companies do not want to file (and pay) for H1B. These companies are not ready to invest in candidates who would need work sponsorship after 29 months of employment.
So, the STEM extension is the only way to get a job in academic setting; there also, not all posts are open to immigrants. 

It is not just the immigrants who will benefit from this new law. Most people come to USA for the opportunities and cutting edge technology. Lack of opportunity will also be a loss of talent for US in a long run. 
Moreover, these students contribute to America's growth through development of technology and paying taxes.

I request everyone to analyze this situation thoroughly and then make a decision.
