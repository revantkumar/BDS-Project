I absolutely support this change! This is good for the international students, in a way that is definitely not hurting the US economy. Actually, it will benefit the US.

For the students with STEM degree, they need this extension. With this improvement, they don't need to worry about visa status, at least in two years. They can better focus on the work and training. That's what every employer wants to see.

If this change becomes real, it will attract more and more international students to study in US, and bring billions of dollars revenue for the university and the local economy. If you don't believe me, check out Michigan state's case.

I don't understand why people are complaining this extension will cause US people lose jobs. I just graduated from STEM major. Let me tell you some numbers. Only 1/15 of the students in our department are US citizen. Why? Because most of the STEM major are dealing with "tedious work". People simply are NOT interested in them. When looking for a job, these 1/15 people are the priority because US companies always want to recruit natives. All my US fellows never worry about finding a job. On the contrary, only the very best foreign students can find an opening.
