Hello,

There are many advantages with this proposed rule, to both the United States and the international students. 

-International students will get an opportunity to work for more than current OPT period which will directly have positive impact on the economy. 
-After studying Masters in United States, highly skilled STEM students are providing major contributions to the field of research and development like never before.

Good economy->more jobs->less unemployment

Thanks!
