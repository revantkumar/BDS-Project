I strongly support this OPT extension rule. OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, how can US attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country? Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. Foreign STEM talents probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy. Besides, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those projects would lose their VISA before the projects completion.
