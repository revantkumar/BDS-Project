andre zink I oppose this proposal based on 2 reasons. 
1st, the purpose of F1 visa is to allow foreign students study in the US. The purpose of OPT is to allow these students have a chance to have some experience in the US industry. However, the extension of OPT is a 3 years working visa in reality. It violates the fundamental definition of F1 visa and OPT. 
2nd, by using 1 year OPT, we make the competition of finding a job more intensely for foreign students. Then we can make sure only the best of the best can work here. With the extension of OPT, basically we welcome everyone work here no matter he/she is competent or not. We can take the risk that allowing some Americans not able to find jobs to keep the best people. But we shouldn't allow Americans to lose their jobs because they are substituted by foreign students, especially both of them are able to do the job.
