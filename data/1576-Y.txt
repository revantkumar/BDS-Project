Dhananjay Khanna As an international student here in the States, it was a dream come true for me to move here and be able to study in an amazing environment.
I feel the OPT extension for STEM fields is a goal that the US needs to have, because the fact is that we often come here through a lot of struggles to achieve the dream of a better life. It is this background that makes us entrepreneurial.
Think of this extension as an investment in your own futures. Many of us create small businesses and thus create jobs for other Americans. This is especially true for STEM majors.
I ask you to invest in us today, so we may invest in you tomorrow.

Yours Sincerely,
Dhananjay Khanna
