I strongly support this extension of OPT for the international students. Here are the reasons.

1. Just look at the high-tech cooperation, many of the employees are international, especially for the positions require the students in STEM majors.

2. Since the US universities are admitting the students all over the world, the government should keep those who receive the high quality education staying and making profits for the country.

3. According to the recent years news and report, the "new-immigrant" are making a lot of the contributions to the US GDP and revenue.

4. US is a country of immigrants, and this diversity in cultures make the country more competitive in the world.

5. Everyone is equal and should have the chance to work here if they are qualified for the position. The government should not involve a lot when the employers are making their decisions to hire one qualified employee, no matter he/she is international student or not.
