I would strongly support the OPT extension for the following reasons:

1. Silicon Valley is one of the greatest contributor to US Economy. The major new employers there are international students. The cancel of OPT extension will have a critical impact on Silicon Valley. I believe the US IT industry will experience a huge setback and lost the opportunity of competing with other countries, like China.
2. International education also contributes notable amounts to US economy, especially after 2008. The cancel of OPT extension will force international students to seek education opportunities in other countries, e.g. Australia, Canada and Europe. One of the major reason the international students choose US instead of others was the opportunity to work in US.
3. The jobs STEM students get are those most US citizen do not choose or cannot do. The US citizen who can work in these high-end job are still much more competitive than international students because of the risk of H1b visa, culture and language gap and stability.

Overall, I believe OPT extension was an import support to help US recovered from 2008 financial crisis, and it will still contributes a lot to US economy for the next decade.
