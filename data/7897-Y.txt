Frank Edmunds If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. International students also help promote a global learning environment. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. The additional OPT time will provide STEM graduates with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network.
