Paul Swinton I strongly support the STEM extension proposal.

I saw some people complaining that this policy will make it difficult for U.S. citizens to find a job. However, this is not true since the number of U.S. citizens who work in the STEM field is much smaller than the number of positions within this filed. The IT industry is growing rapidly, and America need to support this growth by bringing in global talents.

Besides, lots of employees of IT companies are currently on STEM extension. If the policy is cancelled, these companies will face severe problems.
