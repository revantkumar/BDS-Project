I support the extend the OPT period by 24 months to the F1 students in STEM majors. 

First, it will bring diversity to the communities of many industries, that will eventually lead to innovation and good economy for the whole country. 

Second, it will not necessarily cause competitions with US citizens. U.S. has relatively the lowest unemployment rate and especially in the industries of science and technology related. And international students with STEM majors only constitutes a very small portion of the population of job candidates. 

Third, if the department of immigration did not approve the extension, it would have restricted many students to practice what they learn in the U.S higher education institutions. Instead of the U.S., international students would have chosen the other countries, like U.K., to be their destinations to receive higher education. It might cause a great loss in the industry of Higher education in the U.S. 

Fourth, the extension will be for STEM majors only. The number of qualified STEM F-1 students is very small, that can be ignored compared to the number of openings and candidates overall.
