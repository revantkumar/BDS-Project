I support this rule without any reservation.

First, this rule keeps the America's promises to the whole world: As long as you are talented, you can make your American Dream on this land. Of course, international students studying STEM are a big part of talented people.

Second, we spend a lot of resources to educate these international students studying STEM, definitely we want to keep them and make them work for us to make America great again. With no doubt, we want to extend their OPT to make them do more contributions to America in STEM fields.

Finally, extending OPT is both beneficial to them and us, it is a win-win solution. That's why I support this rule.

Thanks for reading.
