Francis Lin I strongly favor this regulation. International students have made up a large portion of the U.S. high-tech workforce. Current OPT only allows for 12 month, which is far from sufficient for most work. For example, in my company, a typical work would last more than 2 years. Without the extension, we can not hire international students and it is extremely hard to find qualified U.S. workers. 

Besides, OPT extension would increase the attractiveness of our education system, which means attracting more international students. Those students can not only become part of our high-tech source, they can also serve as the ambassador who transmits our culture to their own mother country.
