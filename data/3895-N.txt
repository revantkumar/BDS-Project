Why is Homeland Security offering jobs to nonimmigrant students when we (the U.S.) have millions of people out of work?

This is asinine and another example of the Government trampling over the U.S. citizens.

How about being realistic and worrying about the economic welfare of our own people?

Please justify your recommendations!
