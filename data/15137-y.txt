Yi Shi I want to continue respond to comments from John Miano who is the lawyer that brought the lawsuit against OPT program

You said that "The proposed rule creates national security issues."
You commented that "For example one of the 9/11 hijackers had been admitted on a student visa.
Requiring schools to track former students who have not been in attendance in the last 3- to 3-1/2-years is
unrealistic and creates a security issue."

This comment is extremely INSULTING and WRONG!!!

Firstly, very ironically, your example of 911 terrorist attack serves as a counter argument to your case.
Following the 911 attack in 2001, there was once a significant tightening of F1 visa to international
students because one of the terrorists who launched the attack was on F1 visa.
However, the result was a huge destructive blow to US economy and US education system and finally US
government officials had to go abroad to launch an aggressive campaign to convince international
students to come back.

Secondly, international students are victims of crimes instead of problems of national security. Too many
examples in which international students were killed by domestic crime and terrorist attacks and I just
point out two:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Ming_Qu_and_Ying_Wu

Thirdly, as you should know, the two largest groups of foreign students come from India and China. Can
you give any example in which any terrorist attack against USA was launched by Chinese or Indian
student?
