I absolutely SUPPORT this proposal that extends the STEM OPT to 24 months. The reasons are as below.
Yes, we all have learnt the Econ 101, this lesson teaches us the Solow Model that the economic growth only depends on three elements, including labors, capital, and technology. In history, the rapid growth of US economic most depends on the international labors which includes the international students. And these STEM students are also the carriers of high-tech. In the long run, the high-tech is a critical point to stimulate the economic growth. Therefore, the 24 month extension for international students is necessary working in US.
