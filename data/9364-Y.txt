Zeyi Sun I agree with this extension. Extend OPT for F1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees will not influence the job opportunities of the US citizens or permanent residents. These kind of professional jobs need to recruit the candidates with appropriate background in special knowledge and experience, but not their citizenship. Thus, these jobs are not solely opened for the F1 students, but to all the people with decent qualifications.
