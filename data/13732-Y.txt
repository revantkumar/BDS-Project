From my personal experience, I think both the F1 students and the US economy could greatly benefit from the 24-months STEM OPT extension.

I, as a F1 student in the OPT, has been working in a world leading US IT company for 8 months. The first 6 months were mostly spent on getting familiar with tools, projects, and people. If no STEM OPT extension, I would have to leave the company in the near future, which leaves almost no time for me to deliver my skills into products. I have spent many years of my time and a lot of US resources to develop those skills through the training provided by both the company and the US graduate school I attended. Leaving US now would be a typical loss loss case for me, for the company I am working for, and if thinking about combining the STEM F1 students together, including students who are currently in the OPT training, still in the school, and considering applying US schools, it will be a tremendous loss for the entire US economy. In contrast, the proposed 24-months STEM OPT application gives both the F1 students and the companies reasonable amount of time to finish one high quality project.

In short, the STEM OPT extension will create a win win environment for both the F1 students and the US economy.
