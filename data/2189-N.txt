The U.S. allows one million legal immigrants and 700, 000 green card workers per year into the country. Is that not more than sufficient? Once again, our President tried to bypass Congress on this issue which in and of itself raises the issue of legality. Did not the Democrats used to represent the middle class of this nation but once again we find a liberal based agenda being overseen by what should be a totally unbiased organization. The middle class of the country is almost non-existent and much of that is due to foreign workers and borders(especially in uncertain times such as these)that have not been closed. The h1B visa system should be discontinued as well as the OPT until all students born in the U.S. have been given every means possible to fulfill their educational needs. It's quite comical to watch the agenda unfold as each and every day one of our rights is attacked, Democratic candidates speak of more executive orders and ignore history and speak of the untold benefits of socialism and the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and look who has been in power. So many believe the "Great American Spirit"is dead and gone.Trust me you are quite mistaken! In fact it grows stronger everyday and it only escalates when it starts to infringe on our kids, their education,their welfare
and this program quite aptly fits that category.There are some interesting statistics that I believe the American people should know about OPT in how it removed 4 billion from Social Security and cost Americans the loss of over 430,000 jobs. Quite interesting. Thank you for your time
