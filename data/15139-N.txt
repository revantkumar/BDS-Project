American students deserve first chance at jobs in America. How can they pay back their student loans when their jobs are given to foreigners. Do you think Americans are too stupid? Big business and the Chamber of Commerce only care about profits and not America. Government is way to big and is not responsive to Americans. I can't wait until Trump gets in office and cancels all these terrible policys this administration has forced on us. STEM jobs should go to American workers.
