I strongly support extending OPT to 36 months.
The reason why USA is technology leader is because of PEOPLE, especially young people. USA is attractive to best talents from all background, all countries. International makes USA always have best ideas, technologies, products and economies. If USA cannot create opportunities to hold those best people, it will essentially become another North Korean. Elongate OPT period should undoubtedly be the first step to hold these young people.
