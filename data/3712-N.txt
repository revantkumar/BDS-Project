Please accept this comment on the proposed expansion of the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program.

I understand that this program gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign college students studying in the U.S. over American college students that desperately need jobs and also categorizes the foreign-born students in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes. 

This complaint is supported by a 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) that cites that there are sufficient American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sector and that encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has a major impact on wage suppression in tech-related fields. 

I support U.S. STEM workers and American students seeking STEM careers and ask you to reject OPT.
