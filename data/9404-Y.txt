I had never really given any attention to the F-1 OPT program until I became aware of the intention to expand it. I am not only in favor of not expanding it but feel it should be curtailed or completely eliminated. We need to be focusing on providing jobs to US citizens and not providing them to foreign students while subsidizing US industries.
