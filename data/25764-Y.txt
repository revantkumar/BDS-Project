I highly support the new rule. Some people argued that foreigners take over jobs with lower payment from Americans. I found argument here "they can not speak English"...But let's take a look at international students in STEM. I believe you would find official statistics. These international students in STEM are well-educated (university education in the US, maybe have master or PhD degree), they speak English (probably bilingual, or even more), and highly skilled in specific areas like engineering, math, compuer science, physics, biology etc. They have no advantages compared to Americans when looking for a job. They are hired because their skills meet the requirements of employers. They are not paid lower than average (limited space here, please check statistics if needed). Many of STEM international students are working at critical high-tech positions and contributing a lot to the economy in the US. Retaining these people will be definitely beneficial to the US. Please support the new rule.
