I highly recommend OPT extension.

As we all know, every year hundreds of thousands of international students make the decision to come to the United States for their further education. One of the most important reason they choose U.S not other countries is the OPT benefit which provide them opportunities to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period. If government cancel the OPT extension, less and less international students will choose this country, and U.S. education will face a problem.

Moreover, as of September, 2015, over 34,000 students were in the United States on a STEM OPT extension. If government cancel OPT extension at this time, what should these international students do? U.S. government and U.S. education lied to them since they were told they have 17 months OPT extension when they came to this country!
