Wenyi Dominique Today is the last day to submit a comment, and I decide to come and say something. For the sake of Americans, I think we should support this rule.

Firstly, lots of universities offer scholarships for PHD, especially for STEM students. University pays for their tuition and living expenses for nealy five years. After they graduate, why do not let them stay in US and work for US? If we take them back to their home country, why we pay them huge money for five years?

Secondly, OPT students also pay taxes. Every year, OPT STEM students pay a considerable propotion of tax, and this is also an aspect of promoting American economy.

Thirdly, 24 months length is a good choice. As we all know, native American STEM talents cannot meet the market demand, so companies and technology institutions need to hire huge amout of international STEM students. If we cancel the OPT extensions, or the time are too short, the cost of hiring new employee and training fresher will become huge for a company and technology institutions. And changing people in the middle of a project is really disgusting.

Finally, after attacks happend in Paris, US still agree to admit Syrian refugees. We can risk the safety issues to welcome those Syrian regugees, why cannot we accept those people who are well-educated, and can make a lot contrubution to American economy and technology? As far as I know, most STEM students do not intend to immigrate to US. They just want to obtain some experience in US, and they need to go back to their home country to stay with their family. So, OPT extention is an Win-Win policy.
