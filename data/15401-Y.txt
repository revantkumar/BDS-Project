Thanks for DHS for providing the rule for 24 months OPT extension. This is really a good driving force for US economy and long-term development.

Firstly, most international students with STEM majors fill numerous critical positions in US companies in different fields, from energy to medicine, from manufacturing to IT. They have brought about significant industrial revolutions and boostered up the American economy. 

Secondly, I don't think OPT extension will deprive the job openings that originally belong to native Americans, because people with STEM majors hold PHD degree in science and engineering in most cases. The positions these people take require very high criteria for knowledge, expertise and training. 

Thirdly, from the perspective of employers, their intent is to enroll talented and intelligent people for contributing to the corporate growth and revenue increase, no matter where they come from. Undoubtedly, these international students with STEM majors are those with tremendously outstanding attributes.

Last but not least, as an immigrant country, USA should keep such good tradition to welcome people from all over the world who have the American dreams, and more importantly, the superior ability and intelligence to continuously build USA to a bigger and bigger country.

Taken together, I would strongly support the US passing the rules.
