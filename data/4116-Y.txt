I oppose the extension of PTA program for F1 visa holders by another 2 years. Its my belief that a total of 2 yrs (1 yr + 1 yr extension) should be sufficient. Just having enrolled in a US university does not give rights to work in the country, which I believe is the expectations of the new graduates. I also believe that there are enough American workers available to fill in these jobs.
