In the past few days I have seen quite a lot of comments with no nutrition at all. Indeed, in some sense the OPT extension affects those "citizens" who do not work hard but still want to get a job which pay well. These lazy guys with almost zero contribution to US economy drag the improvement of the whole society. They never tried to work harder or contributed more. Their job is just complaining about everything that will be put in to use except reducing tax and free everything. It is really sad to see these kind of people. By the way for those who really know economy and the well fare of the people, they should know the extension of OPT STEM should be approved. If not, the whole economy and the everyone will pay for that indeed.
