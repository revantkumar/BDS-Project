First statement: I support the OPT extension. And I want to report a website with misleading and malicious information for the opponents, www.stopoverreach.com. This website provides confusing and inaccurate information on purpose and templates for the opponents to comment. This is disgusting and despicable! These people are doing without considering the fairness. I propose that any comment which resembles those listed on that website should be considered to be void.
