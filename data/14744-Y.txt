Most arguments against the extension are: we have enough US citizens who are good at science and engineering, and we should save job openings for them instead of hiring foreigners.

That is not true!

STEM are tough majors, nobody can be expertise in STEM without years of learning. However, if you step into the graduate school in any US university, in those STEM departments, you won't see too many US citizens, probably at most 20%.

However, US economy needs outstanding STEM talents, those who understands Stochastic Differential Equation/Machine Learning/Quantum Physics etc. These talents are the reason that US remains the strongest country in the world since World War Two. Every country is short of talents, especially USA. Why should we ignore the 80% and push them to our rivals.
