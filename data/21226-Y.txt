This rule is important for America especially for high-tech companies. As a recruiter in a IT company, I found most candidates that best match for our positions are F-1 students. If these rule could not be enforced, we could not hire enough qualified employees, which will bring a great damage to our company.
Therefore I strongly support this rule.
