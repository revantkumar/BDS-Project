Please give opportunity back to Citizen teenagers or adults working their way their school or a stepping stone position in the workforce. By putting forward new regulations for foreign workers to fill these jobs what chance has a citizen have in this country anymore for work experience or to obtain employment. Our wages continue to go down because of the very companies who hire foreigners so they can pay them less of a wage, this is causing all other wages to decrease with every year that prices on food, gas, and rent continue to rise. This is America abide by our Constitution to protect American Citizens and our welfare not the welfare of citizens of foreign countries. Take back America and let Americans have hope for success and to get out of poverty. Do not expand F-1 Visas. Thank You, Mrs. Lisa Oaks
