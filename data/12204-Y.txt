I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1.Generally speaking, international students have a fairly good family background in their own country. Those who choose to stay in USA after graduation have their big dreams to achieve, thus they work hard to contribute a lot to America. Extending the STEM can both help the students themselves and improve the country's industries.

2.Diversity is a good thing, the world will finally become one in the future. America is leading in this concept among the world.

3.As for the competition, the STEM major students focus on the industries requiring high education level. Students are trained in American universities, thus they know how to apply those knowledge back in America Society. in the long term view, this helps the American society to become better.
