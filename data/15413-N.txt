The thought that additional foreign workers will be brought to this country to compete for jobs that could be done by American workers and WITHOUT paying payroll taxes is unconscionable! Americans are tired of an administration that continues a policy of putting aliens' rights over the rights of American taxpayers! It's absolutely unbelievable that this is even a possibility! 
Employers should put more money into vocational training programs to teach our young people the skills they need to do the technological jobs that need to be filled rather than bringing foreigners to our soil!
