I strongly SUPPORT this new rule of OPT extension.

Companies in the high-tech segment hire qualified people only, regardless his/her race, nationality and veteran status. Given the advantages, such as better communication skill, more local connection etc., why do you think the companies still prefer F1-OPT student over some citizens? The ONLY reason is those students are more qualified for the job. Excuses are tools of the incompetent.

USA is an immigration country. The ONLY reason it can be a superpower is because of that it welcomes the highly skilled foreigners to come and make contribution to this country. The attractiveness fade away as we see more and more local protectionism. I have a negative view on the outlook of this country which relies heavily on immigrants but is deviating from its foundation.
