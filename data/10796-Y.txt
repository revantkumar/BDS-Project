I strongly support the OPT extension, which will greatly benefit both US and the international students in this country. 

On one hand, the OPT program benefits US academy and its students. As an international student myself, I found the team more productive when it has larger diversity in its members, especially with people from different cultures. This diversity help us look at things in different angle, come up with independent ideas and solve problems more efficiently and creatively.

Also, according to the Guardian, there are more than 740,000 international students in the United States, which tops UK (around 427,000) and France (around 271,000). This large number means that the majority of the worlds most talented people are contributing to USs academy and education. The OPT extension, from the US government, will keep this country the first choice when international students look for overseas opportunities where they can make full use of their knowledge and skills. 

On the other hand, neither the OPT extension nor the H1B will cause US citizens to lose their jobs. As its specified, the OPT applies only to e-verify employers, which means there are tons of other job opportunities out there that are not for international students. The OPT and e-verify are doing nothing but ensuring an equal opportunity for employees such that the e-verify companies essentially get candidates that are the best fit, regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, etc. This non-discriminative spirit is what makes America America.
