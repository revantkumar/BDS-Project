Daniel Zhang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S, which will undoubtedly keep U.S strong and more attractive to the most talented scholars in the world.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. U.S need to attract more talented people from other countries.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. American citizens will work hard and learn hard due to the competitive job market, thus making those U.S companies stay strong.
