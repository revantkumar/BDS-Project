The government of United States is always the leader in the world issuing policies to attract the best talents from foreign countries. Foreign talents have made great contribution to US employers, US government and US citizens by working hard, inventing new technologies, creating potentially significant value to Americans. The OPT extension policy is among those policies. Since the OPT extension policy was issued, more and more international students have been attracted to US to pursue their education in the US. They have contributed by paying tuition and living expense during school and kept contributed their creativity after graduation. As more and more international students come in, the situation of H1B visa lottery become severe. This severely prevent them from making contribution to the US. I would say if longer extension of OPT is possible, both the international graduates and US will benefit to a great extent. This is a win-win game. It is reasonable that DHS should extend longer time of OPT for STEM students as more and more international students pursuit their education in the US. It would be even better if more H1B visa would be issued for foreign works.
