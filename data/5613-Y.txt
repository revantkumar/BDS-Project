Flora Zhang If people say we are stealing their jobs, I want to say they do not even know how hard for us to find a job in the US. We are facing much more difficulties than them in the job hunting. First of all, we must have very strong tech background if we want to stay. Secondly, we must be able to work in an English-speaking environment which is not our mother language. And these are only very basic requirements for us, do not mention we are losing a lot of job opportunities just because of our citizenship. We are not complain this unfairness, instead, we know we need to work harder than them so we can get a job. If they can just understand a little about our situations, they will stop saying this is stealing. Because this is not, we study hard, we work hard, we are creating value for American society. We earn money based on what we learn, we are not criminal. Also, only skills is not enough for us to stay any more, we need luck to get the H1B visa. Can they understand? This extension can give us hope. We pay a lot of money to get a degree here, why we cannot just do a normal job nowadays? We came here because we have an American Dream and we trust that the US can give us opportunity to let our dream come true. American was built because of immigration. I do not understand why they forget this. I am 100% to support this new extension policy. Not just because it is good for us, but also I think we deserve this. Thank you.
