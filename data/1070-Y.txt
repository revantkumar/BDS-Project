I agree with the OPT extension. If the extension is cancelled, the whole economy of America will lag behind. I heard some people saying that an international student could raise four American families. The education is commercialized to some extent. The main attraction to study at America is the chance to work in America if you are competent enough. However, if the extension is cancelled, a lot of students would go to Australia and Newzeland or Endland, this will have a good impact on these coutries' economy. Besides, the weather is much better than America. How could America achieve education revenues compared with these countries. The whole economy will go down, let alone the talents who are major force of constructing America. 

So, I strongly agree with the extension.
