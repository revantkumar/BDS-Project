I strongly support this proposal since this would bring a lot of benefit to big companies in US. The F1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees always have the skill sets which are very scarce to high tech companies. Although if a lot of people complain that they can't find any job since these F1 students filling a lot of opportunities, even without these students, they are still not qualified for these high tech jobs need technical skill set. Obliviously, this proposal would help high tech companies to find really good resources and keep talented person to make contribution. We all have the same goal to make US stronger and stronger! Thanks.
