I fully advocate the decision of retaining and extending current OPT extension. This will definitely strongly benefit US technology industry. Those foreign students get educated in US and learn about high tech in US and those who are seeking extension are already working in US for a year. Therefore, extension could will benefit US by letting those skilled and qualified students to spend more time help US tech company produce tech products with their passion and knowledge.
