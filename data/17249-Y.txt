Please consider the following 5 points in favor of the OPT extension.

1. Discouraging for Hiring Manager; Graduates don't get interviews.

It is discouraging for a hiring manager to interview someone who cannot stay more than 12 months with a company.

2. Full time not applicable, contract Only. What's the gain for a U.S Company?

No hiring manager would hire you full-time knowing the candidate's fate of continuous service in his company is based on a H1B career lottery system after/during limited OPT period.

What is the gain for the U.S Company here if he or she has to leave? 

3. STEM graduates do not take away American Jobs

The STEM graduates are not taking away jobs from Americans. A hiring manager hires a candidate who impressed during interviews with sufficient technical knowledge.

4. Even if hired, it hinders commitment

If hired on a contract (most probable), knowing that I am only in the company for few months and my performance will not be counted for other openings (Because of time limit on OPT), hinders commitment to perform at office. 

5. Most graduates loose a month or more anyway (Start date):

Unless extraordinary, it takes 2 to 3 months to land a job, cutting valuable time from 12 month of OPT. Even if the graduate choose a start date after 2 months, the start date of a job and start date of OPT never matches, which still takes away valuable days if not months from 12 month OPT
