Max Smith I strongly SUPPORT the OPT STEM 24 month extension. As a manager in American tech company, I have the F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees working for me. I think that extending the OPT length for another 24 month will not only have some good for STEM students, but also is very beneficial for American company and US economy. First of all, those international students work very hard in my team. They are smart and creative, able to quickly solve many difficult problems. If they can work for the company for another 24 month, I am sure that they will bring more value to the company and make the company more competitive. Secondly, we pay the same amount of money to international students as US citizens. They don't form an unfair competition in labor market. Those F-1 nonimmigrant students also consume in US. They purchase many stuff for their living. They rent apartments, buy cars, go to restaurants, and shopping online. They create many job opportunities for US citizens rather than get jobs away from US citizens. If they can stay in US for another 24 month, they definite can make more job opportunities and contribute more to US economy. So please approve this great regulation!
