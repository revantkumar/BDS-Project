I STRONGLY SUPPORT this rule for the following reasons.

First, there's no doubt that this rule is very critical to the economy of the United States. Foreign students with the STEM degrees not only fuel the economic growth, but also contribute many taxes to the US government. Without them, US government will face huge economic loss and it may do harm to the infrastructure construction to some extent.

Second, foreign students with the STEM degrees bring about many innovations. Each years high-tech companies in the USA hire a lot of talented elites from different countries. If USA would like to keep the dominance of high-tech, it definitely need to hire more and more brilliant people, no matter they are local citizens or foreign students. The extension of OPT will attract more talents and thus boost the innovations.

Please go ahead with this rule!
