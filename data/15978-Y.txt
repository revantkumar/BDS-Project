I choose to SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. With the rapid development of these area, students with STEM degrees are in great need. Only hiring the US students is not enough. If relevant companies can not hire more employees, they will feel difficulty in maintaining operation. As a result, economy in the US may get affected.

2. if this OPT policy is cancelled, the US will lose a lot of talent engineers, lose a lot of opportunities to gathering these engineers to make a world a better place.
