I think improving and expanding training opportunities for f-1 students with STEM degrees is a good choice. 

For all those years, these STEM graduates have made great contributions to the development of IT industry in America and thus made America a better place to live. Without their efforts, many great IT companies cannot achieve what they have done today.
