I support OPT extension rule.

A nation leads the world only by the advantage in STEM. Realizing the reason why they've lost 20 years in the past, the Japanese government just decided to train more STEM students in their top universities.

Expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students graduated from U.S. universities, chances are U.S. companies can hire more qualified employees, and this is the only way to keep companies more competitive, providing even more job opportunities in the future.

Kicking out all F-1 Nonimmigrant students in STEM, possibly qualified employees will be lost and get hired by foreign competitors. How could US companies in STEM keep leading the world? If so, probably no job opportunity can be provided by companies as a result.
