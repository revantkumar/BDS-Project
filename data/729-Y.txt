Dear Sir/Madam

I fully support this regulation. The reasons are as follows. 

1. A lot of STEM international students are highly intelligent. It's very beneficial for American economy if these students can work for American companies. This will keep American economy rise at a high pace.

2. There are a lot of jobs that Americans are not good at but international students are. It makes way more sense to have these students do the jobs.

Thanks for your attention.
