Susvith Reddy In some schools MIS is considered as a STEM course and in other schools as non STEM course (MBA course). I request to consider the consider major degrees which are actually a STEM course but doesn't fall it in. There are so many international students who wants to perceive dreams and come to US to explore their knowledge in specific majors. With in the US if a single major MIS falls in different categories from school to school leaves student in an awful situation. I would request you to consider these major degrees as well in STEM.
