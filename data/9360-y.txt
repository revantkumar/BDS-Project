Raphael Elul This regulation, and similar other regulations have a demonstrable adverse effect on salaries and available positions of current American
Technology workers.

More important, however, the stifling effect these regulations have on future generations of American technical workers: It makes 
it more difficult, and in many instances near impossible for new Bachelor, Masters and even Doctoral graduates, to get entry-level 
positions in Industry and Finance: Rather than spend time in ramping up entry-level hires, companies prefer to hire foreigners
who already have additional education.

The result is that American youth find themselves excluded from the technical work market, creating a vicious circle that provides 
employers with spurious justification to petition for more and more foreigners, "because they cannot find the right manpower".

An even more insidious effect of importing foreign STEM workers is that inadvertently we have imported their cultural biases. For 
example, Information Technology derives at least 75% of its technical workers from the Indian Subcontinent, and these 
workers function effectively only in a "caste" system. AS a result we have seen over the last 10 years job requirements become more 
and more narrow. Where 10 years ago there were perhaps 5 Information Technology specialties, now we have close to 50. There is no 
more the "can do" attitude that used to characterize American workers and scientists, even more that their European peers.

The net result is that in the future we are less likely to see parallels to the Wright Brothers and Thomas Alva Edison and 
similar
American Originals..
