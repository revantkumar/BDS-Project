I, personally, strongly support the new OPT extension rule. The OPT extension is one of the most appealing reasons that top students come to American for further learning. Top students are not only contributing to U.S. academic sector, but also hi-tech industry. F-1 students with OPT act a very important role in hi-tech companies all over the country.

24-month OPT extension is proper for both students and companies, since the project are normally 2 years. It would be a big loss for the company if the employee has to leave U.S. for OPT reason.

F-1 students are not illegal immigrant. We are holding valid VISA and paying for our tax. For most foreign students, our families are not in U.S.. Therefore, we will be going back to our own country, after we get training in US.
