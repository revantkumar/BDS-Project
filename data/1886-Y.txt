Prudhvi Vatala I approve of this new rule and am hopeful it gives a lot of foreign students an opportunity to hone and apply their skills in STEM fields. The extension gives the foreign students to acquire more practical knowledge that they can then take home with them. Influx of skilled workers, especially in domains like STEM, can and will only lead to more innovation and thus more jobs.
