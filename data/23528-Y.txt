It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. 

The STEM students have honored this country with their support and with their friendship. Indeed, I can proudly say that I am an international PhD student in STEM. I can state from my own knowledge and experience that the international STEM students are among the most loyal, most law-abiding, patriotic, hard working people in this land. And it would be a shame, if the country doesn't give them more opportunities to stay and work after graduation. In the past 50 years, the international students graduated in science, technology, engineering and math have been pioneers in building and defending our great nation. They are the salt of the earth, and they're one of the backbones of this country.
