Many HR with employers and supervisors at international student services center on campus are still unfamiliar with the e-verify program, thus tudents cannot get sufficient guidance on how to collaborate with employers and school for OPT extension. 
For many students whose U.S visa expired, they are seriously afraid of visiting out of the U.S during OPT even though they have job offer letter and are working Because they might end up with trouble renewing visas for them to get back to states. Theoretically, OPT students are still with F1 visa. Strongly recommend a clarification on whethert students within OPT period and its cap-gap (file H1B in April, and OPT expires between April to October) could feel free to visit outside the U.S and would not have any trouble with renewing F-1 visas with sufficient documents.
