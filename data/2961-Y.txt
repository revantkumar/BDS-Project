Shan Wu I totally support this rule. Hope it will be published soon.

1. As an international student before, one of the reasons why I choose U.S. rather than other counties, like U.K., Canada is that here in America it has the opt program. It can not only help me gain knowledge but also gain work experience. Without the OPT program, lots of international students including me will not come to U.S. since the tuition and stipend here is much higher than many countries.

2. "International students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to NAFSA's latest economic analysis." (http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/eis2014/USA.pdf) Attracting more international students will create more jobs and contribute to the economy. OPT extension program will be a good method to do this.
