The increase in OPT STEM Extension period from 17 months to 24 months is a valid and necessary move which will be appreciated by every professional on STEM Extension.
After 2 decades of focused effort to encompass and amass knowledge in a specific field, every student in STEM deserves high quality practical training and experience. And there is a strong reason why it should be in USA, the reason is that the education is tailored specifically to cater to the industry requirement of USA.
Apart from the increased time period for gaining work experience, it also provides resources to pay back the huge student loans, give back to USA in the form of income tax as well as supporting the US economy. There is one very important reason why this move is very beneficial, that reason is generating jobs in the US and in other parts of the world. These professionals with quality education and quality experience are more than capable of starting new businesses which will further generate new job opportunities.
On reading comments posted by others, I have realized that I have to agree with them that there is a concept of supply and demand when it comes to jobs, but most jobs that STEM Extension affects are the ones which require an MS or PhD. The number of students with MS or PhD are very limited and these students donot affect the job prospect of students with BS(mostly US citizens). Where it is a fact that almost all the students pursuing MS or PhD are international students and they compete among themselves for jobs which require MS or PhD as a minimum qualification.
