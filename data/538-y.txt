Nancy Zhang I am fully supportive of this decision as I believe this is a mutual benefit for international students and the country. Just pick whatever medium to large size high tech company you can name and see how much contributions are made by those talented people. I'm not say international students are smarter, but no one can ignore their effort and contribution to the country. As it is, STEM extension is definitely a smart move!
