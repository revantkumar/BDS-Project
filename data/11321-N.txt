The U.S. government needs to stop pandering to foreign and corporate interests but instead must protect the people whom it has sworn to protect. If there is truly an insufficient number of American students to cover American demand, the U.S. government should encourage practical and true improvements to the education system here and provide preference for Americans over non-Americans in admissions. Interference by the U.S. government thus far has only made things worse, higher admissions costs for Americans, poorer quality education overall starting with elementary schooling, etc. The U.S. government needs to stop experimenting with the lives of Americans in all aspects, including especially education, faith, work, and health. We are not your guinea pigs. You have no authority other than that of a thug to impose these destructive policies upon us.
