I'm a MFA Industrial Design Candidate of Academy of Art University. I really hope that our OPT for students who are struggling in design field could last 24 months long. Design is the hardest field in U.S. We worked our ass off to build our skills. There is no weekends at all. We study in school and we are living in there! I think we are deserved to get a chance to last our OPT 24 months. Appreciate that.
