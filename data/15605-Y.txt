I strongly support STEM extension, as it would help Organizations some more time to find real talent among F1 students. 

If there is no STEM extension, then there will be very short time for candidates to prove their talent. Short period of OPT without STEM extension might not give opportunity to the candidates, forcing them to go to their home country, hence missing the real talent. 
F1 students with talent will prove beneficial to the organization and ultimately to the society and US economy.
