I fully supported the OPT extension proposal for the sake of U.S. people for the reason below.

Although increasing the lengths of OPT for stem students may result in thousands of positions occupied by 'foreigners', it dose not mean that U.S. people will tend to lose those jobs correspondingly. On the contrary, U.S. peole DO GAIN More JOBS because of keeping those stem students here. 

Why? It is because stem student come from field of science and engineering and mainly make contributions to boosting the advanced industry and industry in U.S. When those huge ares grow well, it will offer more chances in service, sales, technology, finance, as well as the similar positions in industry to U.S. people, while at the same time will not impact U.S. people from seeking the same positions as stem students do due to the cost of sponsorship for foreign students.

So, please approve the proposal for a better U.S. as well as a better life for U.S. people!
