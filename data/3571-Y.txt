I support and believe this proposal is necessary for US companies to retain skillful employees who are contributing to the US economy and creating job opportunities. If STEM extension does not get passed, tens of thousands of workers will be forced to leave the country immediately and sabotaging on-going researches and developments US companies are doing. Plus those workers will be working for countries that are directly competing with US and further increases the unemployment rate in the US. The first step of creating more job opportunities is to GROW THE ECONOMY and undermining companies' abilities to obtain skillful worker is not going to help at all.
