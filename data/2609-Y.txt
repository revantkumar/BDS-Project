I STRONGLY support the proposal to expand training period for STEM F-1 international students.

The reason is simple: Nowadays, the US economy has been mainly driven by Tech companies which create and produce cutting-edge products and services to the world. And international employees on OPT compose a significant portion of people working in US tech companies. 

If those people were forced to leave the US because of some STUPID visa issues, the impact to US tech companies and the US economy was immeasurable. 

It is not only a huge loss on the US side, it's also a huge gain on US companies' opponents side. If deported by the US due to visa, those talented international STEM employees would have to work for US opponents with the valuable experiences they got from US tech companies. 

If the US lost the lead in creativity,what else could we have to boost the economy?what else could we bring to the world saying we are still No.1 country in the world? Nothing!

If anyone wants the tech companies to hire more Americans, propose an educational reform! The average US STEM education before college (or including college, arguably) just SUCKS! That's why the US cannot produce enough American engineers to power the creativity we display for now. US tech companies need to hire brilliant international STEM talents to keep them on the lead.

So, STOP ascribing a problem to a WRONG group of people! Without international STEM talents, US economy and tech companies would have long ago lost its place in the world! 

In the time of economic uncertainties, we need more talents to power US technological innovations to generate money, convenience and leadership to this world. If those talents come from outside the US, let it be! DON'T STOP THEM! That's the power that has shaped America till today. That's what America really IS.
