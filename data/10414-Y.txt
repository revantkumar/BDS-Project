Mark McKowen I graduated with two STEM degrees and couldn't find any job other than retail after 3 years. I took those jobs to make ends meet. Even now, after 12 years, although I am gainfully employed, I am working in a COMPLETELY different field than what I went to school for. As a result, I am expanding my skill set with more schooling yet again (this time in pursuit of a 3rd STEM credential). After saying this, do you really think that it would be wise to allow foreign graduates to take jobs that National Americans are having trouble in finding? ...or are you being told to do this?
