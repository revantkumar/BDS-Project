Firstly, thank you, Homeland Security Department, for proposing the new rule of training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students, which means F-1 students potentially have more time and opportunities to get career training after graduation from colleges. I would sincerely support this proposed rule for the following reasons:

1. U.S.A embraces talents from all over the world for the past several decades, which effectively support US universities financially as well as their competitiveness compared to other universities around the world. 
2. These talents after graduation with advanced degrees possess unique skills which is useful for America's economy development for sure. It will not necessarily compete with US workers, in the opposite, due to the development of the specific area from contribution of talented foreign workers, more and more jobs will be created for US workers.
3. Long time and rigorous career training after graduation in US will definitely enrich and help F-1 student career development. These students prepared for further career development will help US to be a better place, or make better other places around the world.
4. Lose it or keep it! US has been losing these talented people due to the rapid development of developing countries, like China and India. So please let these talents stay and make contribution for US!

Overall, these legal and talented F-1 student deserved such opportunity of OPT-extension up to 24 months, and the proposed rule would be a win-win for both nonimmigrant students and Americans.
