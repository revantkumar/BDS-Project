Jason Power It is obvious that the proposal of OPT extension would greatly help the booming of US economy as well as the development of technology.

I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering of SUNY, and I find that almost 3/4 of my classmates are international students. There is no doubt that those international students would make a great contribution to the development of mechanical industry in US. If the OPT extension is canceled, this could be a big shock to the high-tech company in US. I even could not image what the industry would be without contribution of those diligent students. Even though I know that I would face a rat race in job market, I would SUPPORT the proposal for the well-being of US.
