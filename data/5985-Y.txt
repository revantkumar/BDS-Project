Sai Bal Reddy Cheruku I feel privileged in writing my opinion towards the STEM Extension. 

I at first strongly support for this rule and would be very much happier to see it implemented. I strongly believe that International students are not taking the jobs from the fellow Americans. United States have a strong requirements of workers in many fields which cannot be fulfilled just by the people of the Country. The country has grown very big and is still growing. To keep the country growing a lot of man power and talent is needed. 

The best idea would be to retain students from different countries who came to this country for education, as they would get used to the American work culture and it would be very much easy for them to handle the situations efficiently in their work place rather than bringing someone else from outside. 

On adding a boost to my comment, we ask our selves a question that, do Americans are really jobless and International Students are really taking their jobs and I would answer "NO" for this question. The United states is so much expanded that the Citizens alone cannot do all the work. Help is needed and the better way to get it is by implementing this rule.

Hope this rule gets implemented. God bless United States of America.
