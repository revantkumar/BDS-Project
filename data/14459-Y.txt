Foreign students utilizing OPT compete with American students for jobs in the U.S. marketplace. I work at a university and I find from talking to American grad students in high tech fields that they are having trouble getting jobs upon graduation. Some of this is because of the undue competition they face with foreign students in the job market. Why do we hobble american students in this way? We should be helping them, not fighting them. The H-1B program has already forced U.S. students into more needless competition & drives down wages. Many American students need decent jobs to pay off their student loans they've acquired. We should help OUR own students first. 

Some will say "Well, we (U.S.taxpayers) pay for the foreign students' education already - we have an investment there." (It's true that we fund their educations - they do not pay their own way), but two wrongs don't make a right. In years gone by the foreign student came, acquired his education and skill and then, returned home to make his own country a better place. The developing world needs all the doctors, engineers and scientists it can get. We are causing a brain drain thru OPT & H-1B. Unfortunately, the foreign students are far more interested it getting 100k American salaries than in helping the people back in their home countries.

We should definitely discontinue the OPT program which is in place because American corporations want to pay lower salaries for graduate degrees than the marketplace currently allows. OPT should be ended.
