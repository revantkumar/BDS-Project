As the parent of two students now in college, I am strongly opposed to this rule. The effect of the proposed extension will be to make it far more difficult for my children to find a decent job when they graduate, thanks to the competition they will face from foreign students willing to work under any conditions and for any salary in order to remain in the U.S. and eventually change their visa status. This is just one more example of how the federal government is pandering to the demands of big multi-national corporations who only value American kids when they want to fight a war. 
The news is full of reports about STEM graduates who have to take jobs at McDonalds or waiting tables because they cannot find employment in their fields. How can anyone defend this rule?
