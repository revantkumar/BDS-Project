I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. It does not only encourage the culture diversities in US, but is also crucial to the economic conditions in US. The economic development of US highly relies on the development of high-tech companies. Graduate international students contribute a lot to these high-tech companies, and in this way they are making a significant contributions to the GDP of US.
