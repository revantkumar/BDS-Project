I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 

I was an international Electrical Engineering master student from China and now a Hardware Engineer at Oracle. Before I came to US, I had several choices to pursue my Master's degree. ( US, Canada, France etc..) One of the reason why I choose USA is that the US is having this OPT extension rule that allows international students to gain more experience.

Not only the company I'm working at, but also all the high tech companies, who are hiring international students, and absorbing the intelligence all over the world to maintain their competence. In short term, the company are losing large portion of their employees immediately, and lots of ongoing projects can not go on, which will cause financial problems to the company. Long term wise, those tech companies may slowly loose their competence. As a fact of semiconductor industry, the leader in the industry can get almost 98% of the revenues from the market. And we all understand how bad it will be if the company lost the competence in the market.

Finally, as a residence in California, I know that the tax that OPT students paid is also a big amount of Federal and CA state income. If we start to lose international students, the bad economical effect taken on high-tech compani
