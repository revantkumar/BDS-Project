Thanks for helping indian and other students for making OPT rule. I already expressed my opinion on OPT and gave clear picture on it but according to my research I done Indian students have extreme knowledge and very hard workers if they want to gain the success they will for sure and it helps the American economy as well.
so, I hereby requesting DHS to make 24 months OPT rule implemented and it helps the indian students and other abroad students to share their knowedge with american IT industry for enormous growth. We americans are happy and pleasure to work with indian and other abroad candidates.

God bless united states of america!!
