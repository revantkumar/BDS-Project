Mingshi Peng Im a potential student of the STEM program and I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Part of the reasons why Im choosing the US over other countries to further my education is that it originally offers 17(36 would be much better) months extension after completion of my program, which would allow me to have enough time to get better training in the working market. These experience would help me become more competitive when I go back to my home country. Thus if this proposal goes thorough, then the universities in the US would be able to attract more international students and become more competitive.

2. Many STEM industries in the US rely greatly on the overseas students, especially the Chinese and the Indians. One reason why American IT companies can stand on the top of world is that these companies(Google, Microsoft, Apple etc.) are always absorbing the most brilliant minds in the world, regardless of their nationalities. Thus had the proposal been rejected, it would be a disaster to these industries.

3. Competition sure exists, but it may not be a bad thing. I dont see why a employer would prefer hiring a OPT student rather than a US citizen if they are equally qualified. One should compete,rather than simply ruling out all the other competitive competitors, in order to become competitive, and this competition will eventually benefit the US labor market, since the people would be more competitive.
