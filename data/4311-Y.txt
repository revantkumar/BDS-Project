The people who gave negative comments here have a same theory, I cannot find
job, because there are a lot of foreigners, who is better than me, are also
on job market. If they all gone, I will be the best, and I should be able 
to find a job easily. Is it good for a country to lose a huge number of well
educated, smart, and creative talents? Everybody knows what that means to a
country. Shame on you, you put your motherland under risk only because you 
want to find a job without making extra effort to improve yourself. Why don
t you learn something, try hard work? I dont believe if you as good as 
any working foreigner, you cannot find a job!
