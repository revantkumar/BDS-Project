So much has been done to promote education here and students are going heavily into debt. Instead of paying a fair wage they want to do temporary guest worker permits and visas. No benefits saves money. We don't need to outsource our labor, hire from within from all those with technical skills that are having to work elsewhere because they could not find opportunities and working in different reals than where their skills are in.
