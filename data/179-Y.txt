Caroline Brown I completely support this policy. I am a HR from an IT company, and every year we hire a lot of nonimmigrants new-grad students. They are smart, capable and without them I couldn't imagine how hard our work would be to hiring such a high demand of software engineers. 

Every year the H1B lottery matters a lot to these employees; there is a high chance that they won't be selected for H1B for the first year, but they is supposed to given another chance by being able to expanding the STEM opt. They are valuable employees for our company. We don't want to see them leave just because of something they couldn't control. 

I fully support improving and expanding the training opportunities for F1 nonimmigrant students!
