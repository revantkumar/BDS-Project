Steve Harnnman We should support this!!! We use a lot of tax payer's money to train them how to work, and then send them back to their own countries and compete with the US? Noway, that's not to our best national interest. Please stop the old rule, better extend all majors OPT, not only STEM. We need them to work for the US, to make the US continue to be the NO.1 country in the world for another hundreds years. They will work for us, help creating more jobs for us, and pay a lot of taxes. We need them to stay longer.
