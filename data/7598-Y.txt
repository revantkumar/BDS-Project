PING QIU I do strongly support this rule. The United States is a nation of immigrants.It's traditional American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And F-1 students who come to US to study deserve more chances and time to practice their skills after graduation. Inrernational students spend high tuition fees and living expenses, which also benifits to the U.S. economy growth and create more job opportunities.
