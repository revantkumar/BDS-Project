John Thompson I feel that we need to take care of our own people first. The kids we have going to college to get an education to better themselves and our country deserve to be the first ones considered for a job, it is sad that our children have to fight with non citizens to get a job. That is not what our founding fathers would want to be happening. It is time we stand up and take our country and rights back for all our kids. Our kids have a huge dept to repay for going to college, and they can not pay this back if they can not get a job because a company would rather hire a someone that isn't a citizen. Our children are the ones that need these jobs not the foreigners. Most of the foreigners get a free education and there for have no dept to repay,but our children let's give the jobs to our kids and let the company's have a little break for a couple of yrs. For hiring an american and helping our country grow stronger instead of seeker. So the tax brake that is given for foreigners should he given for our children who have done everything in there power to better themselves and our country. I owned a small business and not at any time did you he gov. Say okay you get a tax break,but if I had been a foreigner then I wouldn't have had to pay taxes for seven yrs. Really I am an american how come I didn't get a break for trying to independent person. Yes I got a few breaks but nothing like someone just coming to this country and buying a business. We need to get our priority's in the right way and take care of our own. Instead of the rest of the world. Our kids wouldn't be as far in dept and would be able to repay these loans that they took out to better themselves and our country. Thank you
