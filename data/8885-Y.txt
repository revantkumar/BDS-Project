I support STEM program by following reason. this program will bring a lot of advantages to America.

1. As we know, STEM program only works on F-1 nonimmigrant students who study in specific field, such as engineering, science, math and hi-tech. Those area need a lot of outstanding people to contribute. F-1 nonimmigrant students will make up for staff shortage. 

We are talking about high-tech area, people who works on those area should have long term professional education. those outstanding people will promote america scientific and technological progress and innovation. I am not sure if we have plenty of outstanding people shortage once we cancel STEM program, because most nonimmigrant students occupy our high level education.

2. According to the statistic by BBC New: The United States attracts the most international students, according to the Institute of International Education, with 691,000 students studying abroad in the US during the 2009 to 2010 school year. Of students who study in the US, the majority go to California, New York and Texas, respectively. The worlds second most popular study-abroad destination is the United Kingdom.

If we has STEM to attract more and more nonimmigrant student, most university will have enough money to do research and create more position for U.S citizen.
