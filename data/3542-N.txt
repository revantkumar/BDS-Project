Anyone paying attention knows that the Optional Practical Training Program is a seemingly noble intention that is paving the road to hell. There are so many problems with OPT that I won't have the space to list all of them. It may sound good, but in practice it provides incentives for American companies to lay off American workers in the STEM fields and higher cheap foreign replacements. I am a 55 year old professional who has watched my employers repeat this practice at every opportunity. And no wonder. OPT employees are younger and cheaper. Employers avoid the social security tax on their income. It encourages younger foreign professionals who should be going back to their home country to stay in the US indefinitely, rather than return and help to improve their own country. It provides bonuses to American companies that hire foreign workers but doesn't provide for the same bonuses for hiring US citizens starting in the workforce. It is a reason that workers in the IT field have seen stagnant wages for 10 years. Wouldn't it be great if US citizens got some of these perks to help improve their odds for employment, help the economy and get out of the chronically unemployment line? This program is a ruse, bought and paid for by corporations seeking cheaper foreign labor. Watch the video and then ask yourself if these immigrants are just taking the jobs Americans won't do.
