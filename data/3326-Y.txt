This new regulation is GREAT for US economy. International STEM students are potential entrepreneurs and innovators. More than 75% patents at the top 10 patent-producing US universities (76%) had at least one foreign-born inventor (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/research/patent-pending-how-immigrants-are-reinventing-the-american-economy-2/).
