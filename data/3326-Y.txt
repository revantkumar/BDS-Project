Brian Behling I strongly support this policy, its going to be mutually more beneficial for both the international students who are talented and the US.

OPT stands for Optional Practical Training, it is designed for F1 nonimmigrant students to be authorized to work for up to 12 months as an opportunity to gain practical experience of what they learned in the universities before going back to their home country.

This benefit attracts many international students to pursue their higher education in America rather than in other countries, although they are paying a lot for the tuition. The tuition from international students consists a considerable amount of universities income. Among the international students, only those talented can be qualified to accomplish their degree and contribute to their research projects at school. Their knowledge, innovative ideas, and diligent effort are invaluable assets for their affiliated institutions.

OPT is a great program that allows international students to contribute their talents to the country that educated them. However, 12 months are a very limited time for the students, and especially those in STEM majors to fulfill their responsibility at work or in a research team, so to pursue an OPT extension after the 12 months became a successful solution since 2008 to enable those talented people to continue serving for their obligations. In addition, the prosperity of STEM fields may also attract more American students to major in STEM, which makes them more competitive in the job market.

Nowadays, there are emerging trends of STEM international students bring investments from their home country, and some of them found startup companies, which create more working opportunities to the rapid developing tech eco-system that promotes US economy growth.
