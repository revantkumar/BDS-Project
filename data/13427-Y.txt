Many comments mention that foreign students "take jobs from Americans". This is a very flawed logic, especially for jobs that need highly skilled workers.

Let's think about this: let's say there are 1000 pianists perform in the US a year, 500 of whom are foreigners. If you block all the 500 foreign pianists, will there be another 500 American pianists play in their place? No, because they are not as good as the 500 foreign pianists, and people would choose not to go listen to them play. At the same time, the Americans that are hired to support these concerts lose their jobs.

Similar here, many students using OPT are doing things that need skills that are accrued in years of training. They are not "taking jobs". On the contrary, they are creating jobs because of the values they create by doing their jobs.
