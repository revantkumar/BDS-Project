I highly SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. For one thing, it is the best way for those international students to make contribution to the US society. By working here, international students can transfer all the knowledge and skill to real value to benefit the society. I believe in US high education system that they attracts and brings in the best students to US universities. I don't see why the government or the natives will want these educated young people to leave the county after graduation and lose the opportunity to repay the society, to use their knowledge to make this county a more dynamic and competitive place. Give them a chance, to work here, to create profit, to build cool stuff, to make this place better than ever.
For another, US is founded on diversity. And it continues to attracts talented, skilled and best people from all over the world. And I'll say that international students should be the best target. They are young and promising, they are motivated to work hard, they are legal, and most importantly, they are educated here and share the American spirit.
