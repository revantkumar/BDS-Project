Currently, there are thousands of companies that have international students working on OPT extension status. If OPT extension has been invoked, these students will lose their F1 status immediately which can causes billions of dollars lost in the US. 

Some people said that they cannot find a job because that international students accept lower pay rate. This is not true. Most of company will hire international students is only because that they cannot find enough qualified people for this certain position such as in IT industry. 

Also, a lot of international students choose to study in the US instead of other countries because they have an opportunity to train and practice what they've learned in the university here. If the OPT extension has been invoked, this country will lose many potential students since less and less foreign students would be likely to come and study here. And since international students have created billions of income each year for the US education and economies, OPT extension should really be supported and continued.
