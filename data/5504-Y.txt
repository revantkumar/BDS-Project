I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

OPT does not grant a working opportunities to a foreign, it's providing a chance/possibility for a STEM student to seek for a job after school to gain practical experiences. Still, the foreign student need to go through the same interview/test/screen processes as U.S citizens and those employers shall pick the ones that performs better among those students, no matter where he or she is from. The unqualified ones, no matter foreign students or citizens, will have to work harder to stand a better chance. With that said, this proposal shall NEVER be interpreted as "depriving" or "granting" working opportunities to anyone. Those citizens with qualified skills, will never lose the chance, whatever the OPT program is doing. Those who are thinking some positions are "offered" to foreign students instead of citizens are completely wrong.

Foreign students need to work extremely hard (and usually, much harder than the citizens) to get a chance to compete with the citizens. This raises the bar for the employees and thus our industry can get the best people all around the world (not only the best citizens) and always stand in a leading position. This will in turn providing a better overall industry and working opportunities to all those living in the state. I don't want to see a trend where our country is becoming less open and losing its spirit.
