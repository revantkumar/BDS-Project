OPT extension is obviously a must for U.S and Americans and I support that. Those who say OPT extension is killing their job opportunities are just base on their interests and in fact do not make senses. In the long run, absorbing the workforce from oversea students can boost up the economic development of US and create more job opportunities. Most F-1 students are elites in their fields with outstanding skill set, which will potential bring inestimable benefit to the country.
