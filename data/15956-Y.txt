I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Im a PhD student of chemical engineering, and this is my first year coming to America. I find American students consist a small portion of new PhD students in my department. That is to say, without international students, U.S. will be lack of chemical engineers in the future which is bad for the development of this country. Whats more, competition between American and international workers does exist, but is not that a bad thing. People can be pushed to improve themselves because of competition. If people just stay in a comfortable environment, they couldnt think about working hard, and will not contribute to the development of USA.
