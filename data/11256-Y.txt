I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. It definitely benefit not only F1 students but also US citizens, and US economy:

US economy needs STEM employers while local students are not willing to take these positions. As is known, the proportion of international students of STEM majors is larger than that of US students in college. If these people can not serve the US industry, the industry will be weaken. 
Actually, most F1 students applying for OPT extension are not because they want citizenship in US. They do so because, as the original purpose of OPT, they want to get training in US industry. For STEM major, 3 year is an enough experience for the first job. These international students can get advanced working experience while contribute to US economy, and then go back to their country. As they go back to their country, it is reasonable that they will take more important position(due to their US experience) and be much more friendly to US. Therefore, they could contribute more to the US. I think it is much better for the US than if F1 students are kicked out of the country almost as soon as they graduate(after spending a lot of tuition).
