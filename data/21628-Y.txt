When International Students travel to USA and complete there education here the contribute significantly towards the Economy of the USA in various forms. 
For getting a Master's degree on an average a student spends about 30,000 $ as tution fee's and add another 20,000 for accommodation and stuff. 
So, If a student is spending around 50,000 in less than 2 years to obtain a degree from USA why shouldn't they be given a chance to learn and earn in OPT PERIOD.
Hence OPT should be provided to them as they can gain some practical experience and apply with in there countries after travelling back.

I support OPT 24 month rule.
