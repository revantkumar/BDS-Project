I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government must be aware of the importance of putting things into practice. Students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities need the chance to stay in the country and keep making contributions to the U.S. U.S. needs more people to do these jobs to help the country run in a better way.

2. Diversity is one of the most essential things U.S insist, giving up the OPT is the same as asking all the talented people to go out of U.S. only due to their different races or citizenships. Why not ask their willingness about staying? Most of the people would like to make contributions to U.S. And many of them made BIG one!

3. Competition help the country to develop. The extension does not mean letting all the international students to stay and own the benefits from the country. Only the talented one, the one with special skills that U.S. needs can stay. The government already have a complete and efficient way of selecting people to work in different industries. DON'T WASTE the previous endeavor and drive away those people that U.S. needs
