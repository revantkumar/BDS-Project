I strongly recommend this being approved.

First of all, foreign STEM students worked so hard in US universities and always had the wish to contribute what they learned to US. They are one of the major forces that cannot be lost. 

Secondly, if this proposal was rejected, it would have significant effect on future foreign students' interest in coming to USA for further study. And their existence help US's economy both now and in the future. Their consummation in goods and apartment renting market could be a positive factor for US employment rate.

What's more, diversification is always honored by every one in USA. then why would it be different when it comes to foreign students and workers?

To summarize, approval of the expanding proposal would bring more benefits to both USA and its people.
