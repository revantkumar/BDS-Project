I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. From my point of view, new OPT extension rule certainly help to achieve a win-win situation for both U.S. and international STEM students. 

First of all, to keep U.S. academic sector to remain the competitive edge, attracting outstanding international students is one of the important action. I think there is no need to re-emphasize the advantages to bring in more talents to U.S. academic sector globally. As one of the international students, I made my decision to come to U.S. pursuing my graduation study based on a few factors. I believed U.S. academic sector could provide excellent resources to not only help me better diving deep into the field I am interested in, but also provide a chance to apply what I learn to practice where OPT extension rule comes in and play an important role. Such practical opportunity is as important as the education opportunity. That's also why I didn't choose U.K and some other countries that are not able to provide such practical opportunity with a reasonable time length. 

In addition, I'm one of the STEM students and I've already start my first job in a company with sectors all around the world using my OPT extension. If the extension rule was cancelled, that would be a disaster for me and cause a great loss for my company too ( many other international students was hired in the company). I believed my company, just like many other U.S. companies value a lot the international talents. Company is growing internationally and there's projects that may involve different countries, under such circumstance, international workers like me would provide valuable knowledge/experiences, or even just better communication using their native language.
