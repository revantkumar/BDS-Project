I strongly oppose the 'Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Elegible F-1 Students. I know that most of the world is facing difficult times, now, but I believe that each country should devote their resources to helping their own citizenry in order to recover. There are many countries and many people of other countries who live by a very different code of ethics than that which the United States of America has always ascribed to. I know that Americans, in general, care very deeply for others in the world, but because we have overextended this support(among many other mistakes in the management of world and national concerns), we now find our own country in very poor economic and moral condition. Please realize that we must support valuable education and strengthening of our own young people in order for our country to heal.
