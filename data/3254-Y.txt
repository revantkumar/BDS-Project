I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Since US need a lot of international students to do professional works. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country. I think foreign STEM talents will creat more and more benefit in the future. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous work experience at XXX, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.

Hope more people support this good rule!
