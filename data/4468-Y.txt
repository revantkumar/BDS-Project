Yun Cao I totally SUPPORT this rule for the following reasons:

1. This rule can retain more talents to improve the economy of America, and hence will BENEFIT EVERYONE. I saw some comments saying that this policy would be a detriment to American tech workers, because this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. BUT I have to say I am not agree with that opinion. Economy of a country is like a pie. It has never been that some people are afraid of sharing this small pie with others. What we should do is absorbing more skilled people to make the pie bigger and bigger, so that everyone can get more pieces of pie. 

2. The extension rule can help American education system absorb more wonderful international students to study in America, and hence improve the competitiveness of the American education around the world. As an international STEM student, I chose to study in America two years ago, because I can work there for 29 months with my OPT. This extension policy is a very important point to absorb international students. Because one year is not enough for us to gain job experience. If U.S. cancelled that extension, she will lose a great amount of students resource. If we cannot get any benefit after graduation in America, why not choose other countries? So I think OPT extension can make Education of America more competitive!
