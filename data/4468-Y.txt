I agree with the 24-month OPT extension for F-1 STEM students for several reasons:

1. The purpose of this extension is to facilitate the development of the United States. From this point of view, it is never harmful to do exert the extension. The educational system enrolls the best students from all over the world, spends money and time on them and cultivates them to a better level. Then, US should take all means to have them. 

2. Some people would say that the policy will have negative influenence on US society. I stongly disgree that. US is established on immgration. Without immigration, the country won't be flourishing like this. Moreover, the policy aims to have people with high-education degree to have more time to work for US. No sign will indicate that the extension is not good.

3. If the extension no longer exists, many excellent international students probably will choose to stay in their own countries. In this way, US could lose the high ground of technologies. Think about this, Google, Apple and many other companies and research institutions, they couldn't be as powerful as they are now without STEM students.

In sum, my point is to agree with the 24-month OPT extension for F-1 STEM students. Having more high-educated people is a must. If problems happen because of this, they are the inevitable problems as the society progresses. But, by limiting the number of high-educated people, it is a sign of decline of a society.
