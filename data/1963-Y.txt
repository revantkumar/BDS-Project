I strongly SUPPORT this 24 month STEM OPT extension rule!

International students make up the majority of enrollments in U.S. graduate programs (some even exceeds 80%) in many STEM fields. They play a critical role in sustaining quality STEM graduate programs at U.S. universities. International STEM students bring tremendous value to U.S. economy after graduation as researchers and entrepreneurs. The U.S. has been benefited from their contributions. With a 24 month extension, the U.S. industry and academy have better chances to maintain these talented foreigners to continue their contributions.
