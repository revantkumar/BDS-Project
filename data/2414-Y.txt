Expanding the OPT for F1 international students is a necessary. OPT is great for skilled and hardworking international students to practice the skills learned in US. These gifted and hardworking noncitizen contributed a lot to the economy of the America, especially in the IT field. Sending all the F1 students who are under OPT now will be a big loss to the IT Company. If the expansion dont pass, it will discourage the international students to come to America. A developed country needs gifted immigrant. Most American were immigrant. Refused the skilled immigration violate the American spirit.
