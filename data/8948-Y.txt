OPT extension helps the country!

Obviously, OPT extension is good for the development of science and technology of the U.S. Science and technology are important for a country in the modern world. They provide a better life for all. No one could live without cars, cellphones and Internet now. As a result, it is important to encourage scientists, engineers and mathematicians to work for the U.S. Otherwise, they will help other countries to fight against America. America will definitely lose in the competition among different countries, if the country fails to create a better environment for scientists and mathematicians to work. That's a bad news for all Americans!
