In order to be a meaningful learning experience for students trying to get advanced degrees, a 24-month extension
combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is appropriate. This will continue to support the U.S. economy

Some of the misconceptions are 
- International students work at Lower wages or are Cheap Labor. This is not true. Companies pay them the same wages as any other employees. Also hiring fresh graduates to replace senior executives to save costs is a general trend among different companies, which will not change even if international students stop coming to the USA.

- Less jobs for the locals. This is not true. The scale of American economy/ IT industry is huge enough for every qualified individual to get a job. The fact that so many companies have their offices or outsource jobs to other countries reiterates this fact.

If the STEM OPT extension were to be cancelled 
- Outsourcing of jobs will increase tremendously, as companies fail to get workers with advanced degrees/ appropriate skills.

- There will be an economic slowdown/ recession for the USA economy, since the universities will stand to lose the fees they get from there students. Also different sectors like health insurance, Airlines, Auto, Housing, outlets, entertainment industries will suffer losses which might eventually reduce the jobs in the respective industries.

- Undergraduate students might end up paying higher costs, since universities stop getting funds from the international students, as no student would be willing to spend thousands of dollars over two years, with just 12 months of work authorisation. (It will be a financial disaster for any student willing to do so).

So this 24 month STEM OPT extension will definitely be a boon to the US economy & will see more skilled labor coming to the US for advanced degrees.
