An fi non immigrant is not an American citizen. In view of the current economic state of the country it is beyond unconscionable for any agency of the U.S. government to even consider any benefit, financial or otherwise, to be offered to any foreigner no matter the legal status. After Americas illegal immigration problem is resolved, the current fractured jobs market returns to normal levels and corporations are no longer allowed to take advantage of the reduced cost of hiring foreign workers over their American counterparts then and only then can initiatives such as this be considered on the merits. This, as proposed at this time, can only be considered as a sop to appease the corporate lobbyists that the political class is beholden to at the expense of an already struggling American work force. Do not do this.
