I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer science master student from China and was a software developer in Pfizer. I chose to study in US because US offers us a great opportunity for industry training opportunity. If there is no OPT or OPT extension, I would definitely choose some other country to pursue my degree. I believe a lot of students think like me as well. Thus US will lose a lot of foreign STEM students, who can be a very big supporting part of many huge technology companies such as facebook, linkedin, apple, google. I believe this will be a huge disaster to lots of companies as well as the economy of the US. Also, students like me hope to get like 3 or 4 years working experience here, then go back to home country. 1 year is absolutely not enough. What's more, foreign students pay a great amount of money for tuitions. This is also a boost of economy. In addition, OPT students often do those kinds of jobs which citizens seldom willing to do. We're not competing with US citizens. On the contrary, OPT students did a great contribution to the US industry! All in all, I don't see any benefit of cancel the OPT extension, it is not good for either the students or the US economy.
