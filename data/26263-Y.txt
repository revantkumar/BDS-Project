I completely support the proposed change in increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension term to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for the students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness. I hope this proposal gets accepted.
