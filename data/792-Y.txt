it is absolutely unfair to say that foreign students and workers take jobs from American people. Employers are those who have the power to hire people, and they will always hire the right people. If foreign guys can do more IT jobs, why would employers hire relatively less qualified candidates? And the same thing happens when it comes to some area where the American people show advantage over foreign guys, like business, art.
