I definitely support this rule. And the reasons are as follows:

1. It is the spirit of freedom which makes the America the largest country in the world and attracts so many people from all over the world coming to US, including me. And this rule absolutely is part of the sign of this spirit. Losing this, what else will make America the dream of the world?

2. The rule is good for me, but also benefits America a lot. The foreigners like me can contribute a lot to US economy. Most of us are talented and hard-working, effectively pushing America ahead and ranking the top in the world. More opportunity and more time to us means more benefits to American.

3. Diversity is important to US. We can bring different cultures from all over the world and merge them into the culture of America. That explains why America is so attractive, it is changing and getting much better!

4. More opportunities for us does not mean losing of the chances for American. We are not here to compete, we are here to create! We can bring much more to US.

I really wish this rule can be approved and America can get better and better.
