As a STEM grad student, I have three points to claim on the OPT issue.

First one: The USA is a country that fulfilled with opportunities, it is a country that known for freedom. I chose to come and study here in the United States not only because the high technology environment but also the chance to work in some world famous companies! I want to apply what Ive learn in a real scenario to test my abilities. If this chance gets cut off, why should I still coming here for my studies? These companies will also suffer from the loses. 

Second one: If the VISA duration is two short, there is no way to finish a research before the immigration department let you out. One example is I know a PhD study who recently came to a research lab in my school. He only has a one-year VISA and at the end, the research paper his team submitted for a submit was not able to go in deep with the analysis method they have used to show their results. Also, he is not able to attend the conclusion meeting after the having the result from the submit due to his VISA issue. This is real bad for a research person who couldnt know his mistakes after all tasks finished.

Third one: I will eventually go back to my countries simply because there are big potential market for what I have learnt here. It is obvious that China is growing and that is why a lot of companies have investigated in China. If I were stay in the United States, I will not hold strong to form my own business. All my connections from the last 20 years are still remaining in my own city. I can be strong enough to defeat my adversaries just after I gain enough experience in this developed country! And it is the core reason why I came here regardless how hard that is!
