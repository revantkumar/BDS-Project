Zhicheng Yue I strongly SUPPORT the extention of OPT. As a gruaduate student, I will spend 2 years here to learn knowledge in my field and I hope I can have enough time to practice in the industries. The training oppotunities time really matters a lot. Most F-1 students here are top students from their countries and these students can make great benifits to the US industries and US economics. The OPT is also one of the most important reasons why foreign students choose to study in the US.
