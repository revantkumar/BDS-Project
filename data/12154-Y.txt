Dear Ms. Katherine Westerlund,

As an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and graduated in 2014 with a masters degree in the field of computer science. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. 
Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.

I strongly commend for this 24 months rule and would urge that a clear path to ofabsorbing and benefiting from International 
graduates should be rolled out.
