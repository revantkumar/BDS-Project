Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am an international student working graduated from University of Maryland Baltimore County and currently working on OPT. Huge percentage of UMBC graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. I and many of my colleagues will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. Im particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

I am currently using my OPT and will be using OPT stem extension in future. OPT and OPT stem extension are important to me because they provide a chance to gain practical knowledge in my field of education.

I am very concerned with the possibility that the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I really appreciate the timely action taken by DHS and thank everyone of you for providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best regards,
Ketul
