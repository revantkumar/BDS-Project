Greetings! I am an international student and I feel the need to speak up observing many US citizen's negative comments on how we are taking away their jobs. 1. For STEM majors, most positions we are after, with all due respect, are not what some US citizens can or want to do. The jobs we do not only contribute to the US economy but also scientific and other academic fields. Quite contrary to taking away jobs, which no offense, was not why some US citizen are unemployed, it is precisely what we do that enables many US citizen to live with better social welfare, more advanced technology and stable economic environment. 2. OPT STEM students, like me, have received years of education in US. We are grateful for the amazing education environment and awesome academic atmosphere we enjoyed and we would love to give back to the society. It is our gratitude and appreciation that motivate us to apply what we learned and contribute to the very nation that welcomed us in the first place. 3. Historically, it is the accepting culture that paved the way to where US is today. It saddens me that the society shows little toleration to intelligent international students, who just like their forefathers, have been trying to contribute to the nation we love and care about. And so, my fellow Americans, we ask not what your country can do for us, we ask what we can do for your country! Thank you for the time reviewing my comment!
