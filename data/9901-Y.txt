Hi this is really good move, after completing 12 months of OPT period their is need for extension period for international students. When international student comes over here for higher studies they are expected to have some kind of training and work experiences from company. so this new rule of 24 month extension help US government, economy and international students. It will also be great if the OPT STEM extension is made for 36 months will help students and company in either way.
