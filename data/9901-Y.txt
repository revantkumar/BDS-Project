Thomas Dsouza Hi, 

I am supporting for OPT extension to 24 months for STEM. It will help us to our next step of getting H1B Visa. Currently H1B is going through lottery and it is really difficult and un-predictable that we will get through in one attempt. So even after doing higher studies (master's) and with Job from fortune company at hand we are not able to make it just because we don't have work visa. If the law is passed, it will help US country to retain talent and boost the economy.
