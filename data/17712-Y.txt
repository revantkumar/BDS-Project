By extending the OPT, we potentially give the higher-educated international students more time to stay in the U.S. to make contributions to this country. Instead of losing all these qualified people after educating them using our resources for all these years, keeping them here for further training and increase their chance of working for the U.S. seems a wiser option. And statistics has shown that they are not pushing Americans out of jobs. Instead, they tend to fill jobs that Americans cannot or will not fill, mostly at the high and low ends of the skill spectrum. Thus, I dont see any reason that this proposed rule shouldnt been passed.
