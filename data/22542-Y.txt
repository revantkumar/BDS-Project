I feel this is a great move. For the sole reason that, it would only positively impact the economy of the country. International students working on OPT bring in a lot of talent and expertise which in turn helps the country grow. With the OPT extension rule what will happen is the process to apply for further visas would be smoothly streamlined and people will not have to scramble for visas as soon as they get an OPT. This in turn will make the visa screening process smoother and help the DHS keep the right people in.
