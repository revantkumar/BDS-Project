I strongly hold the opinion that the opt should keep its extension as 24 month with following reasons. 

The H1B working visa process is really hard to apply, which means if we cancel the extension, most of the foreign engineers have to go back to their own country. This will very harmful for many industry. Such like I working for it industry, most of our engineers are from China and India. Without them, our company could not run as normal. Without these talents, many information technology company will bankrupt. You could just imagine, your life without Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and may other social media. You could also imagine, windows update 5 years latter, and iphone could not work well for a long time. This is not only relate to job opportunity, it also relate to this country's competition advance. 

To sum up, I strongly hold keep the extension of opt
