I support this rule and it will benefit this country for the following reasons:
1. because of longer OPT will attract more foreign students coming to study in US, and we know it's good for the economy.
2. in IT area, our country needs more talented engineers to work here. And we all hope that we'll stay No.1 in IT area.
3. It has no any relationship between the competition between OPT foreign students and local students.
