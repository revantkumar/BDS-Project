I think the New OPT extension is a very good rule for the States. Because USA is a country that full of chance. People who have ability can implements their dream at this place. International students can contribute more to US and the world because the education in US is No.1 in the world and the opportunities they can get are tremendous but not everyone can contribute their power in one step. They need time. So the New OPT extension expand the time for students to get more exercise by finding internship or job to do their best and then make profit for States and the world. So I strong SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule
