As an international student, I vote for extension for training opportunities for F1 students. It is a win-win policy for both US and international students. As an engineering student, I am highly involved in the STEM projects, and usually those types of projects take longer time for the final outputs. If the OPT period is extended, there could be sufficient time to move the projects forward. In return, the project output would benefit US related academic or industry fields. Meanwhile, I am happy to see Facebook, Uber and other high-tech companies are considering China as one of their focused market. When international students come back to their homeland, they could either find a job in these companies China branch or work in other companies have have business relationship with those. It would be great if international students have the chance to work in those companies with OPT period. They would have a clear understanding of how the company and product works. They could contribute to the company development in a general perspective. Last but not least, longer OPT period acts as one of the most important criteria for international students to choose the oversea universities.
