I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international undergraduate and graduate student from Ohio and Connecticut. I am working for Aetna Life Insurance company. I spent almost 6 year in the US. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my bachelor and master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Aetna, Travelers, Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.
