Mr. President not all children are as privileged as yours. My child will graduate college in 2016 with high hopes of finding a good job. There are millions of other moms hopping the same for their children, to find a good job. Why are you not protecting our children and their future? I hope your children face the same fate as mine if you choose to bring in all of these people that have no allegiance to the USA. Thank you for not caring for millions of your own!
