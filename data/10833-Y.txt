As an international student in STEM major, I would like to firstly thank US government take this step ahead. This step is meaningful and worth to be remembered not only for international student like me, but also for Americans. 

Why would I say that?

As a graduate student in statistic major, I have filled myself with lots of books and knowledge. In other words, I am well-educated. Let's not talk about the benefit in economy, work force that well-educated students bring to America first, let's talk about the legal consciousness and the respect we have to the constitution we have. STEM student or international student in all major from all of the world comes to the U.S. for the best education in the world, at the very first stage, people like me passed TOEFL and GRE without a native English Language benefit has shown their wish enough to be a better man/women, to pursue more knowledge and to live a better life. In that case, those people know how to hard work and take care of their behavior. We are part of the social safety contributor.

Secondly, America live on high-technology. Google, Amazon, Apple... I can list hundreds of the world best high-tech company founded by American people. Those huge companies need more and more STEM student to keep themself running on. 

This is the best time to make America step one more ahead. I believe in America!
