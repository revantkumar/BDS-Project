Marty Arnold I have 4-year-old twins. I worry greatly what future they will have in 18-20 years. Right now we live in Asia for my work. I can assure you that in South and Southeast Asia, where we've lived for the past 8 years, nobody - from the government down to the street - is talking about letting people from other countries take their jobs. On the contrary, they are very nationalistic and do everything to protect their workers and people, and put their jobs and economic welfare first.
Why don't we? This lie that we have to import workers from other countries because US citizens can't or won't do it must stop. And, PS, I am a life-long Democrat.
