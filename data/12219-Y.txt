First of all, I want to support this proposal.

As a STEM student, I think this proposal is very important and necessary part of the education. For STEM fields, you cannot get anything from the textbooks because STEM needs more practice. The OPT extension gives us more opportunities to get this missing part in the university.

And I think OPT extension will bring huge benefits to United States. First of all, this part of well-educated and trained students will fill the need for highly advanced technical workers in United States.

The OPT extension will not threaten the opportunities for US natives. Actually, to hire an international students, the company must pay more and do much more extra work. It's not cheap, but only more expensive. The only reason why the company needs this part of candidates is because this part of demand cannot be met. And due to the boost of economy, other related non-STEM fields and STEM fields will be more prosperous and more job opportunities will be created. So it is win-win proposal.

As a result, I strongly support this proposal.
