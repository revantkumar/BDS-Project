The reason why United States become the most powerful country in the world is because its open policy towards immigrants. The history of Silicon Valley have witnessed generations of smart young people aspiring to change the world, and I can see the young graduates from the STEM degrees becoming one of those future legendaries. US need the young talents to sustain its innovation in technology and they are the engine for the new economy. Therefore, I suggest the government should make a much friendlier policy toward those new immigrants, enforcing the STEM extension period should just be a start.
