I strongly believe that the OPT extension would be highly beneficial to the US.
With STEM OPT extension, many engineering companies have been expanded since 2008. Employers are able to hire more talent international students and have more chance to sponsor H1B visa. It can save employers a lot of money on the employee turnover.

The STEM OPT extension will not harm native students and American employees. First, American students are only a small percentage of STEM students.Second, almost all companies prefer native students than international students. They only hire international students when the American students are not sufficient.

In general, the extension of OPT would be a great help for the whole country.
