We need the OPT extension program.
That is one of the ways to keep the talents from overseas.
If we don't even give them an opportunity to show their talents with the OPT extension program, how can we evaluate the talents from over the world ?
If we lose those talents to countries like China and India, those talents will work for our competitors and will have a significant negative impact on our economy.
