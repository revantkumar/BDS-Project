Jian Li I am strongly support this regulation get approved.

It is very easy to reject any positive proposals, but it will take many years to recover from the bad impact. As bystanders, we are even more clear about what happened and is happening in USA, we know why USA is getting so strong and why USA gathers so many top talents, it is so easy to destroy it.

Please seriously consider that, only USA keeps strong, the people of USA can have better life.
