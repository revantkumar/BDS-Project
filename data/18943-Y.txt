Foreign students did not use American Tax dollars to learn and work in the United States. They contribute to our schools by paying out of state tuitions in cash, and they pay taxes when they work using CPT and OPT. 

Don't forget this country is built by immigrants. I don't understand why children of those hard-working immigrants can be so entitled. People, American or not, who has jobs in the STEM field got hired because they're the best at what they do. Every company claimed that they are Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer, that they do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color and national origin. No one disagree with that statement. Why did our policy makers keep discriminate against foreign born workers? 

OPT extension ensured that America is keeping the most skilled workers. Let them work, innovate, become successful and create more jobs! That is the true spirit of being an American.

This new enhancement on the OPT extension policy is good for our economy. VOTE YES!
