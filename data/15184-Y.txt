The OPT program has been a tried and tested way of bringing in and keeping talent within the United States of America. The OPT has been the reason why the US is the first choice among Chinese and Indian students seeking to further their skills and contribute to the Tech industry.

It is beneficial for the US IT Industry as well, as they are able to hire strong talent for a lower pay. Without the OPT extension, companies would start to lose talent and will end up paying a lot more for sub standard talent. I believe the 24 month extension is vital for the sustenance and growth of the US Tech sector.
