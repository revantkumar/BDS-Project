Half of our total technical employers are foreigners. Our company highly depends on those STEM students. If we don't give them OPT extension, we might lose those talents and our company will suffer huge losses. For example, our derivative team has three STEM students working with their OPT visa. They be responsible for valuing and hedging more than ten billion annuity. If they cannot apply for OPT extension, those thousands of policy holders will suffer huge losses. It is really difficult to recruit those technical talents who are good at math, computer science and finance. If those STEM don't have the eligibility for OPT extension. The United States will suffer more than those students.
