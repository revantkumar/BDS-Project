I agree with OPT extension act. 
As an employer, I want to see employee from different country, since they have different idea. And those people who can earn degree from US verified university are very excellent. They are not only contributing their knowledge to increase revenue for my company, but also become a good model for all other employee. I like them! I don't want to their leave due to any visa issue.
What more, I believe the OPT extension action will provide them a good opportunity to apply their skills, which are learned from school, in the real world and improve the whole community.
