I strongly oppose this regulation. International graduates do not deserve cap-gap relief since F1 student visa holders are not allowed to have "immigration intent". However, H1b working visa allows "immigration intent". Thus, for those F1 visa holders who have applied for H1b visa, they are allowed have "immigration intent". For this reason, it will be inappropriate to allow them to continue to work in the US on F1 visa, which is a visa disallows "immigration intent". Once the F1 visa holder have applied H1b visa, s/he should go back to her/his home country and schedule an H1b visa interview with the consular officer. 

Also, since regular H1b visa holders are only allowed to entry the US up to 10 days before the start date of work, it is totally unfair for people who have previous held F1 visa to have more privilege.
