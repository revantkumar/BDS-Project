I strongly support this new OPT extension rule!!!

This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both the F-1 non-immigrant students and the U.S. technology companies. Without this rule, the 1-year OPT can only guarantee students to work for U.S. companies for one year. Companies usually spend a few months in training a new employee and have to find a replacement in year. With this new rule, companies can hire an F-1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years which definitely will benefit production. If U.S. government can not retain those students with STEM degree after graduation, then that will only benefit other competing countries.

So make it real!! And make it real as soon as possible.
