I graduated with my PhD degree last year and thanks to the OPT policy I can now work in a US company. I am holding a critical position in the department and I really enjoy the daily work. My supervisor and other colleagues have been telling me what a great and hardworking person I am, and they are very thankful of the fresh thoughts and contributions I brought in. I have been discussing with my colleagues about this proposal, they ALL root for it. They think we are bringing good changes and ideas to the society, as well as healthy challenges to the native Americans instead of threatens.

Let's say, if the proposal fails, all the international STEM students like me need to go back to our home countries, then we make contributions to those societies. I believe even if we may have some anti-culture shock to at the very beginning, we can still succeed, because our experience made us tougher and stronger, made us more analytical and mature.

US has been considered as #1 country in the world, because US holds the most advanced technology. A diversity of people from all over the world was making that happen, those immigrant made the dream come true. Think about 10 years ago, does anyone have a vision of smart phone? A touch-screen computer? Do you know how many scientists and engineers from other countries were behind this? If US has the ambitious to stay outstanding in 20 years, the Americans need to welcome the high-educated people, the Americans need to give us the opportunities to build the country and make contributions.
