I support the STEM extension for foreign students. This extension allows US companies to invest in training a global workforce. Considering long term development, the extension allows for a greater return on investment for US companies. Regardless of whether or not the trained student stays in the US or returns to their home country after the OPT period, field training can yield more productive global citizens, who are needed to solve the world's greatest challenges.
