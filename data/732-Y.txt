Stem extension is important to students who study in the respected area. And those majors which the STEM covers have fewer domestic students enrolled than in other majors. However, the society do need people from those background for the jobs related, and I don't think domestic students are enough to fill the required amount. Therefore, it might be the way to ensure the supply those STEM jobs with immigrants. Removal of STEM extension may result in a great loss of immigrant people who work in these fields, and thus harming our own country.
