Zack Wong As a neutral observer (L1 visa holder) working in a silicon valley company, I may say something behalf of the manager level in high-tech business, which in many comments, has hired too many foreigners regardless of a high domestic unemployment rate in US. Every year we received thousands of job application from colleges. We strictly screen those candidates, pick good ones from the huge pool, make sure that we have got those who fit our culture and seem likely contribute to our growth. Though young men from India, China and other outside have more and more emerged around us, we manage to keep our culture unchanged, open, good balance between work and life, tech-driven. Every applicant has to prove themselves by their comprehensive qualities, not race, gender or citizenship. This is the internal power of the prosperity of silicon valley and other tech-driven industry in US. Now as more and more F-1 visa students graduated from colleges, the H1-B visa is more and more like a lottery for them. Just this year 6 smart young men have to leave here for not getting their visa to maintain their legal residency. Here I want to point out the proceedings of the project they are working in has been affected because of personnel change. It's unwise to keep these talented young men outside US. Instead the government should create a favorable environment for them. Their contribution in turn will lead to more employment opportunities in the short future.
