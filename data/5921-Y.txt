Hi, I am one of the student currently on opt. I am a good student with great GPA looking for good career opportunities further. It was very hard for my parents to send me to USA for my masters, since I am from a middle class background. And I need opt extension to learn more and more about my study area by working further and make my family feel happy for what I learned and worked here. I SUPPORT FOR OPT EXTENSION
