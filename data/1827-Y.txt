I strongly support the proposal of STEM OPT extension to 24 month. Many international students with STEM OPT don't take away the job opportunity. Most jobs that international students have cannot find perfect match of local residents to fill. To get approval of STEM OPT, international students need to provide proof of employer supporting that they have qualified skills and education. Most of my international student friends work at High Tech companies, and they are supporting for the US economy. They are paying federal and state tax. Without OPT STEM OPT, those high tech companies will lose a lot of experts, which will affect the US economy. Furthermore, 24 month is very necessary for STEM OPT. High Tech projects usually last 3-4 years to finish. Many national funding (like NIH, NSF, DOE) are supporting for 3-4 years to finish. If only 1 year opt is provided, the student just become an expert and cannot continue, which is a waste of time and money.
