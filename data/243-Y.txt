Goutham Goud Kata I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. The Green Card is required for students to explore the enormous opportunities and fully utilize their knowledge and skills developed from the world class education. This would also help United States retain the talent which she has nurtured.
