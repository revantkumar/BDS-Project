These STEM student will work in the industries that are in short of human resoure. Of course more supply of labor will lower the pay, but from a whole view, if these industries get enough human resource, it will boost the economy, all the citizens can get benifits. Without these STEM students, the whole society productivity will be harmed, and finally the living standards may decline for more people.
