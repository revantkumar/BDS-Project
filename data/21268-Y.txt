I strongly SUPPORT this new proposal for my own reasons:
I am a recent international graduate of the University of Southern California with a Masters of Science Degree in Environmental Engineering. As I know, most of engineering students in USC are international students. After we graduate from university, we will face a very serious problem, which is to find a job in the United States. The main reason I choose to study here is the United States will provide the OPT opportunity to us during school or after graduation. Compared to those international students studying in British or other countries, we have more chances to practice what we learn in school in the United States. This is the most attractive point for those students who want to study aboard all over the world.
I know how hard it is for an international students majoring in Environmental Engineering. During the time when I was hunting for a job, the most frequent question that the recruiter asked me was Are you a citizen? or Do you need us to sponsor you? Every time I heard about this question, I knew that I would not get this job just because I do not have a visa. The reality is very cruel, but I have to accept it. So this OPT extension rule is a great hope for international STEM students undoubtedly. 
Hope this OPT extension rule will be approved and I will work hard in my field to do my contribution for this society.
