Vishwanath Tanneeru, University of Arizona I unequivocally support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness with rest of the world. Student's come to the US to fulfil their American dream and add value to the long heritage of this country, and allowing them to stay longer will continue to encourage world class talent to choose US as a preferred destination for higher education.
