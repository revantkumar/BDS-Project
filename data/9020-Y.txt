USA is famous for "melting pot" and welcome people from the world. Immigration system should be more fair and plans like OPT extending should be encouraged and supported by the government. Talents from the world should not be restrained by such rules. Besides, most Americans won't study in those STEM degrees. It won't cause competition between local Americans. OPT should be extended definitely!
