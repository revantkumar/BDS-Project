Ang Wu I like the new change of extending the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I'm sure it will give more opportunities to the students who have ever been struggling in America. Nobody wants to be kicked off here after a long time of hard work. Hope the government can take this consideration seriously, everyone has their right to choose where their place to work.
