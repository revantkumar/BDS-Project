I strongly support the OPT program and extending it to 24 months or even more.

First, OPT program brings those well educated young minds with good education, strong innovative mind and hot working enthusiasm into American industry. This makes American industry more competent and energetic.

Second, OPT program provides a great talent pool for American Companies eager for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathmatics minds, which is hardly get well supplied solely by native American students.

In the mean time, I saw a lot of comments objects OPT program for it reduces native American job's salary and the job oppotunities. That is not true. Let me put my point here. A talented and hard working mind always get a job now matter where he/she is. By simply excluding these non-native young minds from giving their training oppotunity in America does not help at all. If they go to Asia, the job oppotunities will go to Asia, if they go to Europe, jobs will go to Europe, if they go to Africa, companies will chase them to Africa and provide a job for them. With such a globalized world, people think they can get better job and better salaries by excluding other competitors will not win at all. And stoping the OPT program will not give what they want: jobs and oppotunities but leave this country's industry with less talents.
