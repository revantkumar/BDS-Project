I would strongly support this proposal. Whats really related with the unemployment rate is the economy situation. Its true that STEM students take some of our jobs, but we'd need to always think about the future. Talented STEM students would definitely make our economy better, and it's already been proven historically. Think of the growth of tech companies these years that STEM students more or less contributed to, the new job position they've opened is far more than the head count of STEM students. On the other hand, revoking the STEM extension would be a huge strike to those tech companies, are we affordable to take the risk?

In the past hundreds of years, the United States has defeated enemies, protected what's been valuable to us, and made the world a better place. The reason of these achievements is not because we built fences along our borders, but because we believed in the American Dream. I hope we still do today.
