I am writing to support this proposal as I believe this is the key to insure America's advantages in STEM field over the rest of the world. Most of the authors of the negative post believe that STEM students take the job opportunities away. But the truth is exactly the opposite. It is the highly skilled and innovative STEM students who keep the U.S. companies staying at the creative forefront and keep the U.S. economy strong. Only profitable companies can hire more employees, only strong economy can insure everybody's paycheck. The only result of sending back the STEM students is that now the companies of their home countries can utilize their skill learnt from U.S. to compete with U.S. companies. Because of the much lower labor cost these foreign companies now can design and manufacture products with the same or even better quality, at a much lower price. I believe this will be a disaster for U.S.. Other authors argue that American citizens pay tax and tuition for the education so that they deserve better opportunities. Please keep in mind that American citizen also benefits a lot from the public welfare systems, they already have much better opportunities. On the other hand, the foreign STEM students are paying much higher tax, more expensive tuition, contribute more to this country and yet have almost no right of any public welfare. Please keep in mind that it was the immigrants who built the this country and it is the immigrants who keep this country strong.
