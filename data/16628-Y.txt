It was a good proposal for the stem extension for f1 candidates . Students are wiling to study in USA not just for job but looking to improve they skill set not only studying but implementing there skill set in the field of research & contributing much to us economy . They should also given chance to work equally with Americans as they pay fee for education. they should given with some good time to became financially free before leaving the country. Hope this proposal will go for implementation successfully and help students
