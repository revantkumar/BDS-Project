USCIS allows F-1 students engaging in post-completion OPT are eligible for a 17-month STEM extension even if they have not yet completed the thesis requirement or equivalent for their STEM degree since October,2013. 

However SEVIS system still requires students to complete a degree in order to apply for OPT extension. Please update the change in SEVP system and inform all the school officials about the change.
