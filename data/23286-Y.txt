Are international STEM students stealing the jobs from US students? No, for god's sake. Most of the jobs international STEM students take are jobs that US students aren't willing to do. For example, in the academic area, a large part of the STEM post-doc candidates are international students, simply because US students don't want to be. Without a reasonable OPT period, PIs will have to pay more to get H1b for their post-docs, from their already shorted research funding.

Recent years, we have been improving our policy on illegal immigrants, then why should we say no to the STEM students with skills that our Universities need, our Companies need and our nation needs? Why should we say no to those hard working students who bring new tech, bring economic growth to our nation?
