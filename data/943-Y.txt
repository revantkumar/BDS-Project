This new rule is definitely a good choice for American people. Only fools wanna kick F-1students away. 
People are always worrying about no job opportunity on market, however how many American new graduates in STEM? When I was in college, all talents are not Americans. We don't have enough new blood for so many whales that contributes a lot to this land. We need talents staying! 
Please accept this new rule.
