Michael Markinson I have a lot of international friends who come from various parts of the world. I strongly support this rule because I can see the benefits to both the American students and international students.
They bring us the diversity in class, and also teach me a lot about their country and their culture. Without them, I can not learn so much in my college. So I would like to welcome more international students to come here for study and for practical training. Also, for my international friends, the OPT and OPT extensions programs are precious opportunities for them to practice what they have learnt in class.
It's beneficial to both of us, why not extend it!
