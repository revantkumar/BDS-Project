*OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and

*OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

One of my kids is a STEM worker. He has worked very hard to get where he is today to learn his job, be an exceptional employee, earn promotions and, most importantly, take care of his family. 

Why should a foreigner be able to swoop in and take a job from a Hard Working American without a need for them to have that job other than a whim by our government?

Why does our government want to destroy our middle class and put families into possible financial ruin because they no longer think Americans are worthy of a STEM job?

There is something seriously wrong with a system that so easily replaces Hard Working Americans with less skilled foreigners. 

Why is so easy for our government to take money from Social Security and Medicare without thinking of our senior citizens possibly not having access to the money they worked so hard to earn?

Shame on our politicians and our government for treating Americans like trash to be discarded in favor of foreign workers!
