To those who are against this proposal: I have no idea why you are holding a negative attitude to this meaningful regulation. And I would like to clarify a few points: 
Those who are eligible for STEM extension are those people who spent years at US universities, worked hard enough, and are smart and decent enough to stay here for another few years, in order to seek such opportunity to make more contribution to this country. As a matter of fact, international students have always been contributing to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy. 
I know some of you may think their stay may affect your chance of getting a job. The truth is that they'll only be offered those positions that any US citizens won't fit.
