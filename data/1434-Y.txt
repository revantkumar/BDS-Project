Anirudh Ruia Gali I support the extension. The proposed extension on OPT period is very useful and encouraging for international students for gaining post graduation degree here. As a Master's student, this ensures me that I get sufficient time to clear off all the high debts incurred for studying the Master's or any other related degree. 

This also achieves the fundamental purpose of obtaining an advanced degree by getting training and working in U.S in the field of study.
