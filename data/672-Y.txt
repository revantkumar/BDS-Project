As a Ph.D. student in science, I strongly SUPPORT to improve and expand training opportunities for foreign STEM students. The United States will benefit a lot by performing this proposal.
First of all, the United States invested a lot of education resources and money to train the involved students. Extension of OPT will allow more of them to stay in the United States to create social values.
Second, science and technology are the boost of the American economy. STEM students are an important role in pushing science and technology forward. and thus creating more working positions for Americans.
Third, the United States is a immigrants friendly country. This proposal will attract the STEM students to become new immigrants and serve the United States, and it will also attract potential excellent students to study in the United States.
