I support this ruling. I have been working with a lot of international students and working in quite a few multinational companies. I do not think that there are enough US citizens for all the stem positions we have. This is a fact and we cannot deny it. I think that we have enough protection because a lot of international students talk about the "US Citizens Only" requirement in most of the jobs they want to apply for. I also never see a lower wage for international students than for local students. In fact the companies have to pay for a lot of fees for the students to work in the US. I think this is not a crisis, but a good opportunity for the country to attract the best people in the world. There may not be a trend of coming to the US to study forever, and we may lose the fight for talents in the long run of the history.
