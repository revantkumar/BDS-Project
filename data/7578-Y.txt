Vidhya Srinivasan Kannan I strongly support the STEM OPT extension. It gives a great opportunity for international students pursuing Masters in STEM field, to make apply their knowledge practially. At the same time, it is a wonderful opportunity for the companies to retain bright talent and get innovative ideas from fresh college graduates. So, having talented people work at organizations from various domains would help the US economy to prosper as well. Being a student myself, I am looking forward for the STEM ruling to come into effect and benefit all people.
