I strongly support this proposal about expanding OPT for F-1 STEM students.
As we all know, these students represent a large portion of employees in various STEM-related companies.Without these students, companies will have to face severe hardship, so will the country's economy. By expanding the OPT opportunities, the government can show a more welcome gesture to these future employee and encourage them to pursue scientific research in the US.
