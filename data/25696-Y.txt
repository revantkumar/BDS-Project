I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: First of all, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S., I have been working as a HR for years, and I have seen lots of international students who are really hard working and effective at their work. I believe the purpose that we run the yearly EEO report is diversity id very important for the U.S., and it's the diversity that makes America such a good country. Statistics indicate that more than 10% of the scientists who made a huge contribution to the science in U.S. are used to international students, the only reason why they can still make contributions to our country is because we can let them stay.
The other important reason is, there is no doubt that competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing. The majority of international students are in STEM majors, they are not posing any threats to our local people who are looking for entry level jobs as they are focusing on different fields and levels. On the other side, competition makes our residents continue improving themselves so that they can do a better job, which is exactly the form of positive competition, and they are very helpful in developing a better working environment for us.
