I strongly agree the OPT extension rule. Compared to American students, international student have way fewer opportunities, and it is a misunderstanding that this is for companies to hire cheap foreign labor as the average salary of IT companies is higher than the average salary of US. Actually, OPT extension means more resources for tech-filed companies. Next generation technologies will bring down the living cost for everyone and create more jobs for American students as well.
