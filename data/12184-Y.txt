I saw some comments saying like native born Americans are losing too many jobs to foreign workers. Can you bring evidence? Americans will not lose job if there are no foreigners? I do not think so. Many companies have open positions which cannot be filled. Why? because in some industries, the demands in qualified talents are huge; there are not enough workers. then why do not hire qualified international students? Why do not hire talents to contribute to America? and give them an opportunity to have practical experience. also help the cultural and economic exchange. The open and diversified cultural helped America in the past and it will contribute to the development of America in the future.
