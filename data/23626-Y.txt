I strongly agree the new rule. As a stem-program student, I do need the time to find an ideal job for myself. And also the new rule would allow me to work legally in the US for another two years. Then I can gain two to three years work experience and then come back to my country, while one year OPT period is a little short. For some international students who can get H1B visa by their companies, they have opportunities to apply for H1B visa several times since it's very hard to have the H1B visa once now. 

The new rule of 24-month OPT extension period is very important for the international students. Hope you can approve it!!
