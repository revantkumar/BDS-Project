I strongly agree with the 24 month expanding for OPT for F1 students, especially those with Ph.D degree. 

They can contribute much that other without Ph.D degree can not. If they do not have much opportunity to work in our country, they will use their knowledge to contribute other countries which may be our enemy countries. 

Our country was built on elites. Our country was improved by competition. We need new blood. Those Ph.D students are trained by our nation and they should be kept and contribute to us instead of being kicked away with those knowledge and experience.
