Its very important to expand opportunities to students who are studying in USA. its not easy to get full length experience just by studying masters degree in STEM . We also want professional experience for some years which when we go back to our homeland helps us to stand ahead of others. While the current 12 months is not even enough to settle in the corporate environment , it will be better if we get at least 24 months of work culture to gain professional experience. I support the above rule to implement which benefits lakhs of Students who came here with lots of hopes on gaining knowledge.
