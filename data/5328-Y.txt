Ziran Chen I support the extension of STEM OPT to 24 months.

Because the extension can really make a big difference when a non-US resident who has degree in STEM, try to find a job. Without the extension, we only have one year permission to work in US right after graduation, which means there is only one chance to apply the H1b visa. Then,since one can only apply for it onece a year and it is not for sure to get it each time, the employer will have to consider the situation that the future foreign employee has a high possibility to leave the country after one year if they fail to get the H1b visa no matter how good they are at their work. If this happens, it will cause trouble and loss for the company. So, in the future they will reduce the opening positions for non-resident people like us. In other words, without the extension, it will be really difficult to find a job.
