Removing OPT extension will be a step backward towards making US the most competitive country globally. The United States have been at the top of its game because it attracts talents from all over the world, and absorbs variety of culture into its own. It is important to note that the OPT is not an immigration visa. It is the shortest working permit for international students. An H1B working visa is longer (3 years). Therefore the OPT is a selection mechanism to allow employers to select the most talented foreigners. Those foreigners who are appreciated and highly valued will be offered longer working visa or even immigration to the US. Extension of OPT allows international students to be able to have internships, switch employers, and finally, either find their best match, or go back to their own country. If OPT is only 12 month, how can employers decide who are the best candidates?
