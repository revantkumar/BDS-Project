I strongly support the OPT extension.
It's wrong to cut off the OPT extension in such a low unemployment rate, which is historical low 5.1%. It indicates the American industry needs more employees to boost the economy. Cutting off and expelling new employees with cutting edge expertise would lead the American industry grow slowly. 
The unemployment rate was 7.1% in 2008. When the government extend the OPT, it reduces dramatically to 5.1% in 2015. How can we say the foreign STEM students take away our job positions? They really create job positions.
