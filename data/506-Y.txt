This will be great rule if successful, it will definitely alleviate the pains of maximum International students with advanced degrees.
Two primary benefits:
1. Gaining more work experience in the three years that they are allowed to work in US with out H1B, the companies can also
get more time to assess the employee before sponsoring them, it is a win-win for multinational and even smaller companies.
2. Allowing students a chance at three H1B attempts, which we all know is getting harder to come by these days.

I would also like to suggest following this good news with even a H1B reform which will make our lives much better.
