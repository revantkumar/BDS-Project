I'm a CS phd student. I'll spend 5 and more years to graduate in the PhD program so I hope my hard work can pay off. With an extended OPT, there is more freedom I can choose my career. If an OPT is 1 year only, you either be lucky to get an H1B or just go home. But with extended OPT, then I will have 3 years in total to evaluate my career and have the freedom to work for the country
