I strongly support the OPT 24 months extension policy.
I am a recent graduated PhD student. My OPT started on August 31st this year.
And I found a job in a start-up company, and I started to work for this company from September this year. 
What I am doing so far is highly valued by the employer. Also the employer is very willing to support me as a local worker. If my OPT expires next year August and I have to go back home, the company's productivity are largely reduced because the knowledge in this field is limited within very few people. The company may suffer a lot due to losing me.
As always, I don't feel like to be harassed by the legal staying status issues all the time. What I want to do is to stay calm and carry on doing my whole works.
I sincerely wish this extension protocol can be passed in a short time.

Thanks,
Jinya
