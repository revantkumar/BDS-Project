I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of 
payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies
to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received 
their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is 
not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 (Center for Immigration Studies)
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds (Center for Immigration Studies).
This gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students OVER Americans
The OPT is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the 
H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.
It undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.
By expanding this OPT program, the Obama Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B
program, in violation of Congressional intent.
"Not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students 
desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes." 
(Sam Rolley)
It will cost Social Security an estimated $1 billion dollars a year.

Why would you preempt Americans? Why would you make it irresistible for employers to hire foreigners OVER that of 
Americans? What is the ultimate goal for DHS and the Administration?
