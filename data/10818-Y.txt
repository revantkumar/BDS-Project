I believe this is a win-win for both US government and F1 student. And will do no harm to US citizens. Because F1 student with STEMP extension usually works for restricted positions only related to fields with very few US students.
US students do not like science or math majors and don't want to spend time in school to get a Master's or PHD degree and will not be able for those positions.
But for development of US, US government need a lot of experts in those fields, thus it is a success for both international students and US government.
