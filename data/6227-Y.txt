Colin Fisher If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow them to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM.
