This is a great idea. Many of these students come to the US for the education and find jobs in their subject area but can not stay because of the time limits. US Companies invest time and money training these students and then lose them to non-US companies after they have been trained. The US potentially lose very bright and ambitious workers that can add great value to companies and the US as a whole. They come to this country for an American education and the US should get the benefit of their knowledge not a foreign country.
