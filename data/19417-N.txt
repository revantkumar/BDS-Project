Please remember who you work for, it us the American People. In expanding training,
if a person wants to become an American, from a foreign entity that is one thing.
But to give Employer's only benefits if they hire a foreign student for training is absurd. Please keep your priorities for the American worker.
And certainly explain as to why foreign training is better?
