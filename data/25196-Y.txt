I trained foreign students at the University of California San Francisco. The school loved foreign students because they pay out of state tuition. It was a business. It took one year to train most up to a level equal to a US graduate. Most foreign students view a student visa as the key to permanent resident status bypassing the normal visa route. US employers can hire these people for less than a US citizen which discriminates against a US citizen with help from the US government. It is an advantage to be a foreigner rather than a citizen in this country. This is absurd. It is as absurd as an illegal alien paying instate tuition at a taxpayer supported university while a US citizen from a different state pays out of state higher tuition. It is an advantage to be an illegal alien than to be a US citizen! It is an advantage to be a foreign F-1 and apply for OPT exemption while a US citizen with the same qualifications is excluded. The federal government is actively discriminating against its own citizens. This is done by executive fiat bypassing the representatives of the American people in Congress. This is absurd and should be illegal!
