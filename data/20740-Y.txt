I totally agree with this Improving and Expanding policy.

Because:

1) Actually, considerable amount of scientists and engineers are come from abroad. They contribute a lot to this country's development.

2) USA is a immigrants' country. The spirits of America is inclusion and freedom, in hundreds of years. It is immigrants and the inclusion spirits helped USA to become so powerful today.

So, I believe this policy will help USA go better.
