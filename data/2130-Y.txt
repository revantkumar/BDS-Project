Zheng Lu I strongly SUPPORT OPT extension rule.
Firstly, I'm an international student who plan to graduate next year. Before I came to America, I knew STEM major students have opportunity to extend OPT. And this is also the greatest reason I came here to study by paying high tuition. I think US government should keep the promise to give us STEM students opt extension.

Secondly, in the past decades, OPT students have made great contribution to the development of America economy and technology. There are too many foreigner professional talents working on too many labs. In addition, most of projects they focus on have to take a long time to implement, one year OPT is definitely not enough. If OPT extension is canceled, these ongoing projects would be discarded that would affect development of US technology.

Plus, American is the biggest immigration country in the world. The reason why American has the top position of the world is US government knows how to fully take advantage of different talents from different countries. If OPT extension is canceled, most of foreigner talents will be pushed back to their country which means US not only loses many talents but has more competitors in technology field. In the 21st century, talents are the most powerful resources in the world.

In conclusion, I support OPT extension policy.
