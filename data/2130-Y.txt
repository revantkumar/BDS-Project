I strongly support the DHS's new rules for STEM extension. Imagine if all STEM brilliant students from different countries and cultures are ruled out from United States because of losing OPT extension, what could the most high tech companies from silicon valley to wall street become? Foreign STEM students' hard work has already been proved to be creative and powerful and US has benefited much more from them rather than losing job opportunities for your own citizens.
