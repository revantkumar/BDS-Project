I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The U.S. government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. industries 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many great achievements of the U.S. are made by the foreign students. So extend the OPT Period is a win-win for both U.S. government and foreign students'sake.
