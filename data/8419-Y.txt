Opt extension not only gives international students the chance to apply their skills in a professional environment, but also allows them to contribute back to the society after a US superior education. A lot of these students who I consider as the elites of other countries, will use their knowledge to provide the community with a greater benefit and create more job opportunities than ever. The new policy is a win-win situation for both US society and international students, I'm all for it!
