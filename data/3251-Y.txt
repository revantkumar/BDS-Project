Everything has both sides. What I really believe is that, in the long term, it's good for American society. As far as I am concerned, F1 students are totally different from illegal immigrants, they are well-educated, and will make contributions to U.S. economy.

One requirement for H1B visa is that, the salary for international students should be higher than average level, which means, they are not cheap labor at all. Those employers are smart, they will never hire a student because they come from other countries, they will hire student cuz they see the tough soul, under their skin, no matter what color it is.

Competition is good, and U.S. is a nation of immigrant. We can close the door for illegal students, but should not close the door for smart people, for outstanding students over around the world.
