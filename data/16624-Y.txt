Now we have many internationa students in USA, they bring a lot of opportunities for Americans for their jobs and house renting. Not only the students themselves, but also their relatives, their parents, etc come to USA, they will stay and spend in US.

If we revoke OPT extention, then the quantity of international students will be much much smaller. It is obvious bad news for us, a lot of empty house can not be rent out, no so many visitors,etc,etc.
