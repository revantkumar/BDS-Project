I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international graduate student from China and will be working in the U.S. soon. It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students.
I'm an international Statistics master student from China and was a Data Analyst intern at XXX. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents.
Also, STEM OPT extension helps to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. I came to U.S. because I believe it will better prepare me for a professional career in the OPT and the extension period. Though tuition in U.S., especially in private school, is huge amount of money, I still feel it worthwhile if I am able to develop professional skills, and also to have enough time to gain practical experience in the industry because I will have excellent resume to bring back to China.
Lastly, I am eager to go back to China after the OPT. Because China is developing very fast and I want to live and work there for the rest of my life. But only one year's working experience is of little help for me to get a very good job in China. So with this new OPT extension, I could gain more working experience and get a better job in China, which could help me a lot.
