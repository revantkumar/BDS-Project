Shen Yan I am currently a physics Ph.D. student at Duke University, and I am from China. I understand that many US citizens are concerned about their job opportunities being at risk if us foreigners are given too many "privileges". I must say that it will not be the case. 

From the perspective of a employer, if a U.S. citizen and a foreigner are both qualified for a position, the employer would certainly hire the local citizen, considering how much trouble they have to go through if they hired a foreigner. Then, what is the reason for countless foreigners being hired at top tech companies? Apparently, we possess some qualities that the hiring manager deem essential for the job. If U.S. citizens are willing to take effort studying subjects related to the STEM, I am sure there would not be much room left for the international students: all the companies would hire local people, and we would go back by ourselves. However, most of the American people, at least I think, are not interested in putting effort in studying such areas, while the high-end technology companies need people to do those jobs. 

Being the most powerful countries in the world, the U.S. need not only to meet the needs of their citizens, but also to be at the top of the world in almost every field. To achieve that, the U.S. needs foreigners, hardworking and intelligent foreigners. At the meantime, our work may create more job opportunities than we are taking. 

I would be really happy if more U.S. citizens start learning STEM. If we compete for the same job and you are indeed better than me, I am more than happy to go back to China, but please do not deprive us of the opportunities to make contributions to this country, as well as this world.
