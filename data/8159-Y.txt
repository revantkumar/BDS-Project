I think this rule should be brought into effect because a begining professional only starts to learn and pick up skills during his first year on the job. A beginner must have at least two years to deliver or produce something useful which aids in his career and skill growth. Also, I believe it is extremely hard for someone to find a employer who is willing to hire and train only for a one year duration only to see his investment leave the country in an year or so.
