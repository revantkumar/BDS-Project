Devang Sinha I strongly support this rule. I believe that by extending the OPT period to 24 months, international students can gain valuable and unmatched exposure and experience by working with some of the best firms and companies in the US and at the same time, the US economy will get a huge boost by attracting the best and the brightest of minds from all over the globe. So, its a win-win situation for both parties. International students bring a lot of potential and skills with them when they come to study in the US. By extending the OPT period, the US economy can use this huge reservoir of potential to their benefit.
