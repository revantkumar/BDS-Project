Companies like Southern California Edison and Disney are laying of hundreds of American workers, including Tech workers and replacing them with foreigners using the H-1B visa program .
Some companies are forcing the American workers to train these foreigners if they want their severance package .
As far as the Stem program, thousands of American students with degrees in these fields can`t find jobs because companies would rather hire foreigners because of lower wages and less benefits .
It is time to stop this injustice perpetuated upon the American people by this Administration .
