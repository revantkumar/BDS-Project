Nowadays, F-1 students with STEM degree contributes a lot to U.S. economy, in silicon valley, financial industry and also other fields. STEM degree students are elites from all around the world, they are the precious human resources for other countries. I know that some countries build up all kinds of benefits system to attract these students to come back to their own country. However, since US is a countries has more freedom and mature market, many student would like to work for these country for many years for better career development. 

Expanding training opportunities has nothing related to immigration. Tons of student just want spend several years at US for working experience, and then they will just come back home, since their root is in their home country. I have many international students friends, 8 out of 10 students said that they want to go back after 3 years of working in US, because they working here just want to have more chance to be a success in their own country in the future. 

Because they are precious high intelligent human resource, expanding training opportunity for F-1 non-immigrant student with STEM degree will greatly help U.S to be prosperous in economy and all other related aspects. 

I strong recommend that for US's future benefit in the long run. Improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students.
