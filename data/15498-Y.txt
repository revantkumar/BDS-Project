I strongly support the extension of OPT for the following reasons.
1. The immigrants did not steal jobs from Americans. They got their jobs because they served this nation very well at their positions. The employers are not fools. They choose to employ the people who are able to make the best contributions to their companies, organizations, and this country. Although some Americans failed in the job competitions, it was no the fault of the immigrants. These immigrants served most of the Americans and this country better than their competitors, and that was why they deserved their jobs.
2. This country needs immigrants. Just like President Kennedy said: "ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country", the immigrants have made great contributions to this country. How many scientists and engineers are born outside the USA? How many university teachers are born outside the USA? What would this country be like if these immigrants did not have the chance to make contribution to the country? We must face these questions before we cancel the extension of OPT.
3. The Americans must face the competition from the immigrants. Competition forces people to do their best.
4. If these immigrants return to work at their home countries, their talents may be used by the enemies of the USA. Think about the scientists and engineers who were born in China, Russia, and Middle East. If they work at their home countries, they will fall to the hand to the dictators, and will not even have the chance to say no to the dictators. The enemies of the USA will of course post stronger threats to this country.
