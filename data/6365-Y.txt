Hongyan Shuai I support OPT extension for the following reasons. 
1) OPT extension is good for American university to have more international students. Foreigner students always hope they can have a work practice after done their study before back to their countries, because a good work experience help them find a job easier when they back to their country. OPT extension gives foreigner students a good opportunity to have a work practice and improving language skills, so they would like to study in America with expensive tuition. It's hard for American universities to have more international students if the government cancelled the OPT extension.
2) A lot of companies will be effected by cancelling OPT extension. The companies will lose many foreigner employees. For example, I live in Detroit,MI, we all know that Detroit is an auto city. There are many auto company and auto suppliers companies. A plenty of foreigner employees are hired by those companies. They will lose many employees and probably have a tough time to run the production. 
3)OPT extension can bring benefits for both American people and foreigner people. People can learn different culture from people from different countries, which will make American culture more colorful.
