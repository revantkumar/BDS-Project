I strongly support this rule. 

I go through the negative feedbacks.

1. Some of them are copy and paste. They start with the same pattern and some of them even get some errors with grammar. I doubt that those were submitted on purpose to stop this rule.

2. Each of them is talking about 'American first'. This is definitely common sense that employer will put Americans as the first place. But u guys can't fill the hole without STEM students, especially for high tech ones. 

3. Somebody just says their children can't find a job. Their major is Russian language. I have to say, it this related with STEM? Do u ever know what STEM is? Ridiculous American mama.
