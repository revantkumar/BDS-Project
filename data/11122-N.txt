I oppose the expansion of the OPT program. It is not in the best interest of Americans to support this plan. I think companies
already earn enough off the backs of it's overworked staff without rewarding them for not hiring Americans and for hiring 
foreigners by not making the requirements the same. With this plan, the companies don't have to pay their fair share of 
payroll taxes for people that will use the social network we American's have created for Americans. Also, It will further depress 
the wages of American citizens, who haven't seen a wage increase in years. If you decimate our tech industry, who will ward off 
the cyber attacks from other countries? Certainly not the people that come from other countries. Quit fighting for large 
corporations and fight for the little guy for a change, American workers. Be a Hero for us!
