Robert Peeples I am an American citizen born in the USA who works and lives in the Silicon Valley area as an engineer. I am opposed to the new rule based on my experience in Silicon Valley, having seen US citizen engineers with STEM degrees and relevant work experience either have trouble finding work or dropping out of the field altogether. Based on my experience working at Silicon Valley tech companies, seeing their lobbying for more cheap foreign labor that will drive down wages and reduce available jobs for American citizens, as well as proposed government rules such as this, I would not advise any American citizen starting college to pursue a STEM degree nor would I do so myself if I were starting college. Why go through years of hard work and take on debt only to be subjected to this kind of abuse by supposedly "American" companies and a US government that doesn't care one bit about American workers? What would be the point?

Also, the number of foreign STEM students in our country needs to be reduced, especially from China a country that is building a war machine designed to fight the US military. Some excerpts from a 2012 Bloomberg article titled "American Universities Infected by Foreign Spies Detected by FBI"

-"We have intelligence and cases indicating that U.S. universities are indeed a target of foreign intelligence services," Frank Figliuzzi, Federal Bureau of Investigation assistant director for counterintelligence, said in a February interview in the bureau's Washington headquarters.

-"....universities are an "ideal place" for foreign intelligence services "to find recruits, propose and nurture ideas, learn and even steal research data, or place trainees," according to a 2011 FBI report."

-"Unlike its counterparts in other countries, which rely on their own operatives, China's intelligence service deploys a freelance network including students, researchers and false-front companies, said David Major, president of the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies in Falls Church, Virginia and a former FBI official.

China has "lots of students who either are forced to or volunteer to collect information," he said. "I've heard it said, 'If it wanted to steal a beach, Russia would send a forklift. China would send a thousand people who would pick up a grain of sand at a time.'"

China also has more than 3,000 front companies in the U.S. "for the sole purpose of acquiring our technology," former CIA officer S. Eugene Poteat, president of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers in McLean, Virginia."

-"Over the years, American universities have enabled China "to leapfrog into the cutting edge of military capability on the way to superpower status," Richard Fisher, senior fellow on Asian Military Affairs at the International Assessment and Strategy Center in Alexandria, Virginia, said in an e-mail.

-"A university may not know that a visiting engineer could be conducting sponsored research on a military program that could hurt Americans in the event of a conflict," Stokes said. "An engineer supporting a People's Liberation Army program is unlikely to advertise his or her purpose."

-"Stanford does not, nor will it, restrict participation of students on the basis of citizenship," President John Hennessy testified at a January 2010, congressional hearing in Palo Alto, California. More than half of Stanford's doctoral candidates in the physical sciences and engineering come from outside the U.S., he said.

Asked by Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican congressman from California, if he had read that Chinese military intelligence uses Chinese students, Hennessy said, "I am aware of that."

"Universities need to think that they are patriotic Americans, too," Rohrabacher responded.
