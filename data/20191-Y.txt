It's really a good decision! I think this is beneficial for both international students seeking for jobs and companies/institutions in need of appropriate professionals. Students would have more time to find a proper position. And companies don't need to worry that many of their OPT employers would lose legal working status, which affects company operations. It is also cool for native talents. They can learn a lot and have some fun if working with people from diverse cultural backgrounds.
