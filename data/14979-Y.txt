I strongly support this proposal. STEM is the core for science and technology development of the society. STEM education plays an irreplaceable role in future economic prosperity, which is is closely linked with student success in the STEM fields.However, the job postings in STEM fields outnumber unemployed people in the STEM field, which indicates a deficiency in STEM students. Furthermore, statistics show that almost 20% of PhD STEM students leave STEM careers after they graduate. 

The proposed rule here could efficiently encourage more students into STEM, and help STEM students strengthening and extending on-the-job training. The training could build up students' faith in STEM careers and keep them in STEM. Students who are engaged in practical training for longer time could gain better understanding in the industry and make greater contributions to the economy.
