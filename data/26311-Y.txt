As an international student, I strongly support this Proposed Rule. I have 3 arguments for this rule. 
1. Increasing extension for STEM major won't decrease the positions for local workers. STEM major related positions are constantly desirable for industry and far from fully fulfilled yet.
2. STEM major students are often talents that can make times' contributions than their salaries, increasing working opportunities for them will be a nice trade in total for all U.S citizens, either immigration supporters or non-immigration supporters. 
3. The number of immigrants from STEM is not decided by how long OPT-extension is, but how many H1B ration will be there. OPT extension will make them think more, contribute more.
