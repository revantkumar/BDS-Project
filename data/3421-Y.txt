I strongly support the expanding training for F1 with STEM Degrees. As an international student, I regard the long training opportunities after receiving degrees as a reason why I choose the United States to study STEM major for the first place. After all, the knowledge and courses learned during education in different universities around the world are very similar, not to mention people can now learn nearly everything from MOOC these days. What's more, the reason why we would like to pay such high fee to study here is not just to go back our home country to find an entry level job, but to find the job that worth our investment on our Education when we back home. Considering hands-on training in the job market outside the campus is a big plus on our working capability and make us easier for us to find suitable jobs at home, I strongly support the expanding OPT for F1 STEM students.
