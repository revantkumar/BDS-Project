As an international student involved in STEM major. I really support this proposal!

There are many invisible "discrimination" in the job seeking field for us. It is because we are international student and we need the sponsorship for H1B after the 1year(with 17 possible extension) opt. Many employers do not want to sponsor so they dont want to hire us even we do an excellent job in our field. It's totally unfair.

If we have access to a longer OPT period, we may have more time to find a job position, and may also have more time to show our ability and convince the employer to sponsor us.
