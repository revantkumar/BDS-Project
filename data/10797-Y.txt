Ming Gao I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned STEM knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. STEM is very important to the development of U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It's good for U.S. development.
