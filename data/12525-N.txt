Foreign students agreed to leave IMMEDIATELY after completing their course work. They must honor that promise!!
They should NOT be allowed to take jobs from US citizens because they can be paid a lower wage. 
US citizens deserve US jobs 1st, particularly because SO MANY US tech and STEM graduates are NOT employed in their fields.
Tech companies must NOT be allowed to rob Social Security and Medicare programs of their employer contribution, particularly when Social Security and Medicare are already underfunded
US jobs for US citizens FIRST!!!
