Optional Practical Training (OPT) is an absolutely good plan. U.S technical companies are still in a high-speed development period, they need lots of technical workers to help them keep rising. However, U.S citizen employee which work for technical companies, were less than companies need. But OPT give lots opportunities for international students working legally, U.S companies get lots of good employees, and lots of international students get Training and Working experiences. That's is a win-win plan, good plan.
