I strongly support the decision to expand the training opportunities and expanding the duration of STEM extension. F1 students make a great contribution to the economic growth of America especially in technology and engineering fields. Giving them this opportunity will not cut American jobs but will instead generate a huge brand new potential for job opportunities.
