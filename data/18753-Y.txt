F-1 nonimmigrant students in the United States have been given a great opportunity by the USCIS to work in the United States. The students who visit the United States to pursue studies, need experience along with theoretical knowledge. This helps the students to get experience in their field of study. As many of you already know, it is the experience that matters the most. 

I am an International student and i am pursuing my MBA, The USCIS decided that students pursuing MBA will only be eligible for a 12 month OPT as MBA is not a specialized study and most management related jobs do not require experience. But this is unlikely when it comes to Specialized studies, (STEM) courses. The students of STEM need a lot of experience and even when they work for several years, its never enough. Majority of these STEM students secure jobs in Technology sector and in USA there are so many jobs in technology which are not filled for months and there is a lack of people who work in these specialized fields. The students in STEM courses fill these jobs and it helps the companies and also the students. The students can gain experience by working in these jobs and they can use this experience when they go back to their home countries. 

I am pursuing an MBA degree and the USCIS says MBA's can get only 12 months of OPT, i agree to that rule even when i am only getting a 12 month OPT. The USCIS says STEM students can get STEM extension and i strongly support the decision.
