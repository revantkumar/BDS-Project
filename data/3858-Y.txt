MARILYN ASSENHEIM The insanity of putting additional foreign workers ahead of United States citizens to appease corporate interests 
and a completely unhinged, anti-American bureaucracy has to stop. Americans already believe that our policy of 
destroying the country and its citizenry is not accidental; you are proving that belief is true. 
STOP THIS OUTRAGEOUS, INSANE BEHAVIOR NOW.
