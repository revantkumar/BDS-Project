The opt extension is of great significance to American industry and American people. As far as I know, employers, especially employers from high-tech companies hire a large number of international graduates every year, whose work authorization depend on opt. These new graduates determine the future of American economy on some degree. Their consistent contribution depends on H1B or opt status. As we know, H1B is authorized by lottery. Many students might be unable to get H1B in only one loterry. It might be unfair to depart them due to their bad luck. That could be a discrepancy from the containment in the US spirits. This opt extension can provide more opportunities for them to build their careers and a better USA. On the other hand, if the opt extension policy is cancelled, fewer international students would choose to study in the USA. Thw financial revenues from international students in housing, dining, education and traveling will decrease dramatically. In that case, the unemployment rate among local American poeple would increase. In conclusion, the opt extensions are beneficial for both individual and American economy.
