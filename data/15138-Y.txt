I certainly agree with rule for the reasons below:
1. The United States is the representative country of providing equal opportunities. Talented students from all over the world come to the U.S. with their American dreams. They deserve this opportunity to put their skills and knowledge into practical use. 
2. The implement of this rule will definitely attract more students come to the U.S. and look for further education. On the one hand, it will boost the educational competitiveness of the country, on the other hand, the increment of the nonimmigrant students will bring economic benefits for America. 
3. According to the economy situation right now, talented F-1 students are very essential to the companies. Those enthusiastic hard working students will definitely bring innovation ideas and energy to the company they will be working for. 
4. If this rule isn't approved, lots of students who are currently during their OPT might lose their jobs. Moreover, their employers will burden invaluable losses. As for those students who will be graduating recently, it is a definitely unequal decision to them. Their opportunities will be taken before they even got it.
Based on the reasons above, I strongly support this proposed rule.
