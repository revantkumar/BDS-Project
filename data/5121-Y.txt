Ying Li I think the STEM OPT should be prolonged.
For the first reason,everybody who studied in the US should have the same opportunity to find a job.We should not show the racial discrimination to non-Americans.
For the second reason,some native Americans have a short view on this policy.They think this policy make them to lose jobs.But when you enter into a class of STEM major,you will find there are even only 2 or 3 American students in each class who study the STEM major.Even those 2 or 3 students,they are always rank the last 3 positions in the class.Most of the American student can not handle these majors.However,US need a lot of students to help them deal with the STEM problems.So,just be comprehensive and give every international student the same opportunity!Thus,USA will always be the strongest country in the WORLD!!!
