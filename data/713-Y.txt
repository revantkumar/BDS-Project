F-1 non immigrant students come here to better their academic value by pursuing higher degrees in their interested STEM field of study very rigorously. The advance research facilities and faculty of the many universities in the United States attract such students to add value to their academic career but all this will be in vain if they are not given a chance to get exposed to practical training in the American Industry to apply their knowledge and expand their horizon by adhering to the global work culture which is seen here in every industry and this training should be given ample time for them to progress and apply their knowledge successfully. Extending and improving training opportunities for non immigrant students must be made mandatory taking due regard to such students' voices to advance their career effectively in the future because theoretical skills are wasted otherwise if not given a chance to apply practically for everyday problems for finding cutting edge solutions and such training platforms are not present in the third world countries from which most of such students come from. So in my opinion the concerned authorities must consider improving and expanding training opportunities with STEM degrees for all eligible F-1 students.
