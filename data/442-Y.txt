Thank you for the revised the rule.

OPT - STEM Extension 24 months is good but making it to 36 months would be great opportunity to the foreign students as well as to the US economy as the students here on OPT would work gain more practical knowledge and would love to start their own companies through which lot of jobs could be created and would be useful to the US community and economy as well.

As OPT Extension has a significant role for both USA and international students. I strongly recommend if the OPT- STEM Extension is for 36 months.

Thanks!
