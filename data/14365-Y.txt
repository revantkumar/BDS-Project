To those who is shouting on this web to object the extension:

Stop complaining about the Extension squeezing locals out of the job market! Employers are NOT charity, they have no obligation to provide jobs to those who are not capable to the position but are only citizens! If you want a job, READ your textbooks and WORK as half diligently as the international students!
