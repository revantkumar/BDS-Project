I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Most high-tech companies need lots of STEM talents. The very important reason why they can hire so many STEM talents from the world is the American STEM OPT extension. If this extension is not available, I don't think American can still attract so many STEM talents. At least I will go to a country with better policy to foreign STEM students. Some people argue that foreign STEM students steal jobs from American, which is not true. Foreign STEM students are contributing to American. Without them, there will be very limited people who are capable of doing their jobs.
