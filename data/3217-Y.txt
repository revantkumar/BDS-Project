Che Zheng I support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. STEM extension have been applied many years, allowing foreign students to apply the skills they learned from university in real world jobs beyond the OPT period. This have benefitted not only the students, but also the industries, which is able to hire the best engineers and scientists without limitation in visa and greatly improve its competitiveness around the world. 

2. OPT and STEM extension also strengthened the competitiveness of US university and higher level education, as students can learn not only from texts and courses, but also through practicing in post graduation jobs, which definitely improve their career development and have been one of the most attracting point of US education. Thus the education industry in US, including colleges, universities and graduation education organization, can admit good students all over the world whose work will greatly contribute to the development of science and engineering research in US. Universities can also gain more revenue, hire best faculties and keep their leading position.

3. STEM extension have little effect to job opportunities of US citizens, as OPT are designed at the purpose to solve the problem that talents with US citizenship cannot fulfill all available technical positions inside US. Due to the flourish of technical industry in US, the gap between the number of STEM talents and STEM positions grows and STEM extension will still help.
