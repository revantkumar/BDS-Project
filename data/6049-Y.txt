As an owner of an apartment in Chicago, I strongly support this proposal for OPT extension. Each year many STEM students would come to this city and they need a place to stay. Right now almost 80% of my apartment is leased to international students, most of them are from India and China. They are friendly and hardworking people. Most importantly to me is that these international students are important source for me. They appreciate me for providing good services in the apartment and I thank them for choosing my apartment and stay in here. These international students also bring me a lot of potential guest like their friends and their classmates. They would refer friends to live in here after they have moved out. 
I think if OPT extension is cancelled, there would not be so many students coming and apartment owners like me, especially those who own apartments around universities, would lose a large number of guests every year and this would not be beneficial to us.
