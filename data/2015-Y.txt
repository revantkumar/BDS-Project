Hello
I donot have any positive or negative concerns regarding immigrants who work based on H1 or Opt but there is no point in blaming students or consultacies as USA cannot provide jobs for freshers. I practically saw people who worked their wings off to get a job as fresher. No company wants to hire a fresher. First thing in their job description says is minimum requirement of 7years experience and there are so many layers between client and candidate that the candidate hardly gets $30/hr as a developer. You just cannot stop getting immigrants because in my opinion its not important that where you come from or what is your educational background. What you have in you, what you can do matters.
