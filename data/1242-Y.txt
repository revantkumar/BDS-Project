Weiwei Zhao I strongly support this because of following reasons:

First, let us look at today's American economy, which is much ahead of other developed countries, including many European countries. Why? A main reason is that America has significant contribution made by international talented people, who were studying in American universities as international students, especially in Engineering, Science and Technology area.

Second, the traditional American spirit advocates everyone deserves to be treated equally. So F-1 students are supposed to have a chance to practice after their graduation, to make themselves useful and make real contribution.

In addition, nowadays, more and more internationals are making United States as their first choice for studying abroad. Not only because of the advanced education system but also because of OPT and OPT extension policy, since they would have more opportunities after graduation, not like international students studying in British, having no choice but to go back to their countries when they graduate.

Last, I think for STEM program, time is really important. Maybe for a project which is not so complicated, people do need hundreds of, or even thousands of experiments, which, of course, needs much more time. STEM students do not want immigration, they just want some more legal time and identities to allow them making contributions. 

Therefore, I definitely support this OPT extension rules for international STEM students.
