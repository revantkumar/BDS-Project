Can you explain why in our current economy where many Americans still are unable to find work which affords them the ability to make a decent living, you are making it easier for foreigners to come to the US and work?

Can you also give your assurance that these foreigners will continue to earn their subsistence and not become a burden to the US taxpayer by going on public assistance.

What steps and changes to the regulations will you put into effect to ensure that Americans are not negatively affected by these policies?
