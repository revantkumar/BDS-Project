Respected Federal government of USA;

This is Sam, and I am a gradaute student done masters in Electrical Engineering stream overhere in USA. Nowadays i'm here hearing some divide talk on the duration of the optional practical training like the 17 months STEM extension is invalid.

Please consider this as an serious issue and try to re-solve out this problem as soon as possible so that many of the international students who have come over-here from many other countries over-seas will be benifited from the continual process of the STEM extension after OPT period for one year by having more and more practical knowledge by intern-ships in our own domain. So that it will be helpful for each and every student even if they go their home country they can apply this knowledge and get good jobs in their perspective streams. Hoping that the government will take a positive step which that is helpful for all the students.

yours sincerely,

Sam
