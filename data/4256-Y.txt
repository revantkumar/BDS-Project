I strongly support this proposed rule of improving OPT for STEM students because the following reasons:

1, This proposed rule is to attract foreign students with highly talented technology skill to contribute to US. The students with highly desired skills in STEM field, in which field the US is lack of such candidate, will be more willing to work in US because of this proposed OPT extension rule.

2, The secrete of US's leading position in the world is attracting talents from all overall the world, and this proposed rule will strengthen US's leading position in technology and thus boosting the economy by technology.

People who are against this rule have concern about the foreign student's competition in job markets. However the overlap in job market between the majority US people and STEM students are very small as the hottest majors for US students are not in STEM field such as Law School and medical school.

One suggestion about this proposed rule is the proposed mentoring mechanism. I think this will increase the workload of students, employer and immigration officials because everyone has to track the status. The time for preparing all the paperwork can be better spent in actually training the students.
