GREAT UPVOTE on this!

OPT and the extension really helps international student to practice working skills and better fulfill their dream, regardless if they choose to work in U.S. after OPT period or not. 

International student has been limited to work through the years at college, and they do not have equal opportunity on getting a job. It's even harder to get an h1b which prevents international students from working. In this case, having OPT extension is really helpful to STEM students to move on with their life. I think this is a very wise and positive move to have OPT extension again.

For those who scare that OPT students would take their job, there is surely no worries about this. Just by working hard and being a U.S. citizen, one would have got any job he desired already.
