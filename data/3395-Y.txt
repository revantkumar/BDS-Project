I strongly support this rule for the following reasons: 1. The proposed rule would help ensure that US's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States. This is not to say that domestic students will have less opportunity to enter into and complete a degree program. Universities, especially in the STEM field, need many talented students to diligently learn and carry out researches. Despite many funding sources available to US domestic students, there still are't enough domestic students to maintain the research institution functioning. To alleviate this problem, measures need to be taken to attract and educate more domestic students in the STEM field, but not to halt the program that would temporarily fill the gap of the lack of domestic students. 
2. Same reasoning can be applied to the job market. Positions need to be filled up with experienced workers. It has to be filled up with foreigner only when there is no domestic worker competing on the same level. Those who graduated from US institution with STEM degrees committed their several years of life in education and were often working on projects funded by US organizations/companies. It will unfavorably affect US economy and national security if those talents are returning to competing countries. Policy should focus on supporting US workers to be trained at low or no cost to them, either part-time or full-time depending on individual situation. While this takes time and cannot be done at all levels, temporarily filling the gaps with US trained STEM students is certainly an effective measure at the moment. 

All in all, OPT extension is an effective way to attract the talents to stay and to help US economy grow.
