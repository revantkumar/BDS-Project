As a potential graduate student in US, I strongly support this proposal. I think US should expanding OPT for F-1 students with the following reasons.
First, most of the F-1 visa holders with STEM degree are talented and future's elite. They can make contribution to the economy and technology of US. 
Second, F-1 students are still minority of the college students in US. 
Third, attracting more educated students and experts to US, especially from China, India and other emerging countries, is in line with American interests. 
Forth, the competition among F-1 students with native american can push the society and economy of US forward. 
In summary, F-1 students are beneficial to US. In my opinion, US needs to attract more F-1 students. Expanding OPT is one way to attract more overseas students to US.
