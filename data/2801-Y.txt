I can not disagree with this rule anymore. 

It's ridiculous to say international students grab the jobs from U.S. citizens. A large number of companies only employ American citizens and do not provide visas for foreign students. Local citizens have a significant advantage over foreign students as proficient English users. Foreign students have to work very hard in order to get involve in the work visa pooling. Those people are truly welcomed in job market all over the world. If we can not leave them working in U.S., we would suffer a huge loss. 

Certainly, there are few American youths willing to study science and engineering. How can we continue the lead without the support of foreign students. If this OPT extension rule did not pass, I bet, there would be few foreign students study in U.S.. As a consequence, I can predict that in next decade, the Nobel prizes will fall in China, Japan, India, and Europe, instead of America. Without the progress in technology, we had better make preparation for the twilight of the high-tech industries. At that time, you can see more laid-off American citizens than foreign students who we reject today.
