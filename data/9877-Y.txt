OPT extension with STEM Degrees for F-1 students is a great!!! It WILL NOT deprive opportunities of our local students, because the number of local students in these majors are far below the industry's actual needs. This policy actually benefits not only F-1 students, but also the employers and thus, the US economy! The United States owns the most top universities in the world, and we have reason to believe that the students graduates from our universities are the best and wisest people who could make great contribution to any companies they serve. Why don't we let them serve our companies first in the condition that job opportunities of our own students are guaranteed? That is why this extension is made for STEM only. We can definitely have international students' contribution as well as ensuring local students' job opportunities in these majors!!! Three year is reasonable for a nonimmigrant student to stay and work, otherwise it might be too short for them to do some real work because we usually have to train them first which may take up their most OPT. So please!!! IT IS A REASONABLY AWESOME POLICY!!!
