I totally support the idea of increasing the OPT extension period to 24 months from 17 months.Also, I think the DHS should also consider giving a grace period of 90 days instead of 60 days ,after OPT expiration date and allow students to work upto atleast 30 days after the OPT expiration. This will help students to have enough time to go back to their home country or to figure out alternate options for their living. In conclusion, I strongly support the idea of extending OPT extension period from 17 to 24 months.
