I cannot see the wisdom of expanding training opportunities for Foreign Non-immigrant Students with Stem Degrees. In this age of high unemployment of American citizens, it does not make sense to be expanding opportunities to non-citizens. If we were operating in an employment environment of endless opportunities, (low unemployment), I could see the wisdom of helping foreign students. But we are not. This proposed rule only appears to remove employment opportunities from our own citizens, and unfortunately can be viewed as a cynical ploy to undermine this country.
