Adi Vaidya International STEM graduate student here, just presenting my perspective on things.

There's a common view here that the STEM extension is particularly for the purpose of a bridge to an H1-B or further. The whole part about this being a logical extension to the studies of an individual gets totally ignored in this debate.

- While I cannot speak for other fields, there is a clear need for industrial experience in order to accomplish or learn anything worthwhile in tech. A 2 year masters, or 4 year degree barely covers the basics of what one learns on the job. The biggest attraction for a student to study in the US is the opportunity to work and learn from the best and brightest around. This also attracts the best and brightest fresh minds to commit significant time and huge cash reserves to study here.

- Education in the US is expensive. Even more so for out of state, international students. The opportunity to work softens the blow of massive loans that we also need to acquire for this. Please note that most tech companies back home are either incapable of training or unable to provide the highest level working environment for new graduates . Both cases apply: for an above-average student, the training periods are what makes them great. For the true born talents, they need the atmosphere to survive.

- From the perspective of retaining talent in the US, I do understand the apprehensions of locals. But looking around in the tech industry, a very very small percentage of workers are American (barely ~10%). Most of the workers are on H1-Bs, or Green cards. Denying a STEM shortage is plainly foolish. 

- The real source of frustration here seems to be the H1-B program that gets abused for hiring the lowest pay rung of workers for high-skilled jobs, bringing them on from foreign nations. That is not even remotely the case for STEM students from the US. For a fact, these students are extremely talented, and clearly the top 1% of talent from countries with significantly greater competition than the US. You really want to send these guys back in a year?
