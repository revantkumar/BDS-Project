The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.

I find this offensive and discouraging! Why would this happen when America has so many of its own citizens out of work -- millions! It's time to stop the stupidity and put Americans back to work. Many Americans don't make enough money to take care of their families and many more are unemployed. So again why would Homeland Security propose something so foolish!!!

Stop the madness!!

Sincerely,
