The OPT program is appalling. It denies skilled Americans looking for jobs in Computer Science in preference to foreign students and with only nine months of study. As a computer science student from 1979 through 1984, I could not even get a job in the field until after my junior year outside of the University. The program rewards companies with incentive when doing so, when an abundance of job seeking American students are available. Being pro-business does not mean that companies should be rewarded for being bad citizens. Companies need to hire and nurture Americans first. The program undermines the best corporate practices and encourages greed. The program also undermines the good that we do for other countries when their most gifted students come here, get an education and experience our country. When they return they help their country, and the U.S. tends to have a friend abroad. It helps create trade ties. OPT undermines all of that. This particularly in that students want to stay, and making all kinds of exceptions causes a feeding frenzy for foreigners who want to come here. It is time to take care of Americans first by increasing job opportunities here, decreasing poverty among Americans and expecting U.S. companies, and foreign companies here to be good citizens and residents.
