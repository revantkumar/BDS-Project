It is a sensible proposal to extend the OPT program.

If we object to international scab and job thieves, we would need to close our doors to all international students altogether.

Truth be told, even if we scrap the OPT, some will still find employment. The ICC is a case in point.

It is those underhand shenanigans that need to be punished, not the majority international students.
