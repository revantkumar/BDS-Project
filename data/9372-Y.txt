I think we should oppose to the Indian Consulting Companies(ICC) and illegal immigrants rather than the international STEM students. It's obvious that keeping the STEM students benefit much more and harm much less to the Americans than keeping the ICC workers and illegal immigrants. Why?

The international students pay high tuition fees to support our education system and those STEM students who graduate and find a job from here are high-level talents for the tech industry and science research field. I don't think they have any problems in finding a job in their home countries or other countries if we kick them out. However, the Indian Consulting Companies transport tens of thousands of low level workers who not even have a college degree from India or US every year and steal most of the H1B jobs, and the illegal immigrants are the main group to steal most of the low wage jobs. So why we are so mad of the STEM student rather than ICC works and illegal immigrants?
