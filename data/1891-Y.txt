Ke Li This OPT extension proposal is a great idea, it benefits both the native people and foreign students. The U.S. has lots of technology companies which make great contribution to the local economies each year. Without OPT extension, the 1-year OPT can only guarantee students to work for the U.S. companies for one year. However most technology companies usually spend at least 3-6 months in training new employees which means the foreign students can only make contributions the company for less than 6-9 months then the company has to find a replacement. This will cause billions of dollar loss for the U.S. economies. 
On the other hand, foreign people is not the reason that native people cannot find a job. Instead, without foreign people make contributions to this country's economies, GDP and tax income, a lot more people may lose their job because of economic depression.
