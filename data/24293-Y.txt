Those people who support the idea --- " stop 24 opt extension", are reaaallllly stupid!!!! I think many of yours are paid posters from certain stupid group.

Currently in the world, every country is pushing power to strength its tech and comprehensive national power. What is the most important factor? It is just talent !

USA is with outstanding education and we have spent plenty of energy on these talented people from all over the world. What is the end? We educated them and then send them as gift to other countries? Welfare? 

Some paid posters are killing the US economy to a extent. High tech position can create jobs, not the other way around ! Can you image the weak labor market after you cut off STEM OPT or they were fired causing a disaster on US industry and then deteriorate virtual economy? Don't shoot ourselves in the foot. 

The number of student who own OPT extension is just no more than 300 thousand, which is a small part of the labor market. Especially these are the people with good education boosting US economy, not the beggar grabbing money from your pocket. 

I don't understand why there are some people like to put the cart before a horse. Illegal immigrant is the problem you should focus on.
