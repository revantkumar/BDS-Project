Amy Westwood I strongly support this proposal!!!

1. It helps maintain the high quality of students for our universities. International students come to US because there is chance for them to do practical training after graduation. OPT is the most important reason that they come here.

2. It helps our companies to hire high-skilled workers. The state is in a shortage of qualified STEM workers. To maintain the high level of our technology, we need more talents from worldwide to bring new ideas.

US is strong because it has the best people in the world!!
