Extending OPT for stem students to 24 months is very important. 
First, it makes US universities more attractive. Without this extension, foreign students like me who studies electrical engineering, may choose Canada, Australia or other European countries as my graduate schools. It would be great losses for US schools if OPT extension is not approved.
Second, it is unfair to have only 12 months OPT as a stem student. It is widely known to foreign students that nowadays, there are more qualifiers than the number of H1B issues. If one fails to get H1B through lottery, without OPT extension, he/she must leave US. Hiring such a qualified employee for some technology companies is not an easy thing, this will influence the development of both science and technology of US.

Third, a lot of science or engineering research projects are not simply 1 year based. Take me as an example. I am working on a 10-year National Science Foundation supported research project now and it is impossible to finish within just one year. If opt expires in 1 year, my employer must look for another person to replace my position. But it would be time consuming and it may be hard to find another appropriate person which is competent for this job title.
