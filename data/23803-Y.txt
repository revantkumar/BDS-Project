I got my B.S degree in Physics from University of Nebraska Omaha, and I got and my M.S degree in Mechanical Engineering from Binghamton University (SUNY at Binghamton). I'm a Chinese, and I got my first full time job in July, after I graduated in this May.Now I'm a Mechanical Engineer, but I do not have H1B Visa yet. I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Firstly, I paid and got my Science degree in this country, I believe that I have the right to seek a full time job and stay here to gain working experience and money. I have a plan to go back to China, but I really need more working experience. Degree means nothing, I cannot find a good job in China with only science degree and without any working experience. For engineering students, academic and industry are two different languages. Secondly, we really do some work that most of your American people cannot do. For example, I am the only one simulation engineer in our company, and I am the only one who know how to use Abaqus to do finite element analysys. My job requies a good mathematics skill and advanced engineering knowledge. Most of American engineer in our company just know how to use Solidworks to create 3D model. So I want to say, lots of company related to engineering and industry really need good international students work for them. In other words, because you need us, so we stay here. If all of the STEM students go back to their own countries, I don't think you have enough American students can handle everything.
