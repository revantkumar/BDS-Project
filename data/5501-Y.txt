Albert Xia I strongly support the proposal of OPT STEM expanding, mainly based on the following benefits it would bring to the US:

1) Technique workers, coming from the STEM students, are already an important working force for many techi companies in the US. Continuing to attract brilliant minds coming to US is important for keeping the American techi companies enjoy leading roles among their competitors outside of US.

2) Foreign students can also help provide corporations they are working a diverse understanding about the global market. This understanding will help the US companies continue to enjoy their leading roles in the global market.

3) Keeping the foreign brilliant minds working in the US also serves to potentially reduce American techi companies' foreign competitors.

4) The fresh graduates who would apply for the STEM also cost less to employ both for US companies and the society. Comparing people with years of experiences, they ask for less pay and can contribute creative fresh minds. For the society, they pay taxes but do not enjoy lots of benefits coming from the taxes. 

5) As mentioned in 1)-4), US companies benefit from employing foreign students. And they can/are using the benefits to create more jobs in the US.
