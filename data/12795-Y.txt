I welcome whole heartedly this new rule regarding the extension of opt period. This extension would give international students more opportunities to interact with the experts during their training period this new opt extension would benefit everyone equally. Opt extension would encourage more international student to study in The United States of America which would help in building economy of The United States. Opt may be the only reason for many international students to study here when compared to countries in the Europe. So this new rule for the extension of opt in the whole will give a positive result.
