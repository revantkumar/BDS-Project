With so many U.S. citizens either underemployed or having difficulty finding work in their technical fields why do we give employers an incentive to hire foreign students over U.S. citizens? The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their HOME COUNTRIES WHEN THEY RETURNED. Today it seems it is being used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S. and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. We currently have around 568,999 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire workers from this pool undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers. Is this being used by employers to reduce their labor costs at the expense of American workers? Using the OPT program to get around immigration laws is unacceptable. Giving foreign students an unfair advantage over American citizen students is unacceptable. Please deny to proposed rule change by the DHS to expand the OPT program.
