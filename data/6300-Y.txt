Ray Xie I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. After all, those students are love to stay in the US and low security issue. Think about the tragedy in Paris...

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, it is also a great chance to attract talented student to stay longer and make bigger contribution.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. America needs talented student to boost their economics, not the average student to help them maintain the current situation. Image how large amount of student left US to China. Does the government really want this happen?
