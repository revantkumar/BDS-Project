Rick Smith I will totally SUPPORT this proposal.

I think it will give more opportunity to all america company and bring them more competitive power in the global market. Because all those OPT employees are already show that they are strong on the field they work on when they got this job. 

Some people may think it is bad idea to let those foreign student compete with native student. But I hold the believe that by introduce those compete will bring long term benefit to our nation. not only because those excellent OPT students may stay in USA and also let our native people work harder and study harder to fit such a competition. And our nation will keep prosperous on both our fiance and quality of life.
