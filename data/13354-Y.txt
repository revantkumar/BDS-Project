This country was built from immigrations from all over the world. Many talented people from other countries have worked or are working hard here since many years ago. Specially people with STEM backgrounds, they are the keys driving the technology moving forward. Losing all those people due to the visa problem is really an unwise decision. Although they represent a small portion of the population, but they are no doubt the most talented group of people around the world, usually with and advanced degrees from US universities. US shouldn't create a hole for itself and let talents flow to other countries. 

Also, more importantly, more majors should be considered as STEM majors too, like Economics related major. They are also highly math skills needed majors and a lot of great talents with solid science background are pursuing degrees in these fields too.
