I am a recent graduated PhD student working in a research facility in United State. I totally support the STEM extension regulation. In biology researching area, most post-doc and fundamental researchers are come from foreign countries like my collages in the same laboratory, and most of US are using our OPT period to continue our research. However, most of our project from NIH or NSF are 2 years or even longer project. If we do not have the OPT extension time, most of the national science project can not be done, since it will cost much more time and money to change researcher a middle of the project. So in conclusion, the OPT STEM extension regulation will do a big fever for researchers in US and make a great contribution to US development in science field.

Considering the benefits for US citizens I stated above. I strongly agree to preserve STEM extension policies and even increase the extension period.
