Heather Knox I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. This will ensure continuous supply of young talented STEM graduates and promote growth of science and technology. The additional OPT time will provide STEM graduates with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
