I second this proposal.

1. International students are the very best students from their countries and tried really hard to make it here. Most of them who choose to stay and work in the US are the best of the best. They have lots of potentials and capabilities that many US companies need. The cancellation of OPT would be disaster for many US companies, especially IT and high tech companies. The lack of employee will definitely be a negative factor to US economy and American people's interest.

2. International students will definitely bring diversity to US, which generates new ideas, creates new products and create more international-based jobs like foreign restaurants, tourism and create many demands and opportunities. US companies and citizens will benefit financially.

3. In fact, the wages of many international students who manage to find a job is not low. My friends who manage to stay in US are those who did a great job in their university. Their wages is definitely above the minimum wage. It is these international students that create more value for US economy, which eventually will help to increase the minimum wages.

4. Of course there will be competition. However this kind of competition will not be a real threat to US citizens. This kind of competition is productive in nature, which helps US students do better in university and helps US companies find "the" person for the job. This competition is overall productive and positive.
