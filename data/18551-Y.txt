MOST of the H1B visa petitions are actually from OUTSIDE of US! Over HALF of H1B visa are given to applicants from OUTSIDE OF US! THEY DO NOT HOLD OPT AT ALL!

OPT is only a temporary visa status for qualified talented student workers, only less 40,000 of them remains with H1B visa. If you don't know what this number means, compare it to about 11.7 MILLION immigrants who are living in the United States illegally (according to NEW YORK TIMES)!
