Strongly supporting this !!!

Most people putting down a comment here don't understand what they are talking about. They are mixing "Daily Job" where you work at Disney/Gas Station/Mc Donald's for 10 dollar an hour to a STEM JOB that we are discussing here.

For the ones stating that "Government is trying to offer job to Internationals and there are still many Americans without job". Ask yourself first, are the Americans who can't find a job has the SAME EDUCATION, SAME ABILITY to work as an international who get a STEM JOB?

You can never stop one from being STUPID. From the logic you put down on your comment, and your ability to understand this proposal, you really need some more education.

Let me teach you guys some basic rules while making a statement. 

Your comparison has to be parallel. You can never compare an Apple to a NUT! 
If, there are a tons of American college graduate with STEM Degree cannot find a job, then yes, there is some problem with this proposal. But the case is not. Most of STEM Major American students get a good job. 

During the process of job hunting, I have at least get 50 phone calls ends with my question"Does your company sponsor international visa". We all had a good talk on the phone and they all wanted to provide me a on-site interview. My opportunity is gone, just because I am an international. I believe this is the case for all of us here.
