This OPT extension is really important for our international students, it is the only fair thing for us finding a job achieve the American dream. Because when I found a job the HR would ask me do I need a sponsorship, I said yes. And most situation is we can not go on talking about the job thing, because they would not willing to offer that. Only the OPT extension can give us more chance and time to prove ourselves, or we have nothing. US people the god gives everyone freedom life and fair world, why not this time?
