It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students` legal right to work in US after graduation. International students are making huge contributions to US. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according toe the Partnership For A New American Economy. Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, H1B holders pay more than 27%, and often more then 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people.
