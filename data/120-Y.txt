The OPT extension rule should definitely be approved. I've read a few of other comments which oppose this rule. I believe they don't understand the real meaning of what they are saying:

Living in San Diego and have an 18 yo son who still cannot find an entry level job anywhere. he has even applied to fast food chains despite feeling uncomfortable working there because he was the only non-hispanic english -speaking youth. Now looking for over 13 months. As a result of the constant rejection he has become quit hopeless and depressed. He is a good kid with morals, polite, well-spoken, integrity, clean-cut, and with good grades. He is giving up because he just does not know what to do anymore to get a break.

-- Being polite and clean-cut won't secure your son a job. Working ability and good education will. Besides, OPT is for students to receive practical training beyond what they've learnt in their major. No STEM student studies "fast food chains" major and compete with your son on these job opportunities.

"This OPT Program must not be expanded. It should be ended completely. It is taking American jobs and giving them to foreign nationals at the expense of American workers. Further, it is robbing the Social Security System and Medicare System of needed income tax revenues. What idiot thought this was a good idea to begin with? It must end!"

-- Students employed under OPT pay the same income tax as US employees. They pay tax to contribute to the US medicare system while not benefiting from it at all, because they are not US citizens. 

"Support education for USA citizens. Support all types of jobs for USA citizens. Let the foreign governments support the education of foreign students. Let the foreign governments provide jobs for their own citizens"

--The United States has been attracting the most talented students to bring productivity, creativity and innovations to its land. The Chinese and Indian government are desperately trying to attract these talents to study and work in their own countries, so that they could beat the US company competitors, and relocate businesses, factories, technologies, and job opportunities, to their own countries from US. 

"I'm against the expansion of foreign , aliens, UnAmericans & anyone who believes in Sharia Law to stay in AMERICA after graduation. 60 days or Deported. Our government is giving ALL FOREIGNERS A FREE EDUCATION, FREE HOUSING, FRE SUBSIDIES & FOOD STAMPS.
I AM TIRED OF MY SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY BEING CUT TO SUPPORT MILLIONS OF FOREIGNERS. VETERANS & TAXX PAYERS ARE BEING THROWED INTO POVERTY TO SUPPORT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. MUSLIM OBAMA IS GRANTING AUTOMATIC CITIZENSHIP TO MUSLIMS. WHO ARE THROWING THIS COUNTRY BACK TO CAVEMAN ERA.
WHERE EVERY SICK ACT IS LEGAL THROUGH SHARIA LAW.
CLOSE OUR BORDERS, MAKE MINIMUM LIMITS TO ALLOW IMMIGRANTS TO BE COME CITIZENS SWEARING THEIR ALLEGIANCE TO AMERICA.
Is birth certificates needed that much to over populate the United States into bankruptcy ?"

--The OPT students are LEGAL and NON-IMMIGRANTS. They each pay the University more than $60,000/yr to study at an US university. They pay by themselves for food, housing and traveling, bringing huge revenue to the US restaurants, house owners, airline companies and such. If we discriminate foreign students and Muslims in the way this commenter suggests, we are repeating the mistake United States made to the African Americans in history.

I've read through many comments opposing OPT extension, not a single one makes too much sense. What I see is people blaming foreign students to find excuses for the unfortunates of their lives. Canceling OPT extensions will harm the foreign students, US companies, universities and local businesses. But it would not benefit these commenters at all, just like sea water would not benefit a thirsty man.
