I do SUPPORT OPT extension for migrant students, for two reasons.
1. The OPT extension enables students to stay in US for internships or short-term working opportunities, which greatly contributes to the growth of US companies, especially in technology field. Without those students, these companies may face the risk of losing a lot of workforce. It is definitely not good for US industry.
2, The OPT extension would not harm US people's chance to get jobs at all. Because of the working visa limits, students have to leave US after three years. The number of positions for domestic students does not change at all!
