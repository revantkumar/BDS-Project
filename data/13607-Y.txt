It is well known to all that US is a immigration country which has benefited a lot from millions of immigrants since it was established. International students are undoubtedly treasure to this country because they help to solve the labor shortage of skill workers by many high-tech companies and improved the competitiveness of these enterprises. Granting them the right to work could never decrease the job opportunities of US citizens. The companies which are located in US would like to consider international students only when they don't have any qualified or appropriate citizen candidates to fill the job vacancy.

For the second point, international students who are majored in STEM majors usually master unique expertise and skills. The extended stay after their graduation allows them to create startup companies which might provide thousands of job openings in the future. There have been a lot of such cases in San Jose, New York and Seattle. From this perspective, the work chances for US citizens are not lowered. Instead, they are increased!

To conclude, I strongly support the rule for extending STEM OPT to 24 months. US will continue to benefit from this policy because it is in the best interest of this country.
