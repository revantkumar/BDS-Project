This isn't fair, we come from different parts of the world spend thousands of dollars and now we are being kicked out of the country. Getting a job being a foreign student itself is not easy and now my future is uncertain. I see my dreams being crushed looking at all the other peoples comments. We just want to learn more develop and help my society weather it be in my home country or here in US. But kicking us out all of a sudden will help no one.
