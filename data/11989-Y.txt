I STRONGLY SUPPORT this new policy because international students have made significant contributions to the economy of the States. They pay a significant amount of tuition, house and apartment rent. They get groceries from US supermarkets, shop clothes, electronics at US stores and eat at US restaurants. A friend of mine is a restaurant owner, and she told me more than half of her customers were international students. She earns money from them and enjoys hearing from them about world cultures. She says it's horrible to imagine someday there are no longer international students eating at her place.
