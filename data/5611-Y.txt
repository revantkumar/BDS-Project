Ningtao Hu In my opinion, the point "OPT extension for STEM foreign students will take away American people's jobs" is unjust, unsubstantial and shortsighted.

Firstly, the OPT extension plan for STEM majors is a effective way for Unite States of America to attract talented people worldwide, and the definition of "talented" DOES NOT EXCLUDE American people. The foreign STEM students who are able to get employed are usually brilliant and talented in aspect of their professional field. High-tech companies care about the genuineness and talent of their employee more than their citizenship and not everyone is competent for these jobs. By having this international-friendly policy, it will not affect American's employment. On the contrary, it may stipulate American people to be more active in STEM fields.

Secondly, by having more talents, we can maintain America's competitive advantage among all the other countries. A large number of foreign STEM students are from India, China and Russia, who are major international competitors to America. If they are not taken by America, they will be very likely taken by their own countries. Shutting them out by not giving their legal rights to work in America is just like doing a favor for our competitors and giving away our existing advantage, which makes rejecting this OPT extension policy not a wise move on behalf of America.

Lastly, foreign workers do make contribution for America's economy. The economy growth is not simply reflected on GDP numbers. It can also be reflected on new jobs. Hiring talented people regardless of their citizenship can accelerate the development of many industries, creating new jobs in long term. These opportunities are for everyone, including American people. Therefore, foreign workers are not necessarily reducing chances of American people, it can help instead.
