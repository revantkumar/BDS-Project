Lang Xi I strongly support this policy. OPT extension policy not only give international student a chance to have great opportunity in the U.S., it also give U.S. a chance to select the talents across the world. As what recently president Obama said in the TPP announcement: If you don't do this, others will and others will surpass you. In this small competition world, these talents also can have great future in their home country!
