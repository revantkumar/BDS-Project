As an international student in Computer Science, I STRONGLY support the proposed rules:
1. The STEM program is one of the most important factors that attract students from all-over the worlds to come to the US to study. As far as I'm concerned, Canada and Australia issue permanent residence to international students as long as they get a job after graduation. The STEM program that provides similar opportunities for international students to practice the knowledge and skills after graduation keeps the US universities competitive globally. For my case, the extension of the STEM means that I'm able to become more competitive in the job's market when I come back after working 3 years in the IT industry in America.

2. Moreover, the STEM program helps the US keep a leading role in technology and economy. Many successful leaders, like Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, Kai-Fu Lee, formal Google executive, started their career thanks to the STEM program. The STEM program has proven its value by encouraging talents from all-over the world to come to work and make the US companies successful. 

3. The extension of the STEM program doesn't hurt the interests of local Americans at all. Even with the extension of the STEM program, it is not easy for international students to find a job. With the disadvantages in language skills, international students need to work extra hard to get hired. As a personal matter, I spent all my time in studying and sharpening my programming skills, even at weekends. I know God only helps those who help themselves and I believe hard work does pay off someday. I sincerely welcome the proposed rules as I'm prepared to contribute my skills to make my future employer successful.
