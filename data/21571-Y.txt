I strongly OPPOSE this rule as an international student for the sake of my country. This rule will deteriorate both the talent drainage and outflow of US dollars from my country. 

A) In my country (China), people who got fellowship from graduate schools in the US are really the most elite groups of students (top 5%). Personally, it has always been an emotional strike to realize how many of these talents are serving the good of US, and expanding OPT will further shrink the chances for them to come back, because the extended rule will grant them extra time to establish their career and finish the green card process in the US. They should be deported back to serve their home country immediate after the education.
