It's a great idea to extend the OPT extention. Foreign STEM students have contributed a lot for the economy, especially after the economic bubble caused by the Wall Street. And it is ridiculous to blame them for the 'lower salary'. Given the poor finance status, companies have to decrease the salary. If the finance status keeps like that, it is still hard to increase the salary. However, foreign students can change this situation. Look at the boom in high tech industry after the Wall Street fell. You can see how international students matter for current poor economy.
