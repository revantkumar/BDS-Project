Yue Fei I support the proposal strongly. Because US companies need international students in their global expending. 

Situations in different countries could vary widely. Having international students working with this difference would help US companies develop their global business quickly and efficiently. 

For example, if Internet streaming media such as Netflix and Hulu want to expend their business in China, there is a huge need of employees who familiar with situations on both sides. Because Chinese online media rely more on advertisement while the majority revenue income of Netflix is paid customers. This requires marketing, sales, and engineers have deep understanding of local situations and at the same time could communicate with headquarters at US. In this case the role played by international students is irreplaceable. 

So not only STEM students need this extension, but also students majored in marketing, accounting, etc..
