I support the new policy. The extension will help US technology sector absorb more qualified graduate and undergraduate students with STEM Degrees. With the H1B cap lottery system, the STEM students have a high probability of working or obtaining training in tech industry for less a year, which will significantly limit their contributions to advance the technology in US.
