I definitely support OPT Extenstion! When I decided to study in America, one of the reason is to gain some industrial experience before back to my own country. 

Some people think it's unfair for Americans to find work because of the competition of foreigners. However, based on my experience, I don't think we take the opportunity from Americas. When my friends or myself apply for a job, if the company knows that we are not citizens, most of the time they will not give us an interview regardless of how outstanding of our academic background is. We need to spend more time and make more effort to improve ourselves to compete with US citizens. We usually applied for 100 jobs, 10 companies maybe give us a phone interview opportunities and only 1 company may give us an offer regardless of our citizenship. 

Americans should know that if you cannot find a job, it doesn't mean foreigners take the opportunities, it means you are not eligible for the job. Most of my American classmates are 10 times easier than us to find a job after graduation if they are smart, with good GPA, having some internship experience. 

Try to reduce the competition is not a sustainable solution to help you feel easier to find a job. Compared to the total annual graduates, F-1 students occupies a very small part. The competitors you mostly fight with for a job are Americans! Instead of struggling to prevent this rule based on finding a shortcut to help you find a job, the best way is to improve your competitiveness!
