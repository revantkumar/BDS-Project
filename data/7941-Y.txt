I strongly support this OPT STEM extension proposal because of following reasons:

1. This policy are helping people with high advanced techniques and education to have chance to make continuous contributions to America where they were educated. 
2. Competition will be helpful to stimulate the whole America economy.
3. Freedom and democracy.
