Wenhao Ge Chinese students are very creative and intelligent in STEM majors, once we can get more time to 
Practice our skills after graduation, Chinese students are very likely to make great contributions to the development of American economy, technology and many other fields. Besides, it is American spirits to offer equal opportunities to Chinese students who are pretty good at their studies. United States is an open- minded country, I firmly believe United States will not give up so many intelligent and creative Chinese students and let ten leave United States, so this stem extension proposal is necessarily to be passed by USA.
