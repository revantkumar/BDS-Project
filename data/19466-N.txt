This is a program we can no longer afford, our citizens are not able to find jobs after graduating from college. ICE can't monitor them, and many become criminal problems, with some bent on bringing a potential for terror with them. Financially,OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs, that's 696,000 in addition to their dependents. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.OPT was meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans. It is time to bring this program to an end ASAP.
