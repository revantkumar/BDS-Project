The 24 months OPT extension for international students will benifit the US society a lot. These students can make huge contributions to the development of science and technology of US. The employment of US residents is not due to these students with knowledge and technique, because job opportunities in the STEM area are still a lot. Without the STEM extension, the development of science and technology will greatly slow down due to lack of smart labors. As a result, many US residents will lose their job because of poor economics. And, the tax from these international students is of huge amount, which in turn is benefiting the US residents and the whole country.
