I support this. If we can "accept" more than 11 million undocumented less skilled immigrants why can't we let thousands of highly educated people come and help our economy? They are paying tuitions before graduation and they are paying taxes after graduation. I don't see a reason to stop this rule.

U.S. has always been a country that welcomes contributions from everyone around the globe. That gives us diversity and makes us stronger.

Please pass this rule. Thank you.
