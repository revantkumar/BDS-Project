Wing Sum Cheng As a current F-1 OPT STEM holder, I strongly support the improvement and expansion of training opportunities for F-1 students. Having completed the university program and one year of on-the-job training, given the limitation in getting H-1B in recent years, I can further contribute to my company in the coming years with the F-1 OPT STEM improvement. On the side note, my salary is extremely comparable to any of my American peers. The impact on US labor market is thus very limited, but the benefit for companies will be tremendous.
