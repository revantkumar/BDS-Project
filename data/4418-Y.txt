Erick - I SUPPORT THE EXPANSION STRONGLY.
1. This act is not good for international workers, it's for TRAINED, HIGHLY EDUCATED international students. I feel sorry but if the unemployed Americans want a job, they need to be at least same qualified. 
2. The unemployed rate since 2000 has always been around 7%. During 2013-2015, the time when the number of international students boosts, the unemployed rate actually dropped from 9% to 5%. So we know it's not the international students who are 'stealing' the jobs, it's the economy. And without the STME OPT workers, US economy will face another great difficulty. 
3. US is a country of immigrants. It feels so hilarious to see all these people, who's father or grand father was an immigrant, saying that they don't want any international workers here. For me, better international students with STEM degree rather than illegal, undocumented ones.
