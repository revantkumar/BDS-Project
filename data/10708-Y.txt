I think this is a great proposal and should definitely carry on.

U.S is a country built and developed by talented and hardworking immigrants. Diversity and freedom are what this country is proud of. This proposal is a perfect indication of the spirit. More practically, this policy will help attract more talented young people to come to the US which has a direct, positive impact on the country's economy and a long time influence on the country's future development.
