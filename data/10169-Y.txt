As a parent of international student who study at U.S, I argue that it is unjust, shortsighted and reduce the interest of majority international student to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation. Reasons are following.

To begin with, when my son graduated from his university in my country, I wanted to invest him a more valuable,and hence I decied to sent him to obtain his master degree at abroad. After that, I did some researches and enquired many related people which finally lead me to U.S which contains the best quality of education and the gold opportunity for their students. I do consider that the right of every student should be the same, I think my son ought to get the same opportunity to find job in U.S as the american students find job in our country, especially, we spent numerous money on his master and phd degree. For a work-class, it is amount of money, if he has to come back at the same time when he graduate, I think we may not use many money for just giving his an memory. Hence I think this policy is not fare enough.

In addition, there are a plentiful parents around me want to sent their children go to america becasue of good reputation in education, as far as I consered, it also is a good thing for american economy since more international studetn, more money they can bring which also allows local government to create more working places for their local citizen. Therefore, it is not paradox between expending OPT and local working-freezing.

Finally, I really wish that the U.S government can consider my advice as represent of many international student's parents.

best!
