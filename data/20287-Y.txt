All of us were trying so hard to use our knowledge to contribute to this society and this country. I don't understand those other people who never study in stem or even being able to finish a single math course are telling us that we are not worth to stay here. They never be able to do what we are doing and they think they can controbute more to this country? These people, your target should be those illegal immigrants but not us, the ones who were sacrificing their time and life to contribute to this country. These is no reason to kick us out of here. We need this opportunity and we need this extended OPT. It's not only for us, it's for this country, for all the companies.
