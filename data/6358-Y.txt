I'm floored to think our President would support this type bill. Enough has been done to the American worker - companies
moving out of the USA - illegals taking our US jobs. Foreigners answering customer service phones that can't be understood,
due to poor English. Haven't we tolerated enough. The samples stated is just "the tip of the iceberg".

I'm so disgusted to think the President continues to force passage of such bills before his term ends. He continually strives to
hurt the our great country in any way possible!
