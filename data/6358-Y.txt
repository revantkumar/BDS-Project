Aparajita Bhattacharya I strongly support the STEM 24 month extension proposal. This new rule will allow skilled young STEM graduates to stay and contribute to the society in the United States for a longer period and give them a chance to apply for H1B visa in order to work long term. The US has always been a welcoming place for talents all around the world and this is what makes it America! Let's continue the tradition and allow the hard working foreign scientists and graduates to give America their best, while America gives them its best! Please allow this proposal to become the new law of the land.
