I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because many high tech companies would hire foreigners for some basic works, which can also contribute to tax. If the OPT is only one year, students have to go back to there countries soon and it will be a great loss for those companies as well as a great loss to American economy and technique level. Besides, more foreigners will enhance the efficiency of work.
