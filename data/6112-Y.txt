Linda Meyer The proposed rule on EXPANDING the OPT program should be nipped in the bud. It doesn't make sense and runs contrary to original intent. For starters, we have an unemployment problem. There is NO shortage of STEM workers in the US. There is a shortage of cheap labor wanted by Silicon Valley and big business - thus the desire for expanding the program. 

Why in the world should we give a break to companies to hire foreign workers? Why should they be encouraged to hire illegals vs Americans, and get a tax break to boot? This is ridiculous. EVERYONE should have to pay into the SS and Medicare trust fund. 

I am angry that this rule is even being considered. Its nothing but a freakin handout for big business. I am tired of it. It has to stop.
