Mohit Jain The new rule will be very helpful to the brilliant students who left their countries, families, just to come here, study under guidance of excellent professors and then work at great companies. As H1B selection is so random, it is only fair to such brilliant students to get multiple attempts to get H1B and continue to work here in USA. 
The americans who feel like these immigrants are actually stealing their jobs are not correct. Because of such brilliant minds, new researches are being conducted, opportunities are being created in United States which in turn will create more jobs for locals too. So I completely support this move of having 24 months of OPT extension for STEM students.
