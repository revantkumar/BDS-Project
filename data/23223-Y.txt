I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. First, one important reason of the fast development of economy, technology, and cultural diversity of US is that we have the open-minded and attracting policies which attract many specialties and talented students all over the world, especially in the science and technology areas. Besides, It's needless to say that the non-immigrant students bring to the States a considerable portion of economic growth. And more attracting policies surely contribute to it. Also, if the government shows a negative attitude to non-immigrant students studying and working in States, many companies, including some dominating ones in some areas, will suffer from the loss or shortage of employees and even experts and rare quick adjustments are possible to reduce the loss in a short time.
