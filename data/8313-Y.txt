I support the new rule, it will give a great opportunity for international students to explore their areas of specialization in the industry after completion of studies and also contribute to it which will eventually contribute to US economy.
Besides, the quota for H1B should be considered to be made in reasonable amounts as compared to the number of applications this currently is not in reasonable ratio.
Scrapping this rule will only discourage young talents to come to United States for higher studies which I am sure is not something that anyone wants.
