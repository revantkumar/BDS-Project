I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. 

STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world.International students participation in the job market itself would increase competition in the short term. However, in the long term, competition increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest. 

Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tremendous growth to economy. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before we becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen. 

DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.
