I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1) US has invested tremendous money on educating those talented foreign students. If they have to leave this country because they can not have a working permit, this is a great loss of the nation.

2) It is the influx of talented people to US from around the world that shaped US the leading power in the world. 

3) Allowing foreign students to work in US will boost the growth of small business in various sectors.
