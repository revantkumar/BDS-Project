I strongly support this rule.

This act would obviously benefit America by providing American companies with better people and improving the American workers' abilities during the competition with people from other countries.

WATW seems to be concerning about American workers, but are they really this nice? They are in fact short-sighted. Companies hire international graduates because they are equally good or better than the Americans. What if they are not allowed to work in America? They would go somewhere else to contribute their talent. What's more serious, American workers will be lazy with the protection of WATW. IF the act cannot get approved, America will very likely lose its advantage in the world by losing talent and well-educated people.
