Although I am a foreign student currently involve in a STEM program, I really did not care about what the result is. However, after I saw all these non-logic comments, I decided to write this comment to support this regulation. I have the following reasons to support my argument.

1. U.S. is known for its equal opportunity, and it is this embracement that attracts the talent people around world to make this country better. Without this regulation, lots of talent students will simply not get the job because they don't have the luck to get the working visa (you don't easily get working visa by applying it, you still have to go through a lottery to get the working visa) For those who against this regulation, do you even know the process to get a working visa? We are limited by so many factors to apply for the working visa.

2. Extend to the first point, the one who can apply working visas are the ones that smart enough to stay. Although some people can abuse the system, most people who can apply for working visa are the ones that smart and can contribute a lot to this country. 

3. All my undergraduate American classmate in my STEM program got decent jobs, but we foreigners are still limited by so many rules and regulations. We can stay only if we demonstrate even higher ability in order to stay. For those who can stay, why this government still trying to limit those peoples' opportunities by not passing this regulation.

4. For those complain about the opportunities, 1. do you have the abilities to replace those smart ones that gets kicked out ? 2. Who complains about limited opportunities in graduate or PHD program, did you work hard enough in your undergrad an d you GRE or GMAT test to get to those program? The school is always picking the candidates that succeed the program. 3. Those smart foreign workers are the ones making this country better and provide taxes to those who don't work hard.
