Joan Love The "OPT" program is a bad idea. It puts foreign students ahead of our at home local students that also need more help to be integrated into the business realm. And to pay businesses to bring in these foreign students, whom they will pay a below average wage, or none at all is a super waste of our tax dollars. And, most of all, I highly resent this program using moneys taken from our all ready depleted Social Security Fund. I have paid into this fund for many years. I did not put money in there for you to use for programs that will undermine this ONCE GREAT COUNTRY! Joan Love
