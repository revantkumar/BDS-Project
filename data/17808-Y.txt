I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 

Lots of international students come to US universities not only for education program itself but also for the OPT, because many of them could get working experience from industry and become experienced backbones in their companies later. And this proposal will further enhance the academic benefit provided by STEM OPT extensions and increase oversight, which will better ensure that students gain valuable practical STEM experience that supplements knowledge gained through their academic studies, while preventing adverse effects to U.S. workers. Without OPT, I personally guess lots of students will prefer other countries rather than US. A lot of US citizens get scholarship but do not forget universities get a lot from international students. 

At last, don't forget ancestors of all citizens were immigrants. US needs the talents among international students to be the best country all over the world.
