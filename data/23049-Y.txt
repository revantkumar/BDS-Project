We foreign students are providing tremendous help to the economy. I started working at my current company with several other equally qualified Americans who were recruited at the same time. My company is pretty happy with the value I created. Several former foreigners, who are citizens now, are at some key positions in my company. Their reputation is diligent that they never make mistakes. We created values and help the company booming.
