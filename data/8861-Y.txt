Yukun Chen, PSU I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1) This proposal will increase the value of an American STEM degree dramatically. More talents around the world will be attracted to come to U.S. Because they are attracted by the opportunity to be hired and use the knowledge and expertise they gained from the universities after the graduate. With all these talents, the quality of graduate program in U.S. will stay at its leading position in the world.
2) This proposal will benefit U.S. economy. STEM skill equipped labour are critical to U.S. economy. If we cannot attract those STEM graduates to stay and contribute to U.S. economy, U.S.'s valuable graduate education resource cannot be converted to production output. What a pity!
