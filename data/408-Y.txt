All the unemployment figures that people are putting here are wrong. Yes there is unemployment but it is not because of STEM graduates. In fact they are contributing towards technological growth of the country and they are actually creating more and more jobs. They are helping us and here in some comments people are against this rule because they think STEM grads are taking their jobs which is totally rubbish. Please wake up guys and support this rule. If you want to decrease unemployment in this country then we must support this rule.
