I strongly support this proposal since it benefits both the science development of America but also the people that live in this country.
First of all, International students are one of the major part of the STEM industry, with their intelligence and diligence, they hold great position no matter in school or in different companies. For example, the total revenue of Google is 66 billion in 2014 and almost 83% of its employees are international workers. Due to the original policy of opt intension, they are able to profit the company for the most and promote the development of science for this country. Keeping this policy and extend the opt time for 24 months not only gives them more chance to apply for the H1B Visa but also keep the fresh blood for the development of different industries.
Secondly, it is ridiculous that some extremists think that the international students take their job opportunities. For most of the majors in stem, international students is the main components of such majors which the domestic students are less willing to attend and most of them outperform than the domestic students in such practical fields,such as computer science and electrical engineering. If the extension is canceled. The lack of talented people in IT industry for example, will goes its way down in the long term and American will lose strength in national defense and security.

Thirdly,the average salary from H1B last year is about 100,000 each year. They pay average about 15 percent of their income to US as tax. We all know US is in big amount of debt for this social welfare which gives its economy a trouble. If we keep those young people in our country and let them keep paying taxes. It will release the financial burden of US significantly. With the taxes paid by opt users, we can build a better medical system, build infrastructures, reduce poverty and support for interesting scientific research.
