I strongly support this rule. As we know, the OPT provide a opportunity to international student which makes them could work in US for a while. The work experience in US is very valuable for these student so they willing pay more tuition than the local citizen to study here. Their tuition can contribute to the college development. Their living cost can promote the local economy. If they have no OPT then they can't work here, it is greatly possible that the international student won't come to study in American any more which could bring bad influence to American's education funding and economy. 

US should attract more talent international student to study here so It is definitely necessary to extend the OPT.
