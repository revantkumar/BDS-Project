I totally SUPPORT the proposal to extend the OPT for STEM major international students. I am personally a student major in engineering. I have seen so many talented international students worked in US companies and made contribution to US economy. In fact, according to reports available through NAFSA (Association of International Educations) it has been estimated that international students and their families have contributed $26.8 Billion to the US economy and created or supported 340,000 jobs during the 2013-2014 academic year (http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/eis2014/Massachusetts.pdf). The data show that international students actually create more job opportunities in the US, not taking the job position. For those who oppose the proposal because they are afraid that international students might take their job need to look at the data first.
