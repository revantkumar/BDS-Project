It's a sad day when OUR government is actually working AGAINST us and plays corrupt lapdog to greedy, morally bankrupt corporations.

The proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. There IS no labor shortage in America - only greedy corporations that want CHEAP labor. There are MILLIONS of unemployed Americans and I work in Silicon Valley - I KNOW. Corporations are badgering for increased visas for foreign workers for ONE reason.....GREED! They can pay them less - it's that simple. Don't tell me otherwise, because, as I said - I work at these companies and I SEE it all the time.
