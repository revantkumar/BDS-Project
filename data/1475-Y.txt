I strongly support this proposed rule for the following reason:
1. It would strongly improve U.S. economy as more and more talented students would come to U.S. for a great education experience. 
2. It would also increase diversity in the U.S. society, allowing more openminded business in the future. 
3. The world is running by communication. Students are the most young and active mind of a country. Therefore if U.S. provides them sufficient and extraordinary working experience that allow them to apply their knowledge in the industry (practical situation), it will not only improve the industry (and related field) but also improve overall business and relationship with the corresponding country as well.

Overall, as far as I'm concerned, this proposed rule would not only benefit the foreign students and U.S industry but also improve U.S relationship with other countries and the national image of U.S.
