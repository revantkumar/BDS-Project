Qian Wang I definitely support this new policy for the following reasons
1.The new OPT 24 month extension proposal highlights the employment equality, which was articulated as one of the most important principles in the Declaration of Independence. And this equality atmosphere would lead US society to harmony, prosperity and peace. 
2.Ever since the economy depression in 2008, more and more domestic companies are seeking business opportunities outside of US, while later oversea investments have brought huge profits to them in return. Therefore, those companies have to hire foreign students who have bilingual proficiency and cultural/social background to work with them for further business development and expansion. 
3.The new opt 24 month extension targets for foreign students with STEM background (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), which are unpopular majors for native students compared with Economics, Law, Medical science and Business Management. Since native students have a decreasing interest and enrollments in the STEM majors and the total amounts of native graduates cannot meet the extra demand of recruitment from companies such in the IT and manufacturing industry, companies have to hire foreign students with STEM background to make up for it to avoid job vacancy and huge financial loss. So this OPT 24 month extension policy will provide more opportunities for US companies to choose from qualified foreign candidates to bring benefits and competency.
