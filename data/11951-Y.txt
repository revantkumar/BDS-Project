STRONGLY STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE!!!

The objection by most commenters are BLINDED and simply pointing to a WRONG group! What really takes the job opportunities from American workers are those who applied work visas abusively from overseas directly. Out of the 65K quota for H1b every year, tens of thousands are simply taken by the few indian consulting companies (namely Infosys, Tata). Due to the abusive behaviors overseas (some even filed 7-8 petitions using different companies just to increase the chance of being picked in the lottery), the chance for a student with advanced degree in US has become notoriously low (probably only 20% for a bachelor degree, and 40% for MS degree or higher, and this is expected to be SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER in 2017 Fiscal year, if no actions taken to deal with these abusive behaviors of multiple petitions in the H1B lottery).

The fix to the H1b system is NECESSARY with no doubt! Unfortunately, there won't be any solution in a short term due to the notoriously known slow legislation in US. This new ruling is effective to provide students in US the fair right to work for US companies without any interruption in their practical training or worry about work authorization issue. The objection by most commenters should be towards the BROKEN H1b system- which has brought a lot of Indian "technicians" into US to consume the training resources in US before they can actually work competently and directly compete with graduates from US universities. Actually, students that have completed studies in US need to be protected rather than be blamed, to improve the quality of US productive power.
