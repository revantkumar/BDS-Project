OPT is interim immigrant status, itself won't affect US job market significantly. However, OPT extension allows international students in STEM more opportunities to work here and stay here, which is capped by H1B quota system. So as long as H1B quota system exists, OPT won't affect the US job market at all.
As a matter of fact, a very large portion of the H1B quota are occupied by overseas workers who never received American education. Compared to them, international students in STEM contribute to this country a lot both academically and financially, and will continue to contribute because they are trained in the extraordinary education system of the US. 
Brain resource is invaluable in modern society, and it is not something that can be industrialized. Sending STEM students home means sending brain resource away, however, these brilliant brains won't stop thinking just because they are not in the US. They will develop great software, they will found great companies, they will explore new technologies, all outside the US. This will affect the US job market then, after all, job stays where companies stay.
