I strongly support extending the OPT. You have spent lots of time teaching and training us. Why wouldn't you allow us to use our knowledge and skills to build your country better? 
Extending OPT would attract more international students to come here. We all know our tuition have brought vigor to the economy of the United States.
Equal rights to everyone in this country. Isn't this the fundamental idea on which this country were built?
