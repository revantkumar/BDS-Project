I strongly agree that OPT STEM should extend to 24 months. As people all know, the proportion of students with OPT STEM is getting larger and larger in many important fields. For example, in two biggest banks I have been working in-JP Morgan Chase and Citibank, almost 90 percent or even above in risk quantitative modeling and analytics teams are foreign students who graduated with Math or Statistics master or PhD. It is very crucial to keep them in these positions because they have excellent and expertised skills and very diligent working attitudes and risk team is getting very important after financial crisis. I know that in some other areas like CS or Enginneering many many foregine students with OPT STEM also play critical roles. They gained US scholarship when they were in graduate school. It is wise for the U.S. to keep them after spending that money on them! They are contributing to the development of the country. Government has no reason to give them chances to leave the country!
