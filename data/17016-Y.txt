I strongly support this proposal. I'm currently working for an IT company and hiring a good software developer is really hard for my team, org and the whole company. My team has an opening which cannot be filled for more than one year! 1/3 of engineers in my team are currently using F1 OPT STEM Extension to work in US. Many projects of my team will be delayed without them and company cannot make as much profit as now. The products of our company are changing the way how American people do shopping, reading, and entertaining. Some of products are used by US government. Without F1 OPT students, our company cannot launch that many worldwide popular products and grow so fast in recent years. The growth of our company brings more people to this city, creates lots of job positions for local people and improves local economic development. 
In our company, the compensation for F1 OPT students isn't lower than US citizens of the same level at all. Our company even pays more money to hire lawyers to apply for H1b visa for F1 OPT students. 
As far as I know, US is the the first option of most international STEM students when they apply for college or graduate school and the most important reason for that is with OPT and STEM OPT extension they can work in US using the skills and knowledge they learn after graduation. The coming of international students drives the local economic development and ease the financial burden of universities, especially public schools.
In summary, not only F1 STEM students will benefit from this proposal, but also all the US people will definitely benefit from it.
