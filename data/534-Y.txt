This is wonderful news to a lot students and is very welcome. This should definitely put into place because the highly trained students with masters degree will contribute back to the US economy in terms of productivity and also in the form of taxes. That 17 months will be extended to 24 months makes this proposal all the more wonderful.

But this should not be misconceived as a way to hire cheaper labour by companies here and discriminate against equally qualified americans. 

At the same time this should not be used as a means for under and un qualified students to enter and pollute the united states. The trend where students with meagre gre scores given visas to enter usa is quite alarming. 

Care should be taken that both parties(F-1 and american citizens) are dealt with justly.

As an F-1 student with excellent academics, and who upholds all the values of the american sovereignty and it's values. I fully support this new extension as it will help the us government also get dollars back into the country, making the dollar more powerful.

If the F-1 opt extension is cancelled, it will inhibit students from pursuing degrees in USA, even those who do come here, will be forced to go back to the another country if they fail to get a H-1B(given the huge number of applicants and the lottery system), so USA will be losing out valuable talent. 

This F-1 extension is good for both USA and F-1 students. Also it will give rise to healthy competition where more individuals will pursue higher degrees and thus there will be more qualified individuals for companies to choose from.
