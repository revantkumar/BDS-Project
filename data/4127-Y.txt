I strongly SUPPORT the proposal!
The STEM OPT extension helps the foreigners with higher education background and top-level talents better serve US industry, academia and economy. Without OPT extension, many talents just left this country which is sad. Those guys contribute a lot to US industrial, educational and economical interest. I believe the extension from 17 to 24 months will strengthen the power of US science and technology and boost US economy in the long run. One example, in CA IT industry, lots of foreigners that are still in OPT STEM status. if OPT extension was cancelled. Facebook, linkedin, apple/amazon, and google will be affected thus US economy will be greatly affected.
