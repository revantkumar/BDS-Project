International students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.
-Strongly agreed. United States is a country where dream comes true. As an immigrant country, it has witness the power and energy derived from different people, different culture, different background, which contributes to the overall boosts of technology. It's time to pay attention those foreign talents. They need the opportunity.
