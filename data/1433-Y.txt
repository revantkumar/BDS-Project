To whom may concerned,

Hi,
I highly recommend that the OPT should extend to 24 months. 
This is a bright decision and will bring a bright future to a lot of companies including, technique company, pharmauceutical industry, hospital, school.
Now, I work for a pharmaceutical industry. There are a lot of job opportunities that need people who are expert in programming, statistics and chemistry. As the company developing, The demand of these people is getting bigger and bigger. But not many people are interested in this area. What's more, some foreign employee may lose their jobs because their visa status. What a shame, a developing company lose its people who may make big contribution to the company.

24 months is better than 17 months. Think about it, when people are just getting familiar with their jobs and the company think highly of its employee. But 17 months comes, these people need to go. What a loss! 

I hope it will work. 24 months extension is really a wise decision. 

Thanks 
Emma
