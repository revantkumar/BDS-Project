I strongly support this proposed rule because it shows US embraces diversity and that makes US the strongest country in the world. Improving the OPT extension would allow smart people from all over the world comes to US to make US even better. Throughout the history we can see governments that close doors to foreigners and did not accept diversity always ended up becoming communist or fascist. In order to prevent this from happening, US must embrace diversity.
