I really think improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students is essential.

On the one hand, this policy matters so many students because the proportion of F-1 students in University is so high. Take my university as an example, I am a Chemistry student from Wisconsin. The international students rate in my department is almost 20% here, not mention the rate of Math department. So, this policy really matters.

On the other hand, we deserve a policy like that. The Chemistry department of my university is so excellent and the contribution we could make after graduation is countless.But our fates are still decided by the drawing lot, even thought we may have the chance to get Nobel Prize.

Therefore, it is necessary to improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students. In that case, we could have more chances and more time to prove our value, which also matters so much to the development of American.
