Vijaya Rani Medikonda I support the idea of 24 months OPT. As USA is always in implementing latest technology a substabtial duration would help students to practice what they have learnt during the course degree of a degree otherwise many of the students might not get the chance to develop in the area that they have practiced in their home country which puts much of their efforta to incompletion. A 24 month worj time would rather boost up their morale to take up opportunity with more confidence.
