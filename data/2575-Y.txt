It is important for both the country and eligible F-1 students to obtain the 24 month extension. The immigration policy of U.S is not fair for people who are talent and passionate about their contribution to the country. This extension can help the country to improve it. Let's compare the contributions of the refugees from South America and the students with higher education who are eager to fulfill their dreams in U.S. To be practical, the refugees can bring nothing but the bills for the government which is not responsible for taking care them. But the talented students can use their skills and intelligence to make this country a better place to live.
