ELAINE MCMULLEN I absolutely, vehemently agree with the previous post. in light of the savvy skills and intellect the STEM holders wish to bestow upon Americans and our culture; enhance and enlightened their own countries with their knowledge and skills. Why are we seeking to put our employees and youth out of work at the expense of foreigners subscriptions? To give them something something unavailable in their country, then change internally their countries oligarchy societies. With all of the vast knowledge of the Visa holders, STEM pro-advocates, intellectuals, tech savvy folk, apply it to their own countries. The world has changed. Our enemies are knocking at our doors under the auspices of training, skill enhancement , education and mass immigration. 

Do our own children not have a future here.
