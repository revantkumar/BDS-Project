I strongly support the proposal. This proposal would save the decreasing competitiveness of the United States. 

More and more STEM and other highly educated students are going to further their study in countries beside the US. And US is losing its competitiveness because other countries are providing better offers. My cousin has chosen the University of Manchester to study Electrical Engineering while he was also admitted by Vanderbilt University. This is because in UK, with compact course schedule, he can get his degree in less than 15 months, while in US it would normally take 2 years. Many of my collage classmates are now in Germany pursuing their Master's degree in EE. They only need to pay 200 euro on registration, and their tuition is covered by German government.

Highly educated students and researchers are key to a country's competitiveness and creativity, but what US has done is not enough. If US failed to pay STEM and other major students a better environment, US would lose in the long run.
