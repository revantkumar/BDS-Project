To whom it may concern:

I think the OPT STEM Extension should be extended for 3 more years. The reasons are as follows:

1. It will profoundly benefit United States. Those STEM students are people who have the talents to make profound contribution to this country. The 3 years contribution from them can really make difference for the country than only one year short training.

2. It will dramatically benefit the companies where the STEM students work. Most of the projects in the company need 3 or more years to finish. It will be a disaster if the company loses the students before the project is completed.

3. It will benefit the local economy. Within the 3 years in United States, those students will have a considerable amount of consumption, which will benefit the local economy.

4. Three years of OPT will attract more students to come to Unite States for education. 

In summary, the three years OPT policy will boost the economy which will create more job openings. People living in the country will directly or indirectly benefit from this policy.

Thank you,
