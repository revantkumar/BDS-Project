I've been working in a tech company as a HR for several years. Based on my recruiting experience, these international workers are well qualified for the job. They did well in the interview, worked hard during the job and brought great value to the company. We need these people to work for us. I know some domestic people are concerned that these people will be competing against them in the job market by lowering their salary rate. Based on my experience, these tech workers are not the case. They usually work hard and get reasonable salary. From my point of view, this new rule is gonna be very helpful for the tech companies.
