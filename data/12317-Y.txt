It is such a pity that you are having this words posted here. I don't know how old you are, what level of education you have, but you are being very politeness. We foreign STEMs students have no competitiveness at the job field at all compared to you citizens. Companies will always hire a citizen before a F-1 student, because they won't take the risk of immigration problems, either. If you are being unemployed at this point of time, I feel the same pain as you do. We are trying hard to live better, we don't even have time to go through this discussion on line. We'd like to spend our treasure time on valuable studying and working, I do wish you feel the same.
