the United States is a country belongs to Democracy and Liberty. As a F-1 student graduated from STEM program in USA, and attend expanding OPT program it will be benefit for American indeed. 

Let me explain: 1. International students with STEM degree can bring unlimited knowledge and innovative thinking to American companies and society. We are working for American people and society, we are bringing creativity and wealth here. 2. the United States needs diversity, this is American culture. 3. When a OPT student working longer here, after he/she back to his/her country, he/she can bring deeper American spirit there, this is benefit for International cooperation and American international policy. 4. We get expanding OPT that means we are spending more in USA, this can promoting the economy, stimulating consumption....

Expanding OPT will bring wealth and opportunities to American people!
