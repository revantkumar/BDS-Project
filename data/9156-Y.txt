I support this proposal. This proposal helps international students to have more chances to get green card and become citizen, which will increase the society's diversity.

Also, this will increase the competition in the job market, makes the employers have more selections and take use of the cheap labor.

Besides, this will attract more students choose US to get education, since the immigration opportunity is much more great than other countries, like UK, Japan, and German, who also have superior education system.

In conclusion, as immigration population has long become the engine for US to grow and sustain, I strongly support this proposal!
