I strongly support this rule. 
Why the America can attract the most talented people from all over the world? It is because the america can provide the most equal opportunities to all the people in the world. Every year, many international students come to the US to pursue their dreams, and after that, many of them devote themselves to this country. 
The history told us that what make the US the most powerful country in the world? only the american born person? maybe not. The international talents have made a huge contribution to this country. 
So the US need these talents. Please pass this proposal.
