My wife is an entrepreneur who is trying very hard to create more jobs rather than competing with local people for jobs. However, her OPT is almost used up and is now facing some problems with her visa status. If she could have more time, she will definitely build up her company and hire more people. In fact, I know many foreign students who is very talented entrepreneur and come to this land of opportunity to create even more opportunities for people already in this country. Why not give them a little bit more time so that everyone can enjoy a much better live together?
