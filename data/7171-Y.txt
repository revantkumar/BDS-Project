I strongly agree with new OPT extension. I think the new rule is good for both U.S. Citizen and foreign students in STEM, it is a win-win decision. Foreign students help bring lots of profit to high tech companies, and then high tech companies can hire more employee and promote the national employment. For OPT extension, international students can only go to companies with E-verify, so they won't be a threaten to U.S. Citizen in work field.
