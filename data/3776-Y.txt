I live in Sunnyvale and my 2 tenants are international students working for Google/Linkedin after they graduate in this May. They have decent job and pay their rent timely. It's a great idea to give those people extension since they have been important part of the local economy. In addition, they're paying way more tax than average. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't keep them longer in our country.
