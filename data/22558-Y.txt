I recently met a girl in Jacksonville and She is studying for her STEM degree. IF she can't find a job after she graduates ,which is very likely to happen, and If this propose is rejected, she will not be allowed to stay in the States. I will be a "single dog" FOREVER!! For the happiness of the rest of my life, please support this propose.
