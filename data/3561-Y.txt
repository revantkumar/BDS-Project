I fully support this proposed rule!

I am currently an international senior student in engineering and I received full-time offer from an American company. Besides engineering background, the position that they offered also requires good understanding of cultures in both the US and the country that I am from. The company has factories in different countries around the world, and they are willing to hire engineers that are eligible to communicate with people from those countries. If F-1 students with STEM degree are not allowed to work in the US for a long time, many US-based multinational engineering companies would have problem finding suitable workers to tackle communication obstacles, and in return, the inefficiency of those big companies would certainly hurt the economy.
