F1 students leave their country and come to the United States and work hard to earn their degrees. This is mainly because of the better education and opportunities that the educational system here provides. Please keep it that way. The US economy and companies that hire F1 students will benefit from a favourable ruling,i.e,an extension of the STEM OPT period.
