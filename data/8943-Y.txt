Ben Smith Sending home intelligent young graduates educated at no expense to the USA is perversely against American national interest. America has an unparalleled competitive edge due to her cultural dynamism, pragmatic love of technological innovation and market size and will continue to draw the brightest minds from around the world for decades to come. To take advantage of that competitive edge, it's important that the USA continues to maintain a viable pathway for international students to work in the US and contribute to the economy. Extending the OPT by an additional 12 months will give those students the opportunity to make real, lasting contributions to American businesses while they are here, better equip them to build business and foreign trade links with their home countries if they return, and give them more time to consider decisions about choosing to permanently make the US home.
For these reasons, I urge the relevant legislators and regulators to support the rule.
