I strongly support this regulation. In my opinion, this regulation highly benefits the US economy.

I am a restaurant manager who work near a high-tech company in downtown San Francisco. Recent years I could feel a sharp increase of revenue. This all thanks to growth of high-tech's company in this area. 

From news and reports, an increasing number of Chinese employees make great contributions to the local companies like Dropbox and LiveRamp. Also I know Chinese students now ranks No.1 of International students. Recently I have to employ another Chinese cook to make Chinese food. 

I hope this regulations could keep stay those students. All the Chinese restaurants nearby are making a great earning these days.
