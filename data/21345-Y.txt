This 24 mont extension in my humble opinion, is required for F-1 students, as with many companies, the process of getting sponsored is getting harder and harder. Many companies cannot sponsor F-1 students, simply because the duration of their work at the company is not long enough for the company to see the student's potentials. So, I strongly support this 24 month extension, as I see this as an opportunity for both students and companies, to get to know each other's potential and make a good decision regarding H1-B visa. Also, due to the nature of H1-B visa application, which is lottery based, I guess this 2 years increase the chances of the qualified students to get the H1-B visa, if they did not get it in the previous rounds.
