I strong support the idea of extending OPT to 24 months. 

Most F-1 students (specially with advanced degrees) have solid technology background and are very hard-working. F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields. They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world. A great example should be the new Google's CEO Sundar Pichai who was once one of the F-1 nonimmigrant students. Satya Nadella, CEO of microsoft is another case of F-1 nonimmigrant student case. Also, expanding the training opportunities won't cut job availabilities of US citizens but will stimulate Americans to improve to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.

In conclusion, this suggestion will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly.
