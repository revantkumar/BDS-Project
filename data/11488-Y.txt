The time duration of the OPT program should not be extended. Indeed, H-1B, L-1, OPT etc. should be reduced not increased. 

At a time of high unemployment and wage stagnation it makes no sense to let in large numbers of foreign workers. There is ample evidence that H-1B, etc. is being misused and abused. Recently workers at Disneyland and at Southern California Edison were being forced to train their replacements on H-1B visa. There have been many other layoffs at high tech companies such as Microsoft. US based employers should be hiring US worker before being allowed to hire low wage foreign workers. Also, H-1B, L-1, OPT workers almost always originate from low wage countries (forget higher wage Japan or Western Europe). It's illogical to think if there were a labor and skills shortage as employers often claim, that the crucially needed workers would be found overwhelmingly only in low wage countries. 

Extension of the OPT time limit is a step in the wrong direction for many reasons.
