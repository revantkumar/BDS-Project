I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. The 24 month OPT extension will benifit international students as well as the high tech companies in US. STEM professionals are highly needed and many of them are non immigrants. If this rule cannot be retained next Feb, thousands of employees will have to leave the country and thus have huge impact on the companies. Moreover, this rule is also a good way to attract students from all over the world to come to US to pursuits MS or phD degrees and bring talents and profits to universities.
