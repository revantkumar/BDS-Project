Last month, my econ professor asked us to write a paper concerning a current news with application of economics knowledge. I wrote my review of the opt extension. With the very basic economic conception, if the extension is canceled, then there indeed will be more positions for local students but with a lower salary. The cancelation of OPT does not benefit locals as much as expected, on the contrary, worsens the case. OPT is for students who were educated in the United States, so we should be given a chance to appreciate the country that takes us here today.
