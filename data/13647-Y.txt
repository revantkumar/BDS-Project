I believe OPT-extension is NECESSARY for our country. Over the years, foreign workers contributed to the US economy, especially in STEM industries. Many foreign students are talent and well-educated. They help a lot to US development. If US do not allow them to work here, our country will lose a large portion of growth. In addition, foreign students are a large group of consumers. They pay for rents, foods and living products. Without them, many people will lose jobs, and social problems will arise. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. PLEASE APPROVE the OPT-extension.
