I got an admission of a Computer Science master program Carnegie Mellon University and whether I wil go CMU depends on the final result of OPT extension. Personally, I strongly support OPT EXTENSION because I plan to have an intern at US before I go by to my own country. 2-year-extension will be appropriate. OPT the main attraction of STEM program in US's universities
