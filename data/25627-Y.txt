IMHO, this plan has far more positive impact than negative ones. 

1. The new policy will attract more talented international students to US colleges and universities. A lot of employers in foreign countries value the professional training experience more than the college life in US. The 3-years new OPT policy will attract more STEM students to attend US colleges and universities as the favorable professional training experiences compared to other European counties. Considering international students normally pay their own tuitions, this new policy can be a significant boost to the higher education industry in US, which provides more employments from local people. 

2. To maintain the leadership position in technology and innovation, US needs more talents from diversified cultures and backgrounds. Tesla/SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, google CEO, Sundar Pichai are great examples that how people from a different culture have advanced the technologies and created tons of jobs for US citizens. 

3. International students can also be great resources for local companies to expand global exposure. The new OPT program will allow students to build up network and credibility in the company. With a better understanding of the local market in foreign countries and language advantage, they can become a task force for US local companies to expand in a global market. For example, Uber China and India expansion teams are all led by people who started their careers through OPT programs. Now they became the leaders in Uber and help a US based company to expand in India and China markets, which in turn benefits US economy. 

These are just few key points came up in my mind. As the era of globalization, US needs more favorable policies to attract the best talents in other countries to maintain the leadership position in technology advancement. and the new OPT policy can be a good starting point.
