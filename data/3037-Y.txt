I Strongly support this rule:

OPT IS NOT AN IMMIGRANT PROGRAM!! THEY ARE NOT EQUAL. 
If international students could come to U.S for education as American children do, why couldn't they enjoy the same working opportunities as domestic students? And moreover international students under OPT still have limitations that prevent them from working in irrelevant position!

IT'S NOT SAFE ENOUGH TO SIMPLY CLOSE THE DOOR. Competition makes progress. 
Face it, challenge it, JUST DO IT IN AMERICAN WAY!
