I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1.STEM student studies knowledge from American university and the government should provide the chance for them to work and make contribution to U.S. 

2.Culture and language diversity are really important to U.S. As the development of world economics, American company have lots of chance to expand their business all around the world. Culture and language diversity from STEM students can be helpful in the process.

3.Lots of opponent said STEM students will compete with other American people and take their job opportunity. This is not reasonable. Competition does exist, but it never be a bad thing. Employer should have the right to make the decision about who is the best fit. If the STEM students don't have the advantages, 10-year OPT is meaningless.
