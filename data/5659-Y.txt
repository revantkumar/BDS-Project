Raghu Sri Harsha Rachumallu I strongly support this new proposal because it helps international students to gain more practical experience in their field of study by applying their knowledge in respective field for longer period. Also this contributes a lot to increase of US economy. This also helps in encouraging international students to come down to USA and there by causing increase in revenue. Development of cross cultural and cross geographical natures in USA may also be great results of applying this rule
