As a former non STEM international student, I oppose the regulation.

Since OPT stands for Optional Practical Training, I don't see the difference between 17 months and 24 months. Can the 7 more months significantly improve STEM students' skill? The only explanation is they can work for tech companies more and have more chances for H1B lotteries. 

However, only 85,000 H1B will be issued every year. This gives STEM students 3 lottery tickets while non STEM only have 1, which will lower non STEM students chances. Since H1B is for those companies who need specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialized fields, if a non STEM employee can prove that, he or she should be treated same way as STEM employee. That's all equal opportunity employer should do and tech is not an exception.
