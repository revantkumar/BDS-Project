This program is just another program that discriminates against American citizens and does little to help the foreign countries that these student come from.It takes jobs from qualified American citizens and gives them to foreign students of less ability. It even allows companies to make the American employees to 'train' those who will take their job. Just another example of bringing American citizens down while expecting them to foot the bills of President Obama's bright ideas.
