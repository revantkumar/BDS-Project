I strongly support the OPT extension proposal. Yesterday, I heard the news that UM president resigned due to he didn't probably solve the racism problem deep in the university. I don't know much about politics, but I do know that the diversity is core of the development of Unite States. For thousands of excellent foreign students coming to USA every year (among those,most of them are the best compared with their peers). There are numerous foreigners who came to this country and made significant contribution such as Albert Einstein. So, for those who are willing to contribute their knowledge, energy and passion to this country, I think the federal government should give them a chance to prove themselves. Otherwise, they have to go back after one year's OPT period (one year is really a short time to prove themselves).

Although competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing at all. Through competition, all the people can get improved. And this is exactly what makes Americans so GREAT. Only elites can survive in this society.

As a result, I strongly support the OPT extension proposal. I sincerely hope federal government can pass this proposal as soon as possible.
