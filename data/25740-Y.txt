If STEM students have more time to stay in US, they will make more contributions to US economy in different fundamental industries. This will also provide STEM students with more opportunities to make full use of advanced knowledge they learned in US universities. In the long term, all of these benefit US a lot. So I firmly support the extension of STEM OPT to 36 months. Thank you
