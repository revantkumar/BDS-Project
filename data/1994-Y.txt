The STEM extension benefits American economy by encouraging more international students to study and work in the technology and information sector. 

This is a field where talents are most needed. The STEM extension gives junior international workers in technology firms a better learning opportunity and so they can contribute more to longer term projects, which is often typical in technology. 

Moreover, in fields like Mathematics, where job prospects is less optimistic yet talents are sure needed, especially in US high schools, offering international workers more time to settle in their job is crucial. A lot of workers have to leave the country every year after the OPT. This is a loss to the American science education system and technology community.
