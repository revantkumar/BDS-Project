I am strongly support this rule. First, High technology stem students do not take US citizens jobs. Second, this rule will benefit US. If all the high technology students can not work for US, The ability of competing with other countries in a lot of areas and it will be a great loss for US. Third, if high technology students can not practice after graduation, in the future, less and less people will come to US to study, that's another great loss for US both in economy and high technology science area. Plus, a lot of high stem students educated by US, sponsored by US, if let them go after they complete their education, it is a waste of source and money of US.
