I strongly support this proposal!

It is those STEM students that make US so competitive in Science and Engineering today!!!

Without competition, every industry in US will suffer from productivity decline!!!

The right thing to do is encourage other US residents to work harder instead of expelling those talent 
STEM students!!! They are valuable property for US ! Please seriously think about it !
