I strongly support the extension of OPT for nonimmigrant students. I am now in the OPT period as a STEM student, and I am now facing with several job/postdoc offers. The common requirements for either the postdoc position or job position are that all the funding support/project needs ask for at least 2 years involvement. If the opt can not be extended, then the project for either US government division (NSF, NIH, DOE etc) will be influenced; and the project that will benefit US industry will be influenced. Before I come to US, I had several offers such as universities in England, Canada and Singapore. The important reason for me to choose US is that US government provide OPT period for international employee to work in US. For me, I plan to work in US for 2-3 years and go back to China and contribute my experience, knowledge to china. If the OPT can not be extended, then the originally agreed attractive rules will be lost. The US institutes will lose a lot of brilliant and top students from abroad and lose a lot of top-educated employees.
