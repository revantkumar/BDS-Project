I STRONGLY support this rule. 

Because it will help US attract more outstanding international students to study in US. And those students with advanced degree and knowledge can make huge contribution to US high-tech industries. In addition, those jobs in high-tech fields cannot be done by native Americans since they lack the knowledge and skills required by those jobs. That's why US needs this rule to attract international students with advanced degree to fill in those roles.
