Peter Zhang I strongly support the extension of OPT for non-immigrant students. For years US has attracted a lot of skillful foreign students/workers to keep itself advanced among all the countries, especially in the STEM related fields. Equality should be applied to all who is willing to contribute to the country, to the society and to the world. As a college staff, I feel it immoral to forbid competitive foreign students to acquire better training through the OPT program, just because those jobs should be reserved to the US citizens.
