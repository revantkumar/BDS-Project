I strongly support the new rule to extend OPT for F1 STEM student. There are a lot of benefits for this country and US economy. 

1. Extending OPT can help F1 students to setup Startups to increase employment by using OPT visa. Right now the time of OPT is too short for establish a successful Startup company.

2. Extending OPT can help post doctors to have more time to carry on researches and to produce significant scientific research achievements via OPT visa.

3.Extending OPT can help those well-educated F1 students have more time to stay US to help economic development and technology development.

US can allow tens millions lower educational illegal people to stay, why does US kick out those well-educated F1 students?
