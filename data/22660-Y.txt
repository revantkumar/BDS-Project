The new OPT-extension is a necessary measure to keep this country attractive to the talents it desperately needs.

First, absence of OPT-extension will force the talents already serving the US to leave the country, making a huge impact to the related industries. This will absolutely make the US companies less competitive in the market. The US workers will not be able to complete the jobs on their own, due to insufficient workforce.

Second, those foreign students, knowing that they now have a smaller chance to be able to work in the US, will try to find a job in other countries instead of the US. This will drastically make the US talent pool smaller. Those US companies will find it harder to get the right talents they need.

Third, having to leave the country will be very disruptive to those affected. Those affected could have family (may not be permanent resident) and moving could cause a huge cost to their family relationship, as well as their career growth.
