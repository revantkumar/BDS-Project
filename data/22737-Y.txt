I fully support this new regulation. My reasons are as follows:
US technology companies are heavily relying on foreign students from China, India, etc. If we do not have the new regulations, which means foreign students of STEM major who hold OPT only get 1 chance to get the H1B lottery. That means at least half of them need to leave US, which gives a serious hit on US tech company. So in order to let the technology companies in US grow smoothly and let the technology industry keep going well, we need to keep those foreign talent students who have the expertise.
