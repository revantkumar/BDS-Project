I am supportive of the new rule regarding the 24-month OPT extension for STEM students. This rule substantially reduces the losses of contributing foreign employees for US companies and ensures these companies to continuously provide high technology and healthcare to American citizens. In addition, this rule will encourage future foreign students in the STEM field to perform scientific research in the US universities. This is not only financially beneficial to US universities, but also adds cultural diversity and intellectual properties to the US universities.
