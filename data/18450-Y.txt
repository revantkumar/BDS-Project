Don't forget that the credit for US becoming NO.1 in the world should be given to its high quality immigrants though its whole history!

Extending OPT will bring in more skilled immigrants. These highly educated immigrants can make more contributions to US at a lower cost. First, they usually get their secondary eduction from outside US which saves US government a lot of money compared with US students. Second, mostly it is good student or rich student who can get a chance to come to us for collage or higher lever eduction, and they need to pay for their tuition. 

For those US citizens who complain that STEM immigrants take your job, I want to pointed out that if everything is the same for a citizen applicant and a international applicant, no company will bother to hire an international applicant, considering the company need to pay for their visa. The reason that US citizens may loss their job to international students is that they are not as competitive. Therefore they should not blame on OPT, rather they should spend more time to improve themselves.
