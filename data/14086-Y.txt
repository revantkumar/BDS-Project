The new policy will not only benefits the current studying international students, but also make attribute to those future ones, who are willing to come to US to pursue their career and contribute their effort to this land. 

What's more, to be the major support of the whole country, new fresh will participate in everywhere of the this country and bring what they learn and open-mind. The extend policy also will be a relax for those not 'luck' enough in the H1B lottery.
