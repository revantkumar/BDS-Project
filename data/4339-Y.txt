I fully support this new regulation. It could attract more international students choose to go to American universities. Schools are actually getting more money from the tuition. We pay higher price to get the same education. We deserve those extra working time to practice skills.

International students get less chance to find a good job since most American companies won't even accept international students. Most of time, we are competing with our fellow international students. We do not compete with Native American workers. You get far more opportunity than us. You can't get a job because other American workers are better.So, please do not stand in the way. Please do not use that excuse to fool yourselves.
