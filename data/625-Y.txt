Shengwei Yu This proposed rule is a step toward fixing the broken immigration system.

Taking the opt extension for example. It is for students that have jobs and been working for 12 months, and whose E-Verified employers are willing to continue hiring them. For these people, I dont see any reason why they should be turned away only because they were born in other places of this world. It is not only unfair to these students, it is also the loss of the employers that have trained them for a year, and the loss of the society as a whole who has educated them for several years and made them Masters and Doctors.

Training a skilled employee takes time and money, so does cultivating a well educated person who loves this country and is capable of making contributions to its society and economy. What a brilliant idea it is to force these people with knowledge and skills acquired here to benefit competitors in other countries?

When economy is not good and unemployment rate is high, those students can easily get H1B visa in 12 months and keep working. Now, the economy is good, unemployment rate is low, and tech companies need more qualified workers, but due to constant H1B visa cap, more than half of the foreign new hires have to be turned away.

Dont you see something is very wrong here? At the time we need more employees, you make it more difficult for companies to have them. And what is even worse is that the selection is purely based on random lottery! Come on, US immigration system, you can do better than this. Use your brain to come up with a real solution, it is not so difficult.

After all, it is the immigration system that is broken. Nowadays, opt extension provides the only work permit for most foreign students after opt expires. Increasing opt extension to 24 months is good move for temporary fix. After that, please keep going and work on the root cause.
