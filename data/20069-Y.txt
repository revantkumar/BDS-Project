STEM OPT extension should be passed. Since STEM students usually pay more taxes than non-STEM students. America is a immigrant country, I believe America should welcome technical talents rather than
born with a passport for long-term strategy. These people, who against STEM OPT extension, just think how much social welfare you get from these new tech immigrants.
