I agree with the 24 month extension for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. 
Many of those F-1 students gained master or Ph.D degree from our universities with 3-7 years scholarship support. We spent so much money in educating and training them. After their graduation, we should allow them to contribute longer time for our country instead of just kicking them out into other countries. 
Our nation is developing fast because we allow elites around the world to live and contribute to our nation. The international students, especially who achieved master or Ph.D degree from American universities are elites among their peers. They can contribute more than others. In many high technique area, we need new blood, new ideas. Without extension, the study experience will become less attractive for international students, in which way, we will lose many potential talents and send them to our rival countries.
Therefore, I believe the 24 month extension for F-1 students with STEM degrees is a wise policy for our country.
