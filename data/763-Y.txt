As parents of an international student, I fully support expanding OPT. To foster an international student in US is a big investment for all parents. How to gian the feedback from investment ? If STEM degree students could obtain 3 years work opportunity, they can accumulate not only the working experience, but also money to feedback his family as well. Meanwhile, they are contrubuting for the US high tech market as talent workforce. As intelligent work forces, they will devote their creative, professional and intellectual to US society. They also enhances US industrial diversity.
