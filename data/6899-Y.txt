Wensheng Sun I support the proposed rule to extend OPT period for international STEM students. Extending the OPT period for these students will bring huge economic benefits for the US society. 

First, data has shown that these students have significant purchase power and can make substantial contribute to the US economy. For example, according to the analysis of NAFSA (Association of International Educators), "the 974,926 international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $30.5 billion and supported more than 373,000 jobs to the U.S. economy during the 2014-2015 academic year." (These statements can be found at the link provided in reference [1]). The purchase power of these students not only come from their own needs, but also extend to their family members who might not stay in the US themselves. For example, they can make substantial amounts of purchase as gifts for their family members, or make purchase for their family and friends who otherwise do not have access to these products, or spread the information about products that their family members or friends might otherwise not know. Without the OPT extension, the number of international students will greatly reduce, so does the economic benefits and job opportunities created. 

Second, the participating of these students in STEM related jobs will greatly benefit US technology companies in developing products that target international markets. These students have unique knowledge about their own culture that US students typically don't have. Thus, they can better identify the needs of the international market, propose practical and efficient strategies/plans for developing new products, etc. 

In all, the extension of OPT is necessary for maintaining the benefits brought about by international STEM students.
