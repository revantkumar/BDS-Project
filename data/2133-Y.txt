Highly support this amended rule. It is necessary and beneficial for all's I have invested a lot of time and money in becoming a member of American community. Have paid taxes, helped American companies (through my job) and tried to blend in with American culture. Having studied engineering (computer science), I also feel that I can play an instrumental role in helping America innovate and move forward as a nation. I believe it's unfair to be promised 29 months of work (i've invested in multi year leases, furniture, turned down foreign jobs and also have to deal with the stress of leaving my friends and colleagues after being under the impression that id at least be there for 29 months not 12). 36 months would be perfect as it would enable me to complete my job contract.

If the notions of justice, human decency and forward thinking exist is this country, please approve this new legislation.
