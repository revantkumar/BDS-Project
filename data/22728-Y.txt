Hi, 

I'm very happy to know about the new proposal which was proposed by ICEB. I wish this rule will definitely help lot of students like me, with STEM degrees to implement our knowledge and can have more opportunities as they have good time of OPT extension in the proposed rule.
Hope this rule will get into implementation as soon as possible.

Thanks,
