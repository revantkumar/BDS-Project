America is one of a few big countries with sophisticated high tech and benefit a lot from those IT companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Linked-in, etc. Those companies create lots of revenue for not only their own, but also for the well-being of the whole country! We can see there are and will be a great demand for the IT people who dropped into the STEM. And those IT people could be provided some within inside, but also the majority from the international students. 
In addition, with the increasing number of applicants for the H1B lottery, the extension of 24 months of STEM will help those IT people who really contribute a lot to the country's IT economy future with their successfully planting themselves in this Promise Land. 
And I believe the foreign employees not really threaten the locals' job opportunities; with more and more people participate into the schools and job hunting, there must be a good competition among the people; more or less, people in this country learn how to study better, and work better, and live better! 
I would support this regulation, since we really need those people to help to boost the economy of America and help to create more jobs for people.
