Chaitanya Bhorade Hello, I am one of the tensed employee/student right now, who is worried about this bill. Personally, if the opt-extension is not approved, god knows how I am gonna deal with the debt of loan which I have on me. Me, being the eldest son in my family, could soon be losing his just started job. I want to work in the U.S.A mainly to give something in return to this country which gave an immense of practical knowledge. Now is the time, to apply this knowledge, pragmatically. Saving this opt-extension will bring joy to many students who are tensed right now and also to their families back home, who wants them to be successful and contribute to the U.S.A confidently. 
Looking positively for a positive response!!
