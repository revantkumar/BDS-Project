I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
The immigrant-friendly culture in U.S. has made it the best country in the world. And it is American spirit to give every one equal chance. Students who come to U.S to study deserve more time to practice their skills after graduation. It's also good for U. S. education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in U.S. And having talented foreign people work in STEM area is good for U.S. economy too.
