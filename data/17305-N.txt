US Census Bureau data shows about 11.4 million of 15 million Americans with STEM degrees aren't working in STEM fields. There are plenty of high-skilled American workers, but simply a lack of high-skilled job openings. How will these new regulations help American workers? Why should foreign nationals be given the advantage over Americans? Foreign Nationals are simply less expensive, they are NOT better workers.

In the case of H-1B programs, American corporations such as Disney and Microsoft are outsourcing their labor, explicitly aided by the US government--WHY? I know Disney and Microsoft do it to cut their labor costs, but why the US Govn't--how do they benefit? Don't American workers pay taxes? The more Americans bring home, the more taxes they pay. American workers can't benefit the US government if they're collecting unemployment.

These programs only benefit Microsoft and Disney. The US Government will lose tax revenues by allowing for more unemployed American STEM workers, and by driving down wages.

DHS should be focused on getting AMERICA back to work, not other countries. Worker participation rate in this country is the lowest since 1977--whatever the US govt is doing now, it's not working, and OPT won't help.
