Hello XXX,

As you may know, I came to the United States from India to study at University of Florida. After graduating, I was able to work here because of a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which allows foreign students to seek employment and develop their skills in their field.

The Department of Homeland Security has released a new rule extending OPT for foreign students with degrees in STEM. Basically, this would extend the period students are allowed to stay and work in the US to 24 months (it is currently capped at 17 months). The additional time is crucial for foreign graduates like me to begin working in their fields, developing skills, and finding employment.
