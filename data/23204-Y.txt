Strongly support the proposal.

1.This proposal allows employers to have more options when they consider who to hire. Without this extension, they would have more constraints in considering potential candidates.

2. Thousands of international students would be impacted and US universities would be less attractive to those who are going to apply for a degree.

3. Retaining talents is beneficial to the United States.

4. Currently, large companies hire lots of STEM international students.
