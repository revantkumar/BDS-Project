I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

It is time to put the American worker, and all that Americans have achieved for job and wage improvement over the decades first. We have become a nation that cares more for foreigners than for our own citizens.

I have 2 grandsons looking for work in the tech field. Both are young college graduates. This rule will make their job search much harder, when competing with students that the company can hire and pay less in taxes. It is not fair to American workers.
