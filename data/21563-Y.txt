I strongly support this proposed rule. The technology industry heavily requires highly skilled graduates. This demand cannot be met without picking talent from the pool of international students. These talented international students add more value to the US economy. I doubt that the tech companies in US would be this successful without its foreign origin workforce. We should be easing the avenues for these F1 students to be retained rather than drive them away. If international students are unable to obtain work visa, in the future very few international students will come to US universities, further hurting US economy.
