I am writing to express my strong support to the proposal of amending the F-1 non immigrant student visa regulations on optional practical training(OPT) for certain students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, ormathematics (STEM) from U.S. institutions of higher education. The reason as below:

1. The current 17 months extension would force high-end research projects to a hard stop.
According to a formal survey, the usual duration of a high-end research is 3-4 years to complete which is 36-48 months, much longer than 17 months and 29 months.The hard stop would lead to the lose of resource in our U.S. company and increase a huge amount of unnecessary costs to continue projects. 

2. F-1 Non-immigrant student is a huge and high quality resource for research, even though in business area.
They have a strong performance and competitive in conducting research, even though working in business environment. According to my personal experience, we can see the huge difference in skills, attitude and responsibility between F-1 Non-immigrant students. F-1 Non-immigrant student are responsible, skillful and passion, they do appreciate the working chances, so really paid off what U.S. companies and government have paid. 

All in all, there are a big amount of reasons that I and the U.S. society would strongly support the emendation of extending the OPT period for F-1 non-immigrant student, and even more, I would strongly suggest to open the OPT extension regulation to other majors, such as Analytic and Research. Students from these majors are also playing a more and more important role in supporting the improvement and fast movement of business, since the big data era is coming and the economic needs are diversity.
