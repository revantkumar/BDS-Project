I support the proposed rule.
1. America has been a country of immigrants since it was founded. And the diversity that immigrants brought in the past 200 years has been and still will be one of the most important factors to build a strong country.
2. A long OPT will bring the country more creative brains and laborious hands, which is a virtuous circle to America in both economy and education.
3. A strong country protects its people in proper ways. In a free field, especially fields like STEM, chance of fair competition will eventually gain the average strength of the whole field of America.
