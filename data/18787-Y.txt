I would like request USCIS to keep the extended OPT in place and increase duration if possible as it helps qualified students who have Masters/Doctorate to stay back and contribute to the US economy while improving their standard of living. 
This rules is a win-win situation for both US labor industry and international student and must not only be kept in place, OPT duration must be extended if possible.
