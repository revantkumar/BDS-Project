I strongly support the extension of OPT for the following reasons:
1. It is good for American economy and many US companies which hire international employees if the extension is approved. 
2. If the OPT period is only one year, many STEM students will have no choice and directly go back to their countries after graduation. It is very unfair for many foreign students.
3. For Phd students who want to search for postdoc positions, the normal period for subjects like biology needs at least 3 years. If the extension won't be approved, it will cause a lot of trouble in the visa problems for postdocs. If the international students who want to start with faculty career in US have no choice to stay in US, it will be the loss of US academic field.
