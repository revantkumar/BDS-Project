I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students," published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

As an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and graduated. My wife is also doing the same. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my wife's employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, she would need to leave the United States when her OPT period concludes and probably return back as a dependent which will forbid her from working. This will ruin all her dreams and plans.
The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates and I support this.
