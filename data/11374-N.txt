Americans need jobs. We DON"T need more foreign workers. It is time to rein in greedy corporations. We have our own students that need jobs. Look what greed has cost this country. Robots will be taking orders and the minimum wage jobs for school kids are gone. We need to stop welfare and maybe some of the lazy fools will go home. Also maybe some of the baby mamas will wake up to the fact that their kids might go hungry, and that is their fault. WE HAVE STUDENTS HERE WITH DEGREES AND THE ARE UNEMPLOYED!!!!!!! I hope we have some plan in the works with the next president to put and end to all of this craziness.
