OPT extension is important to both technical immigrants and the country. For almost every tech company in US, you can find foreign engineers making up a significant portion of the company, and they have brought billions of dollars profit. As we all know, the chance to get H1B visa is pretty low. If there's no OPT, lots of engineers cannot stay in US after graduation, and those tech companies will lose all those talents.
