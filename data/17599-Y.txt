I am a firm supporter to the proposal and as I went through the comments, I found many people just misunderstand or totally have no idea about what OPT is or who are eligible for OPT. So, when DHS officers check those comments, some comments with those following key words should be treated as INVALID comments.

Key word 1. Illegal. There are at least 5,000,000 illegal immigrants working in the US, but OPT students are NOT a part of them. ONLY less than 50,000 people work with OPT and they are highly educated, they are a hundred percent legal, they have the visa authorized by US government and they have welcome letters form their universities. If anyone thinks some people are taking away Americans` jobs, they should deal with illegals, not with OPT workers or students.

Key word 2. Not paying tax. OPT workers pay tax as all the US citizens do. They pay tax from the first second arriving in the U.S. They pay tax for education, for campus work, for internship and for full-time jobs.

Key word 3. Lower wage. Even with OPT workers, many STEM positions are still IN SHORT OF competent employees. Why OPT students accept lower wage for a position in shortage of people? No, they don't. Those who lowered the standard salary are not OPT workers since STEM people are still a seller`s market.

They are legal as you are. They pay tax as you do. They will ask for high wage as you will.

OPT expanding would do good for you, for us and for US!
