I strongly support this proposal and wish to see it passed. All of the foreign STEM students I've had the pleasure of meeting have been extremely bright, driven, and talented individuals. The one thing that unifies Americans as a population is our diversity. If you took a look only at my closest friends who are also American born, you will find people who's ancestors immigrated from many different countries: Palestine, Syria, Israel, Iraq, Iran, China, South Korea, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Bangaladesh, Canada, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, Mexico, and others. At a time when our European allies are opening their borders to people of all nationalities, skilled and unskilled, who are we to turn away bright, educated young people seeking a brighter future and to establish themselves in our great country?

While I understand many peoples concerns about American-born citizens losing out on jobs to immigrants, I don't believe this argument holds much water. The U.S is suffering from a huge job-talent mismatch. As of September 9th, 2015 there were over 5.8 million unfilled jobs in the tech industry. The honest truth is that these students aren't "stealing" jobs from anyone, they're simply filling a vacuum that has been left by our archaic and failing education system. Instead of directing our focus outward and attempting to prevent skilled, and productive labor from entering our economy, lets direct our focus inward instead and address the real issue: Why is that so many of our own citizens leave our academic institutions completely unprepared for the current job market?
