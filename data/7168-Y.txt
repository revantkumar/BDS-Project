Bokai Chen I strongly support the regulation of OPT extension. The reason is simply that most STEM projects take more than 2 years the cost of teammates transitions is very high.

I currently work in Research & Development vehicle health management (VHM) group for General Motors. I am working on 3 powertrain prognosis projects altogether. The average development cycle for each project is about 2.5 - 3 years, not alone the necessity of following up the production cycle of the projects. For one of my project, the former employee who worked on the project left due to the OPT duration limitation and failure of H1B visa lottery. It took me nearly 4-5 month to fully catch up with what he has accomplished and continue with what he leaves behind.

I am also working under OPT program which will be expired on April 2016. If my H1B visa lottery failed for the next April, due to the 17 month OPT extension withdrawn, I have to leave those ongoing projects behind and leave the country. It is reasonable expected that it would also take another half year for each of the project to be carried on by someone else. These kinds of delay would be a huge loss not only to the company but also to the customers who might could have avoided the accidents due to the failure of the powertrain problems. It could have been simply avoided by extending the foreign students' legal working period, a.k.a, OPT extension.
