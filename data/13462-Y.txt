Stem OPT should be extended for 24 months, supporting the students who really make huge difference in the development of united states is much important. Honestly speaking I don't find any reason why stem extension shouldn't be done.

I worked very hard for my studies and now its time for me to work happily in US, it is not at all fare to cancel stem extension and shatter my dreams.

I finally would like to say that STEM extension should be for 24 months.
