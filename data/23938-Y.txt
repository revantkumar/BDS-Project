Extending OPT for F-1 students does not conflict with providing more job opportunities for Americans. There are only a fixed amount of H1-B visas issued every year. If OPT is shortened, a significant amount of international students will lose interest in studying in the U.S. and contribute dollars to U.S. economies, and a lot of U.S. universities will be in financial burdens and domestic students will end up paying more for college.
