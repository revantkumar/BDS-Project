Xinpeng Du I highly support this rule.
I think the United States should provide more chances to those who get well trained in practical fields. Foreign people trained at high level education are beneficial to the United States as they are qualified to collaborate and solve tough issues in their own fields, which can increase the overall competitive power of the United States.

If those people are forced to leave, they won't contribute any more even they received and enjoyed good training resources and opportunities. That will be a big loss to the United states.
