I support the action because the action will provide the STEM students a way to apply our knowledge and contribute to the US high-tech companies.

Im a graduate student pursuing my PhD degree in the University of Texas at Austin. My research is kindly funded by my advisor and Intel Lab, through an university research program on the next generation of communication systems. 

During the past years, I gained knowledge in the field and did research in depth. I plan to devote myself to the research and join Intel if possible, to continue my research after graduation. The expanded training opportunity would give me more time to make solid contributions and I think thats a good way for the high-tech company to get more return from their investment in the research conducted in universities. 

I believe my experience is common among STEM students and that is why I comment to show my support to the action.
