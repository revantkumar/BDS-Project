I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension. I believe OPT-extension if NECESSARY for our country and will be helpful for the economy.

Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tremendous growth to the USA economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen. Without the contribution of foreign workers, I can foresee someday very soon when USA economy stagnates, especially in the tech industry. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.
