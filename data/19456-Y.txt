The Student Visa Program was originally intended to provide opportunities for people of foreign countries to receive technical educations at well accredited US Institutions and return home to their countries to be a benefactor in the industrial and technological development of their home countries. Public institutions have a moral and legal obligation to provide education to the citizens of the United States. Therefore, the needs of the citizenry of the United States come first and those needs are to be met before foreign nationals are allowed to take places at public educational institutions and employment opportunities located physically within the United States. The time period for OPT (Optional Practical Training) should not be extended to 36 months, it should be reduced back to the original 12 months.
