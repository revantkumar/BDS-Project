As far as I am concerned, the United States of America benefited a lot from high level international graduate students. They made their contributions academically and industrially. 
Let me list some outstanding representatives:
1)Pichai Sundararajan, India, CEO of Google.
2)Satya Nadella,India, CEO of Microsoft.
3)Franklin Yang,China, Winner of Nobel prize.
You have no idea what will happen to U.S. if they and many others like them cannot get a chance to stay. 
It is easy to close a door for them, but what will the result be? The united states could develop its economy without those talented? I really doubt that. It is also funny to worry about the average wage, since as far as i know their average salaries are among the highest.
