HENRY Wu I REALLY REALLY support this new rule Please note the talented foreign student can give this country more opportunities and mutil-culture! It can't be ignored that the contribution for the economy and society which come from these hard-working people. I believe the technical elite partly support to the development of this country in the past several decades. Please agree on this rule for tomorrow of U.S.A
