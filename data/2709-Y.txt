Yijia Wang OPT extension is not only beneficial for US economies in general, but also would benefit US citizens directly. First of all, a perfectly competitive market has been proved to be the basis of eocnomic prosperity, and with less restricted freedom to recruite employees, US employers could be greatly benefited from recruiting the best fit talents, thus contribute much more to the US economy - talents always come first place for business. Secondly, education was, is, and will always be the basis underlying all founding father's effort to build this country. Those foreigners come to US and study at US universities are the best catalysts for researches and development, and it's OPT programs to make it happen. STEM projects in academic world have a long history of international collaborations, and it is hard to believe that a country would give up all the benefits it would gain from all those achievements made by international collaborations. 3-year to 5-year is the reasonable length for academic researches, so does OPT extension. Thirdly, cancelling OPT extension would only bring drawbacks to US economy in the long term, the logic chain is very obvious - less foreigners would be willing to study in the US - less available talents for academic and commercial worlds (international academic collaboration, international companies) - less promising profits/achievements realized in the future - US becomes less competitive in this globalization era. It would be extremely shortsighted if the restrictions are put on foreigners, and the opportunity cost of cancelling STEM extension would be terrible not only for the US citizen, but also directly influence US citizens. While every countries right now embrace globalization, this proposed rule is an important signal from the US, and I believer that both the government and the people would make the right choice.
