I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

1. The demanding of STEM graduate student is undoubted, and international students are important group who contribute to both scientific research and industrial development. With the extension their accumulative experiences and contributions would not be interrupted. Also, the projects they serve to, always lasting for years, would not be influenced just for OPT length reason. If STEM extension is cancelled, more unnecessary cost would lay on human resource, maybe due to either frequent change of team members or not enough qualified domestic graduates relative to number of jobs.

2. Some may argue OPT students receive lower payment and would affect domestic student's competition ability. However, we would have to ask who was the one gets discriminated if it was true, and obviously it should be who got less paid. And the fact is there is no such phenomena because of e-verify program. The difference of payment mostly comes between internship and official job, not because of the visa.

3. If this proposal failed and previous 17-month policy expired, the impact to U.S. industry would be too large to tolerate. There is no point to push out highly-educated talents while every country is hoping to attract more.
