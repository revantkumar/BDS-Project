Madeleine Paterson You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. STEM graduates are creating more and more jobs for everyone. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. Based on the experience of last few decades, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields. They brought creative ideas, developed fancy softwares which are popular in the whole world and inspired US companies about how to do business across the entire world. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
