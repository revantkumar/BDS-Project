Tara Mackay The US needs more STEM workers to maintain its global competitiveness. As far as I have observed, I don't think the US can provide enough STEM at least at this moment.

Actually, many countries are trying to absorb more hi-tech employees around the world such as Canada, Australia, China, Singapore and Vietnam. I don't see any points for the US to be left behind.

Some people would argue foreigners have taken their jobs away. These people should not ignore an important point: the job market is not fixed, it is growing. The real problem is how to grow the job market instead of how to reallocate the existing positions.
