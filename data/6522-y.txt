Qi Liao Firstly, I strongly support the extension of OPT, because all these applicants are well educated and at least have Bachelor's degree. These people are creative and knowledgeable.They did a great contribution to America, such as the Nobel prize winner :Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Franklin Yang , Steve Chen(the co-founder of Youtube), and Ang Lee the most famous film director in the world.

Secondly, Who oppose the extension of OPT are really shortsighted. The technology is the most force driving American economic in recent two decades. If the American technology company wants go further, they must recruit more creative and well-educated employees to keep them more competitive in the future. So the extension of OPT is really necessary. Those opponents can not see the long-termed interests due to their bad educated background. They naively think that only if do they exclude these smart guys, they can take place these positions that belongs to the applicant. but the fact prove that no way, they do not the necessary background and the learning ability. 

Do not let bad money drive out good. Please remember the Gresham's law.
