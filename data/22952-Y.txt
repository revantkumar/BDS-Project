Some think that expanding training opportunities to foreign F-1 student would deprive American of employment, It seems straightforward because job positions are limited in number. But, this is actually narrow-minded, take trade for an example, everyone participating in trade is eventually better off. and, if you don't complain hairdresser take away your chance of cutting hair yourself, why should you complain foreign students have the chance of training? Most of those positions F-1 students take are not public funded and why companies are willing to take the trouble of hiring foreign student? simply because there is supply shortage of qualified talents and 'trade' is necessary. to my knowledge, low cost is not the top concern of the companies that hire F-1 students. 

Further, expanding training opportunities for F-1 students will benefits US at least in the following regards: 

First, to enhance the attractiveness of higher education in US, by providing more practical training. More attractive American education, more working opportunities will be created for American; 

Second, to strengthen the tie with other countries, emotionally and economically. Those foreign students who finish expanded training and return to their home countries will be better prepared and have bigger chance of succeeding in their careers. when time comes, US would be the first target country when they seek technical or economic cooperation oversea, which also create jobs for American. 

Therefore, not only F-1 student will benefit from the proposed rule of improving and expanding training opportunities, but, more importantly, American people will also benefit from the proposal.
