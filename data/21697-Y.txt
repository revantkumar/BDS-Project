On August 12, 1998 (and several times since), as the American Competitiveness Act (S. 1723) was quietly slipping through the Senate, I wrote letters of protest expressing my vehement opposition to that legislation. In that letter, which was completely disregard, I pointed out the fact that, among other things, the supposed shortage of high-tech workers was entirely contrived, and was primarily concocted to drive down wages.

Well, guess what...? My predictions have proven to be absolutely correct; that is exactly what has happened. High-tech job opportunities especially in the lower to middle pay ranges have dwindled. Concurrently and quite predictably prevailing wages have plummeted. My only error was in underestimating the enormities of those declines.

I know these things from firsthand knowledge, seeing them every day, because I have worked in the electronics industries, and I have been working in the computer and information technology fields. Very bright Microsoft Certified Systems Engineers, Certified Cisco Network Engineers, and other computer/networking professionals, some with numerous certifications and considerable experience, have worked alongside me for $11 to $12 per hour. Although there may be job openings being advertised in the Dallas area for various computer and help desk technicians and network engineers, even getting an interview is extremely difficult. Openings for electronics technicians (other than cell-phone technicians) are virtually nonexistent anymore.

To claim that there has ever been any shortage of high tech workers is not only patently false; it is utterly preposterous.
