I strongly support the improving and expanding STEM OPT rule. 
If international students major with STEM stay in US , they will make contribution for US companies, research institutes and good for US economy. Students with OPT also pay taxes, and they don't qualify for the benefits of US citizens. If this STEM OPT rule doesn't go through, there are at least 20,000 students worked at high-Tech companies have to leave. The suddenly shortage of high-tech employees will be a nightmare for high-tech companies.
