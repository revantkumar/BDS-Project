Sean Aubrey I just heard of this and I have to say something.

With the threat of terrorism attack and warning of ISIS, our lovely government will still keep accepting so-called refugees, who has been confirmed as a possible cover for terrorist in Paris's attack. Let us put their identities aside, why these people deserve good life while we have to fight for them? The news said they are all young men from 18 to 45. That's an army! They deserve good life in either Euro or America because their country is in war? How ridiculous it is!

On the contrary, we are stilling discuss about students's OPT program here. OPT has been proved to be a successful program which already kept and will keep help America's high-tech growing. The industry's fast expanding also introduce thousands of new job openings. Students, illegal immigrants, or dangerous refugee from ISIS? You give me the answer.

Vote for this one! we welcome talents and we do NOT need more refugees!
