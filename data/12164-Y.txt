I think I may be able to give some insight as to what has happened to companies like H. P. and Microsoft and the products
they produce, maybe it might be a direct result of employing such people as we are now writing about, as we all know, you 
always get what you pay for and what goes around comes around. I have bought three computers from H P and Microsoft, two from HP and one from Microsoft within the last four months, they have all been returned to these manufacturers due to
problems with hardware, software, and one had over sixty (60) viruses already active & running when delivered to my home.
Lastly, when contacting these companies there was no problem with returning these computers, it almost seemed like they were experts at the process, it all went so smoothly, of course I did have a hard time understanding the people helping me at customer service, they were in India. What are we going to do about these outrageous programs ? How are we going to
ensure that our children and grandchildren have jobs ? We can write all day to these people, call & fax till we are blue in the
face but there is only one sure way of ending these practices, stop buying the products they produce ! Organize large groups
of consumers to buy other products from other companies that do not use such programs, reward these companies with
large orders, it will work.
