Yes, I strongly support the extension of OPT for STEM majors because to start with, only the best of the best students from around the world are admitted to these majors. Most of these students have come with strong credentials and contribute to extraordinary research in all fields. It is always better to have them working for the United States rather than the opposite.

Also, these students add billions of dollars to the economy of the country and an extension of OPT would act as a sign of welcoming them to the United States. This is because when a student invests thousands of dollars, he or she expects to get an equivalent in return which is of course through a full time job to start with. But the process for an H1-B takes many years for some and an extension of OPT would give them their well deserved chances.

Hence I sincerely support the OPT extension.
