This has to STOP. We need to employ the citizens of the US FIRST. I do not have a problem with school visas to train students but they then need to go home and practice their skills. In that way they make their country better and do not take jobs from Americans. We are slowly becoming the country of the unemployed in which we do nothing and the guest student does it all. Please, Please, Please stop this.
