I strongly support the proposal for the following reason:

1: Those high trained worker with high education deserve a chance to work within in the US and they are really talent and supportive for the U.S company.

2: If the chance to work in US is protecting America People, why not just stop accepting international student for study. U.S benefit from the tuition, the spending, but in reverse, did not give a shot for job opportunities. 

3: It's already hard enough to find a job without citizenship, the employer already set a higher bar for international students, why take out the last hope. 

4:People are created equal, you can not blame losing job because other are working hard. there are only 50k stem students there, how many job opportunities?
