Sai Karan Kolanpyaka The proposed 24 month extension of the OPT rule is extremely beneficial to bridge the H1 B gap and Also it gives the international students a good chance to work in the field of study for a longer time without the pressure of getting a H1.The employers too benefit from this rule as they need not back off from hiring a certain person beacuse the persons future in the company depends on the H1 pick up.They can invest in him expecting him to stay atleast for 24 months extension period besides the usual 12 month OPT.
I absolutely vote for the rule to be implemented at the earliest.
