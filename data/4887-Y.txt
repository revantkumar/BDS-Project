I strongly support this rule. 

First of all, foreign talent students are willing and also demanded to practice their STEM skills in the industry and positively contribute to the US economy. The OPT extension makes it. If US does not open the gate to the talent F-1 student to apply their STEM knowledge and skills in the industry, it will be a great loss of the US but not the motherlands of these young talents. What's more, the international students may turn to more attractive countries with the similar opportunities provided. 

Second, the popular statement "foreign students are taking the jobs away from the Americans" does not make sense. In fact, there are a series of rules to limit the recruitment of foreign employees. Foreign employees are treated much more strictly than the Americans.

Last, even though there are F1 students using their OPT to work, it is more beneficial than harmful to the US economy. OPT is not an immigrant visa so the students will not "steal" the positions. However, if they work for other countries and contribute their talents, they may actually "steal", or say "take away", the positions because of the development of anywhere else but not the United States. This is a globalization age. If the US did not trust the US education quality and push away the great human resources, this rule can be abandoned and then we will see what happens. Many other countries will trust US education and be happy.
