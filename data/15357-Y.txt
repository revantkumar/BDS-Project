I strongly support the expanding training opportunities for F-1 students. 
One year is too short for a fresh graduate to be trained to a qualified engeneer or scientist.

And this OPT STEM is not taking any job opportunities from US residents. What we asked is only a chance to be trained after the hardworking in college.
