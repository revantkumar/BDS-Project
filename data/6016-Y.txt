Ray Froess Giving foreign students privileges over citizens is absurd. Expanding these privileges is even more absurd. I'm a retired engineer and our son is ready to graduate as an engineer. It is ridiculous that our government is making it harder for him to get a job and using my taxes against him.

My wife and I say NO to expanding the Optional Practical Training program - it should be abolished.
