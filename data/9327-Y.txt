I strongly vote for this proposal. This will not only improve the America's economy, increase the diversity of American community but also improve the education quality. Imagine it, if the proposal is approved, it will attract more international students come to American, they will bring a huge amount of money to local economy and the universities. The local government can use these money to improve public facilities and the universities can use this money to improve educational facilities which will in turn American students. Many of the international students are creative, they will bring a lot of new outcomes, some of them with high technological value, which will definitely power America up. I agree with this proposal.
