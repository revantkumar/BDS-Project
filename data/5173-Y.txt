I strongly support this regulation. I don't think people who posted negative comments here are using correct data here. They are saying that American's jobs are taken by immigrants but that's not the truth. All I see here in bay area is that we have hard time recruiting the right person. I believe even these immigrants are kicked out as they wished, they are not getting these jobs because they fail the criteria.
Without the best person being hired, I doubt if these high-tech companies can keep being world's first tier companies.
