I vote for improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students.
- Longer OPT period could help international students have great understanding with US tech companies. When the student comes back to homeland, international working experience would help him/her enhance the ties with US tech companies which could bring more business or collaborative "win-win" opportunities.
- F-1 students could create start-up companies during longer OPT period, which will bring more head count for working labors.
