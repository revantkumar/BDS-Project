Hi,

It's great news for an international STEM student, someone like me. 

I am Dhruv, a Master's graduate in Information Systems. I was spell bounded when I came to know that the 17 months STEM extension was absconded. It brought a lot of panic among the international STEM student community all along the US. As a STEM student, 12 months OPT period would never be sufficient as I can see, most of my friends take at least 3 months to find a job. That would be almost 25% of the provided OPT period been cut down for just finding a job, which would be disastrous for a person like who needs some time to clear my education loan taken for my Master's. 

The proposal for a 17 months extension brought a small relief for the international student community. It'd be much better if the 24 months OPT extension (as proposed in the document) would be approved, as it would help the STEM OPT community to learn and at the same time contribute to the employer we work for fruitfully and to the US economy considerably.

I request the concerned department to please consider the 24 months OPT extension as mentioned in the proposal for the benefit of the international STEM student community and US companies, which would in turn benefit the US economy.
