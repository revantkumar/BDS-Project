Shan Ji First, I agree with this plan. Maybe you have forgotten what makes USA so great : freedom and attraction. How many extraordinary people have moved to US because of the opportunity they can get here? Countless since the foundation of this country. But does this mean we allow every single foreigners come in and stay? No! We should keep illegal immigrants out of this country and fix our broken immigration system! However, Those students who got their degree in US and got hired by an US employee are extremely outstanding compared to peers in their mother country. So we are attracting the most brilliant and wonderful young adults to USA and make it better and better. 

Jobs are not taken away from anyone, instead they are created more and more because USA always having the most advanced technology and amazing companies! Especially in STEM area! If you complain about foreign students took away your job, that thing simply has never happened and will never happen in the future! Companies always need good employees. Being not good at what you do and keeping hardworking people out of the door is not the way it should be and it won't make USA competitive against other countries either. 

Please be visionary instead of shortsighted.
