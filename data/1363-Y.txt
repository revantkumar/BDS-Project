STEM extension should definitely be approved! United States is a nation that is known for its freedom. Hundreds and thousands of students go to US to have higher education and pursue their American dream. I saw that there are many so-called American citizens commenting that those students are bringing nothing but competition and will potentially harm the wellness of American citizens. I think it's all bullshit. Competition is everywhere. Don't naively think that you can avoid competition just by ruthless kicking them out of US. They will eventually come back to you with more power. I have taken classes, done project with many international students and I am even working with many of them right now. Most of them work in Tech industry and are working hard to embrace the next generation of disruptive technology. I thinking they are actually bringing more innovation than ever using the knowledge they learned from school. If US wants to rule the world, it needs the most talents and leading technology. And what those students can bring and change will affect the future of USA.
