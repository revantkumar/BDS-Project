I am a STEM student who just graduated in May this year. I sincerely feel that one year OPT is not enough for me to figuring out what I want to focus on my career. The first three years are really important to build a career. Therefore, STEM extension is really important. I have seen other people left the country because they hadn't got H1B before their OPT expired. They usually have only 1 or 2 years working experience before they left the country. It's hard for them to get a senior position with only 2 years working experience, so they have to start from entry-level when they go back to their home country. They have lost 2 valuable years in their career. It's cruel.
