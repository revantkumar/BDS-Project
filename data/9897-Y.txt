The reason for me come to US and pursue my M.S degree just because us provide a free and justice platform. I am not sure how long I will stay here and never think I will immigrate to here. I just enjoy the environment. If the OPT extension cannot be approved, I have to back, just because i have no legally status to stay here. That seems violate the feeling that US gives me. Also, I believe we, IT engineers, really contribute to the US.
