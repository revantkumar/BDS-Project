Longer STEM is definitely a right decision and will be critical for long term US technology development.

As one of the top skilled as well as talented graduates in computer science, I was offered a chance to contribute to a automated internet monitoring and engineering project. This a great innovation will significantly improve both the quality of internet services and reduce the maintenance cost.

Obviously, such a project cannot be finished within a year. So longer working permit will be crucial for the the project since many of the project members are talented F-1 nonimmigrants. Without STEM, many team members have to leave the team and it is definitely not easier to gather such a group of talented people. Everyone in my team is the most smart one I have ever seen in my life. Expelling such a treasure of United States is simply wrong!!
