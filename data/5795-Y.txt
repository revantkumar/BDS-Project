Vivian Su Strongly Support OPT Extension For F-1 Students

A lot of international students come to US and study here every year. Some of them are advised by famous researcher/professor in top universities. US need a lot of smart, young people to develop this country faster and faster. Knowledge, technology and talented people means power of a country in future. A lot of companies already agree with this opinion. So they try their best to hire talented people, no matter he/she is international or urban. 

Some people say that, they hire international students because of low pay. If there are two candidates, one is a person less talented asking for less pay, the other one is more talented and with more skills asking for more pay. The second one will get the opportunity. Only because he can make products much better and can contribute to the team more. Companies will earn more money and have a brighter future. Companies do not expect saving money on hiring less talented people, although they may ask for less pay.
