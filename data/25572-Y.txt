This regulation will definitely help companies in the US, especially IT firms to keep people they have already hired instead of having to lose talents because of a lottery. Hiring is painful, time consuming and kind of depending on "luck".

They will be familiar with both how the mother(main) company's culture works and also how things works in their motherland.
