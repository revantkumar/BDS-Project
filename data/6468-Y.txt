OPT doesn't deny American workers' jobs. If you possess the qualifications, you can get a job no matter there's OPT or there's not OPT; if you don't meet the qualifications, you cannot get the job regardless of OPT. US tech companies need to hire the best people who can deliver robust, high-qualify work regardless of their skin color or national origin. No one wants to drive a defective car developed by mediocre students. It appears that a number of jobs are taken, but in the long run, they make the industries stronger, which also creates jobs for Americans. 

Regarding your comment on international students being cheaper. This is not true at all. Do you know how much money, effort, and resources it takes an employer to sponsor visas and residency for international students? Compared to these costs, the medicare taxes,etc. are nothing. In fact, international students are more expensive to hire than their American counterparts. As a result, only the best get hired to contribute to America.

Regarding some people's quotes and comments that OPT is only a temporary training, after which international students should be let go. The reason bright people from the globe come to America to study is the American dream. They like the democracy and freedom that this country provides. In return, they work hard for this country that they love, making this country stronger. If we always kick out international students shortly after finishing school, then no one will come to the USA to study. They will go to some other countries, and make them stronger, more developed. If we don't want to see other countries rising as big powers, then we want to support OPT extension to retain the highly valued minds, and make America stay competitive in the world.

All the best to you,
