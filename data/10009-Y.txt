As a foreign student, OPT help me practice my technical skills. However, if I am only allowed to stay in US for only one year, my actual working hours are quite limited. First, I need a couple of month to get trained. Then, it takes time to form and maintain my professional relationship in my team. So overall, when I really get on boarding and start to contribute to my company, I have to leave... Usually a student with only one year's working experience is still a new graduate, not very competent, let alone making contribution or US economy. By the way, looking for a job also takes a long time...
As a stem student, we are not going to compete with native US citizen. Because we are high-tech employee and the number of available positions are far more than US citizens. Also, foreign students are good at engineering and cheap. Why don't you let us in to promote US economy ? Last but not least, I think the problem is not on OPT stem but rules to check OPT stem. A lot of illegal employee make use of the defects of OPT stem policy to stay here. That's the problem. For example, some company may just provide job offer but don't have real business. You should be more careful about this but not to cancel the OPT stem. 
Thanks
