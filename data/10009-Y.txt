Anna Henderson I strongly SUPPORT the proposal and this is definitely a good practice.

International Students in STEM disciplines, come to U.S to get into the Research and Development activities here. US has been the epicenter of many new technologies in the past and also in future. This diverse atmosphere helps nurture a strong workforce. I strongly believe that 24 months of extension would help students acquire more work experience besides contributing to US economy in terms of paying taxes and indirectly helping the economy by spending. It also puts employers at risk of being invested so much in students abilities only to be left with helpless situation and without substantial return on investment.

By extending it to 24 months, it benefits both companies and students alike. It gives the students the opportunity to acquire more knowledge and become a substantial contributors to US economy. Indirectly it helps in attracting the best talent from across the globe and if the OPT stem extension is cancelled, it could severely impact the talent pool that US has been successfully able to attract.
