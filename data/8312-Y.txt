Yil Xu I strongly recommend this proposal with some reasons:
1. Students who come to America to study and get degree are always very excellent person in their own countries. Without being in their home countries They have to face many problem alone and solve by themselves, So they are quite elites in many respects.
If they do not have enough chances to get more OPT times to work for America, surely the US will lost lots of elites and weaken the competitiveness of America.

2. Right now, in STEM fields, a lot of students who have got degrees are international students, if they leave the US immediately after their get degree, there are only few people in these fields can work for America, it will have big influence for many companies, and even damage the economy for America!

3.By history view, America is a country of immigrants, the reason why America is a big strong country is that this country has absorbed many elites from other countries. If now, US give up these policies to support absorb these elites, this country will become more and more conservative, and the competition will become worse and worse.
