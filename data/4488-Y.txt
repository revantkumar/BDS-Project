Ying Pan I vote for the OPT 24-month extension proposal. 
As a STEM graduate student who works in the company, most of the projects that I am currently involved in will last for more than two years. That means that 24-month comparing with 17 month or no extension period will enable us to complete our current project. We really appreciate the opportunity of working in the technology company and expand our knowledge to the real world industries. A complete project experience will make a good story. If we have to leave in between the project process, it will a big loss of both us and the companies who spend a lot of money and effort to hire us, train us and pay us.
