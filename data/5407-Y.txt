I support the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. The U.S. should let the international students majoring in a STEM subject stay longer in the country as this can continuously boost the technological and economic development of the U.S. The science and technology is the key to the further advancement of the U.S economy which benefits everyone of Americans. 

Some argue that those international students create intense competition for jobs in the U.S. However, the competion can push the majority of our citizens to enhance and increase their skills and can give our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. There is no guarantee how long it will take and how much it will cost to train all US students to fully compensate loss of foreign students. Without this policy, numerous companies in the United States will face serious shortage of STEM workers suddenly and tremendous loss.
