Chi Kung Agree so much. I strongly support the entension. Without the extension, the United State's economy will lag behind. America will not be the most powerful country in the world. These talents would go to other country if they can not stay in America. Without the extension, there are not so many STEM international talents pouring into America making contributions. So, I strongly agree with this law.

Kind Regards,
Chi Kung
