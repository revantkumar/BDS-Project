As an international student, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1.It is unjust and shortsighted to deprive international students legal right to work in U.S. after graduation. Because there are many international students in scientific and technology fields making huge contributions to USA. STEM are very important for the US to keep its leading position in the world. Therefore, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from US universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the US.
2.Diversity is a good thing for the US. Usually, international students from all over the world can work together better. With the global economy developing rapidly, many entrepreneurs need more and more talented new graduates from many other counties who can bring innovative ideas and skills to their companies. Thus, giving international students especially STEM the opportunities to work in US after their gradation is crucial to the development of US economy.
3.Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Admitted that every college graduate enters the job market to increase competition, but in the long term, competition can increases efficiency, accelerates development and benefits us all. Do not let irrational fear of competition ruin our true interest.
