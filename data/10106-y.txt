Richard Li STEM extension is a must because US right now is facing a STEM shortage. A lot of tech companies like Google and Microsoft are in need of STEM majors, but a lot of domestic students tend not to study STEM majors. As a result, there will be a shortage in STEM majors and it will really hurt US's economy and a lot of great US companies if the extension was cancelled. Most importantly, US is always a country that encourages fair competitions - this is the core idea of American dreams. Foreign students who study hard need to have the same opportunities as US students do. This is only going to make US a better country.
