I strongly support this new regulations. Why? Because IT comapnies will experience disasters if the extension is cancelled! A huge number of employees in IT companies are in F1 extension situation. If it is cancelled, who will pay for this? Who will pay for extra training and time? Who will pay for the tremendous loss of skillful and intelligent employees? Who will pay for the huge money loss for a company which will come along? Companies cannot take this scary risk. No CEOs will object this new regulation, instead they will absolutely support it!
