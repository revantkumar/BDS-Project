I highly support the new rule for OPT extension. First of all, the new rule can help to present America to the whole world. The new OPT extension rule is more attractive to foreigner students. With more foreigner students come to America, more people in the world will truly understand what a great and powerful country America is. Secondly, the new rule can help America to be more competitive. With all these excellent people work for America, I am sure this country will be the strongest country in the world. Furthermore, the new rule represents American's thought of diversity. Students from all over the world come to America to share their thought which makes America a better place for sharing, studying and working. And from another point of view, after we study here for couple of years, we enjoy the benefit of the school and the society, after we graduate we want to do something for the society as return. The best way is to use the knowledge and skill we learned from here to contribute to America. And this rule give us a better chance to do our contribution. In a word, I strongly support this new rule for OPT extension.
