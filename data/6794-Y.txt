I do not agree with the (OPT) program. I believe in helping people, but lets first help the American families first, then help people from other countries. Folks we have homeless, and people who are starving, right here in our American back yard. We need to help them first. Why aren't there incentives for employers to help give a job to a homeless person? The more homeless people we help, the less that are starving and on the streets. But back to the (OPT) program, lets look at the pros and cons of this shall we? Pros, helps the students coming into the country doing the internship, also helps the employers getting the internship break on the tax payroll. Cons, Takes away jobs some Americans already have, not to mention the jobs waiting for the students just finishing up college in those areas. Those are being taken away from our own people. Next, Social Security is going to suffer greatly because of the payroll tax break these employers are getting for doing this...So UNFAIR to those folks that really need that money that they have paid into Social Security all their lives. I bet Mr. President Obama didn't think of that. That could be one of his own children coming out of college and being shoved out of the job they were promised and worked so hard for just because he didn't think of the consequences and the impact it would have on this country, or even his own children, not to mention many thousands of other students just finishing up college that their parents paid for or they themselves paid for. What a waste. NO, I definitely do not agree with the (OPT) program.
