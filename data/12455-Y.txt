Dear Officer,
I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I was a student and be graduated on 12-2014, my major is electric and computer engineer. Now I am use my F1-OPT to work for a American company. As we all know, our major need experience and difficult to skillful a technology. Just one year time is not enough, actual, book in the label and work in real life is total different. Meanwhile, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely

Rachel Zhang
