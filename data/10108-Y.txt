Yes, finally! This is such a wise propose to benefit the research institution. As a leading researcher of a major corporation, I had the experience of working with a lot of talented foreign researchers who held F1 with OPT. But there has been several times when my director had to delay the project because of the termination of employment of the F1 students since they ran out of OPT time. It's such a pity for us to lose such talented and hardworking researchers simply because they were kicked out of this country by the rule made by the government of 'The land of freedom'. And we had to put so much un-meaningful effort and money to search for replacements. I have already been in 2 projects which some foreign researchers or engineers who played key role had to leave because of the end of their OPT period and not able to get an H1B visa. Both of these projects ended up being delayed because we had to find capable replacements. And millions more dollars were lost because of the delay. The new rule will definitely improve our research process, since a typical research project has a life cycle of 30 to 36 month. If they cannot stay longer, they have enough time to at least finish one project. Although I think simply changing the OPT rule cannot fully fix this dilemma that we had, it's at least a good first step of saving a lot of the research groups from being trapped into this situation.
