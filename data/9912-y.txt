Emily Wang STEW students are very beneficial to U.S: 
1) More than half High-tech companies were setup by High-tech immigrants. They are our future job-providers! They definitely will CREATE MORE JOBS, not compete with US citizens!
2) They DO NOT ask for any benefits: Medic aid, Medicare, Food stamp etc...
3) Their jobs are definitely non-replaceable by US citizens. Those jobs demand lots of complicated Math, Computer Science and Engineer background. The fact is: Only around 10% graduate students in our university are US citizens and Lots of IT companies Needs More than the whole department's!
4) STEM students have been living in U.S for at least 2 years, and they contribute to the community by Paying Expensive tuition, consume product and Pay rents. They have very high potential to be future US citizens to serve more to U.S.
5) They do not need public educational resource( k to high school), are ready to take high-level tech job, and PAY TAX!
6) The ILLEGAL-immigrants WITHOUT STEM degree in US are the major competitor with most of U.S. citizens. They take any low-tech, low-skill work with lower pay, not those STEM students!
7) Some foreign workers WITHOUT STEM DEGREES in U.S. abuse the H1-B visa rules and they grab the U.S.jobs directly out of the airplane WITHOUT any contribution to U.S.

So, The OPT extension for STEM students URGENTlY needs to be confirmed and Expanded! To further improve U.S's strength, the GREEN CARD APPLICATION should be expedited to STEM holders!
Otherwise, they will go back to the home country during the 4-5 years waiting to serve the competitor of U.S.!
