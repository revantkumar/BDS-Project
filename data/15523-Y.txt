OPT is important for US national interest. Years and years top international students came to states for studying STEM of which many were on scholarship (yes that US investment already). We don't want our investment wasted by letting world's most talented people leave US. It will be a blow to US obviously if they are to work for our competitors. Many of you who have the rhetoric of it's job loss to citizens are abviously not working in US tech companies where hiring is already a serious problem. For the sake of US national interest we need to give even more favoritism to OPT and other STEM policy, not the other direction.
