I strongly support the proposed rule. As an international graduate student majoring in one of the STEM majors at Princeton University, I hope I can speak on behalf of international students in the US. At Princeton, ~40% of the graduate students are international students from more than 100 countries. This is also true for many other top US universities. These students are very gifted in their own fields and they have the potential to contribute greatly to the US's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness. However, if the US government makes it so difficult for them to stay, they will go back and contribute to the prosperity of their own country. In addition, many governments have implemented certain programs to attract the best brains home. If the US government does not do anything to retain the best brains trained in the US, it is almost certain that US will lose its leading role in the world in the long run. 

The proposed rule is a smart move by the government. It provides a simple way to retain the best brains at minimal cost to the country. It is argued in many previous comments that the proposed rule will make it harder for US citizens to find STEM-related jobs. I totally understand the concerns of those people but I encourage the decision-makers to think beyond that. We live in the 21st century and our lifestyle is changing everyday by new technologies. It you loose the brains who invent these new technologies, you loose the future.
