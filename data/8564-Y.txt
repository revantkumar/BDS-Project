For Internationals like me, we are not taking the jobs away from Americans. For this OPT time extension, which enables us to work in America for a longer time, it helps the American society a lot by creating a tremendous amount of financial profit. Internationals with their amazing skills has help the US a lot of keeping on the top of the world, even the CEO of Google is an Indian immigrant now. If Internationals are abandoned from getting this extension and the amount of H1B visa is still this limited, all of the current working internationals need to go back to their countries immediately. Imagine companies like Intel, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Airbnb, Microsoft, etc, companies that change people's life, loosing staffs like this, how terrible will it be when this happens? Every project will be stopped. You will not be able to get any amazing update on your phone, your TV or everyday life as fast as it is today. Your pace of living will be slowed down to a point that can't be compared to the other countries. Support this regulation if you still want the US to be the top country in the world!
