Sincerely to whom it may concern,

Those students who took the advanced educations in the US are very important recourses from my perspective. Especially the student majors within the so called STEM regions. As an engineer I deeply know how urgent the high tech company need intelligent engineers, mathematicians and special analysts now a days. The limited US citizens will be far from enough for such a large highly intelligent job mark US has created. Without saying most of the science and engineering students are internationals.

Meanwhile, I totally do not accept sayings like immigrants took away jobs from Americans. Individuals can be fool not the entire country. Advance degree takers, regardless of nationality, will always taken high end and handy jobs. A lot of high end positions, will the company really willing to spend more money to support an unrelated international student than directly pick up a citizen? The answer is a hard NO. Then why international student still finding very high end jobs? Cause they got something really important. I'm not saying there are no qualified US citizens for the same position. We all know that US is leading the high tech, financial and producing industry. We have tons of high end job openings. The question is will we really be able to select 100,000 talents from US citizens to feed 100,000 companies around Silicon Valley?

Also, American is a immigrant country that respect knowledge and specialties. If we continue placing obstacles for highly educated international brains who are willing to contribute and create values with their intelligence, are we really doing the right things to support our development?

In short, the country cannot be hijacked by small group of fool individuals. The country need truly knowledgable and talented person regardless of their nationalities. Therefore I completely support STEM extension proposal. Thanks.

Regards,
