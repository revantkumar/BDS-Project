Erik Stephens I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion will hurt American workers not help them. American jobs should be the first priority in any legislation. We need jobs for our own citizens and veterans. The Optional Practical Training program is simply a big business loophole that simply amounts to corporate welfare. Foreign workers can be hired for up to 3 years in certain fields and not pay any payroll taxes! Our American citizens should not have to compete with another pool of foreign tech workers, it is already hard enough for college graduates to find jobs now. Immigration policies and legislation should always put American workers first and foremost in this country. I am against any expansion of the Optional Practical Training program.
