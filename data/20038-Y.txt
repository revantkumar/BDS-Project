US is a great melting pot where different people get to make contributions based on their strengths. This is also why many people love US and want to work in this great atmosphere. The fact we want to want to work here makes great contribution to the economy and the society. So let's keep this going. Providing opportunities to talented people who can make changes, not limiting their opportunities by the law. And BTW, for foreigners who can find jobs, they can make a difference in this country. US certainly don't want to lose these great people. Most of our home countries are making great effort to convince us to go back. If US doesn't want us to stay, we choose other places to make contributions.
