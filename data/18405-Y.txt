I strongly support this extension. I am a Chinese student majoring in Geo-engineering. I know that most of the research projects in our field founded by national science foundation (NSF) is more than two years. If somebody leave in the middle of the way, it takes a lot of time to train the new people. That will highly affect the research progresses and achievements. It won't make the most use of the funding or we could say it is a waste of funding. Thus, the extension of OPT is necessary. 
Also, I believe that most of the international students choose US as a study-broad country with paying the expensive tuitions is because we'd like to have some working experience after we graduate. That will help the economy in the US as well. The OPT extension is the important reason why STEM major students choose here. Otherwise, why don't we go study broad in other countries like UK, Japan or Germany. 
We will eventually go back to our home country. But the OPT extension let us make most contributions to the country we studied in and be more competitive after we go back. Taxes from the OPT jobs help the economies. Also, with OPT extension, we have more time to learn about the markets of US in our field. That would help the cooperations of the field between US and China after we go back and make the most benefits for both sides. Therefore, I highly support the OPT-extension to be approved!
