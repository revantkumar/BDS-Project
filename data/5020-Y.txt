John Mata I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Here are the reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities make contributions to the U.S. The government / universities invest a lot of education resources on those international students, but after they graduate, we don't have the polices to keep them stay and pay back. It's a big loss for U.S.. 

2. OPT-extension keeps international students stay here legally and they have to pay the tax at the same time. 

3. Think about the top tech companies, like google, apple....They hired a lot of international engineers. I believe they prefer to us-citizens, but it's not enough for their development. If we send those high talent international tech students back to their countries, we will lose the advantage at the high-tech areas in the future. As a result, we will lost more job opportunities.
