I strongly approve to expanding the OPT time for F-1 students. Reasons are:

(1)F1 students have no more chance to get a job than local people with the same degree. Those jobs if not taken by F1 students, then have to let those local people have less skills to take. This is bad for the development of company. 

(2) For those local people who cannot find the job, they need to understand more competition means stronger they could be. If everyone improve their skills rather than just complain for no job, American will never improve.Government should see the long run of competition rather than the short run of no job. Look at China, there are billions people's competition, that's why China catch up so quickly.

(3) If students can not find internship with in 12 month after graduation, they have to go. This make studying in American less attraction. This is because classes we can taken online or from book, but working experience in strongest country makes students completely different. Those students without working experience went back to China did not welcome more than local students graduated from China. If less time of OPT, means less chance of working experience, also means less attraction to study in American.
