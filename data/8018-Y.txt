Elizabeth Van Staaveren This proposed rule is a recipe for disaster to the US citizens who are or wish to become STEM workers. It should NOT go forward. It should be discarded NOW. Not only does it hurt this group of workers, it hurts the entire U.S. citizenry and the economic well-being of our country. It also endangers the security of this country, as immigrants are not being adequately screened, and too many of them have helped the enemies of this country. Immigration rules are supposed to serve the best interests of citizens, not the best interests of international corporations and certainly not the best interests of enemies of the U.S.

You should read the reports of John Miano who has studied the H-1B visa program intensively in recent years. See his reports listed here: http://cis.org/Miano-Publications

The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.

Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.

OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.

Because OPT workers are technically students, employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.

OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.

OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.

There is no shortage of qualified STEM workers in the U.S. If that were true, wages for such workers would be accelerating rapidly. Theyre not; wages for STEM workers have been flat for years. The same cannot be said for revenues for big tech employers. Those have been growing rapidly in recent years.
