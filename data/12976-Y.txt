I totally agree with this proposal.

As the IT industry booms, there is huge demand for IT workers in U.S. As I see it, the number of workers in demand far outnumbers the number of domestic IT workers. This is the problem we have to face.

So in order to solve this problem, this proposal provides us with a good solution. Students of STEM need chances to practice their skill, which can largely benefit companies of America. Currently, OPT doesn't provide enough chances for STEM students to work in America; and this proposal will help make up for the that 'fault'.
