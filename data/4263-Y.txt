Wen Zhang I want to say those jobs are not be forced to be given to foreigners. There are visa requirements: only jobs that can not find Americans workers are assigned to foreigners. If you shut down this program, there will be no benefits to Americans. Those companies can not find right workers may get some trouble or even shutdown. In this situation think about Americans worked for this company. They would lost their jobs. On the other hand, if we let those foreigners in. In the future those foreigners who get opportunities may create more jobs for Americans, such as help company grow and then create more jobs or they may start their new companies. Thus we should promote this program.
