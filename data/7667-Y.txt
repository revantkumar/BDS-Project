Dan Lee I strongly support this proposed rule. I think this is a great move as the foreign STEM students already compete with others to study in this country. They are smart and will certainly bring a lot of skill and value to the US economy. Companies would not be able to continue doing cutting edge research and innovation without more foreign students.
