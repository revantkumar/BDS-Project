Xingyu Hu The fields that OPT extension involves are the area where cost the people who devote to it much more time and enthusiasm than other fields.To speak frankly,they are "hard" area.And as far as I know,the main reason that why the locals refuse to make the period extended is that they're afraid their job opportunities can be less.But as we all know, competition makes a group more standout.It's a positive competition.To say it in another way, if a participant is afraid that his competitors are very strong then he burns all the application forms of his competitors.Sure that he can win the champion.But does the champion mean anything?? A good participant would never be afraid of his competitors.That's what a positive competition about.
