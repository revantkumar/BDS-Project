Part III

(4. The OPT program runs contrary to the purpose of non-immigrant student visas.)

A longer OPT period is viewed as a means to give more chances to apply for an H-1B visa that in turn allows applying for immigrant status. This is reflected in the comments made by many aliens in support of this regulation. E.g., ICEB-2015-0002-0962 ("12 months are usually not enough to successfully apply for a H1B VISA. Therefore, the extensions are extremely important."), ICEB-2015-0002-1384 ("I am supporting for OPT extension to 24 months for STEM. It will help us to our next step of getting H1B Visa. Currently H1B is going through lottery and it is really difficult and un-predictable that we will get through in one attempt."), ICEB-2015-0002-0824 ("I completely support STEM extension 17 months or more(24 months) because this will allow students to get job & apply h1b 2 times during that extension period."), ICEB-2015-0002-2636 ("It is a very good rule. Can increase the total chance of the international students getting a H1B visa."), ICEB-2015-0002-3698 ("A lot people will be able to get another chance to win the H1B lottery and get to stay in US for a longer time!"), ICEB-2015-0002-2870 ("The longer STEM students are allowed to stay in America, the more opportunities they have to obtain the H1-B visa and remain in America, working at American companies helping them grow and succeed."), ICEB-2015-0002-4007 ("If new rule extends opt-extension to 24 months, international students have much more chances to try H1B lottery."), ICEB-2015-0002-0811, ICEB-2015-0002-0590, ICEB-2015-0002-1466, ICEB-2015-0002-1467, ICEB-2015-0002-0366, ICEB-2015-0002-0592, ICEB-2015-0002-1089, ICEB-2015-0002-1188, ICEB-2015-0002-5546. Clearly, many aliens are coming to United States on student visas with the intent to remain permanently, in violation of the terms of their visa. This proposed rule aids such aliens in their unlawful purposes.

The volume of such comments showing that aliens come to
