Absolutely cool policy and I definitely support STEM OPT extension. This will provide the students to get exposed to the real world working culture and will help them gain real time knowledge, thus making our university programs much more prestigious and attractive. I really could not understand those silly people who are against this nice practice. They can never know how much money Americans education will lose without this STEM OPT extension. Besides, some problems in IT can be solved with the wide availability of these well-educated and fresh graduates. The Billion dollar industries has more advantage with this and this will give the real meaning to the land of opportunities.
