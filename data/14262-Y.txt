I think this is a good initiative and Americans as well as international students will benefit from this. If this is approved, america will attract more students to study in USA. Income from foreign students is a big plus to any country. This will also help in research and development.
Also this will improve the quality of work in stem jobs due to tough competition.
If there is a chance for international students to stay longer, then there is also a good chance that these people would setup startups and create more jobs.
Creating restrictions in the field of technology will not help in the progress of a nation, where excellence is first priority.
Thanks,
