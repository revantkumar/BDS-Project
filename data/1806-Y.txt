I strongly support the new proposal to extend the OPT. It is the spirit of this free land to give every people the equal right to live, to have a job to support a living. Just call back the first generation of your family, if your ancestors were deprived of the right to have a job, what a miserable would be your family. The same thing goes for us now. So be open minded. It maybe true, because of us, the job market becomes more competitive. But on the other hand, this will be another motivation for natives to study harder, work harder, explore your potential, improve yourself. Isn't that a good thing to become a better yourself?
