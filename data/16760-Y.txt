I strongly support this new rule. As the trend of the previous years shows, skilled immigrants have made huge contributions in the innovation and ground breaking research. With this comes more jobs and opportunities. It is my firm belief that immigrants need to be given the time and benefit of the superior technology in America to help build the foundation for a culturally diverse, fundamentally strong economy that will help everyone live better lives. With a 24 month extension on the OPT , the skilled workforce has enough motivation and time to create something that could potentially change the world.
Also, on my personal perspective, I'm a new graduate and very willing to contribute my knowledge and skills to help my employer. I do need this extension to help myself get a better chance to get a h1b visa in order to continuously work for my employer. I have two MORE chances to get a h1b visa. And I get two MORE chances to stay and help making contributions to both my company and United State.
