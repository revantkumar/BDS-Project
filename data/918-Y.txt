I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to work in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out.

International students are making huge contributions to USA. In 2011, Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world and produced more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010. Most international students work in scientific and technology fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to ace at in order to continue its leadership in the world. 

All the STEM workers contribute a lot to federal and state, and even more when they can get H1B. The contribution can be used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people.
