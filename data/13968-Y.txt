In my opinion, I support the OPT extension rules for F-1 STEM students. It is good for universities. 

To non-immigrant students, They have to pay over a thousand dollars for a credit, which means the U.S. universities get around $10,000 that can be used for better education each semester from an international students. And, having good policies for F-1 non-immigrant students is a factor influencing them when they choose a country to study. If the F-1 students do not have better opportunities in the U.S. comparing to other countries in the future, they will consider to study abroad in other countries that are requiring lower tuition fees and providing better living environments and chances to non-immigrant students, for example, Singapore. 

Now, F-1 non-immigrant students, especially the masters, they are willing to pay such high tuition fees for the U.S. universities is because of the personal development opportunities after graduation in the U.S. They have the chance to work for the U.S. companies for achieving their career goals and chasing their dreams. 

If the OPT rules are changed, they will not want to waste one or two years in a country that they cannot see their successes in the near future.
