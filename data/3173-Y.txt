Cdr. and Mrs. David Cuttino We oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. We, being over fifty years old, have been unable to find suitable full time employment for two years. If we continue to give jobs to foreign workers our young and older American citizens will suffer.
