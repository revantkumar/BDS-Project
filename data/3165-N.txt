From 2009 to 2015, OPT has granted 497,274 work authorizations to F-1 visa students. 
Please explain how this has benefited American-born students who have graduated from the same colleges, hold the same degrees, and have the same qualifications as the F-1 visa students.

Through the OPT program, employers are not required to pay F-1 visa workers the standard prevailing American wages. In fact, their wages are significantly lower that those of American-born hires.
Please explain how this benefits the wages of all American-born workers.

Both the F-1 visa workers and their employers are exempt from payroll taxes, which has contributed to the loss of billions of dollars from our social security and medicare trust funds.
Please explain how this positively contributes to the solvency of these vital programs for elderly Americans which are rapidly becoming insolvent.
