I strongly agree with the proposal. First of all, the requirements of the entrance of college for international students are much higher than the native ones. As a results, the international students tend to have a better performance during the studying. In the industry, there are a lot of jobs that demand large quality of professional people with STEM background. If an American is capable of one job, no one will recruit international student due to the complicated visa problem. However, large quantity of international students have been recruit in the US now, which demonstrate that the international students are required for such job and can not be replaced by the American people. If this is the case, by kicking out the international students who failed to get THE LOTTERY H1B, may cause a huge lose to the US. The international students are not the ones who take job opportunity from american people. They are someone to fix the problem that american people can not do. So we should open our arm and welcome them to stay as long as possible if only we need them to do their job.
