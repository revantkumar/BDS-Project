I strongly support this proposal because it injects energy to American companies. As we all know many American technology companies thrive because of the high-quality work force. I have seen that some opposing comments are just asking for privileges with absolutely no logic. Driving the high-quality specialists away will do no good to these people, it will only suffocate the America technology development.
Maybe some people should learn to improve themselves instead of driving other people away.
