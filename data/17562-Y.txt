I support OPT extension for STEM program students, they are important to U.S. development, my friend is hired by U.S. company now and she is going to apply for STEM extension, if extension is canceled, she has to come back to her country, then what about the loss of the company? The training, development are all not benefit for U.S. economy anymore, so please support the extension, for the benefit of U.S. citizons.
