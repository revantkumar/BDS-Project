Harikrishnan Janakiraman Dear Thomas Hayden,

I am not sure what situation provoked you like this and blaming entire Indian Graduates in US. You have to understand first, American Top Companies like Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Pepsi are all running under Indian born CEO's who graduated over here and there are N numbers who contributed to Silicon Valley. We paid back to US much more than we received. If you get a chance, I would personally advice you go and interview each CEO's of big MNC and ask them about our work ethics. Then you will come to know who we are. But don't say we faked our exams, faked resume, faked the job. If this all true, then why Top Companies still hire lot of Indian Graduates. And also , I can see that, you said we can't even speak proper English. But I like to clarify this, no university in US will select a candidate unless until he/she cleared TOEFL/IELTS English Exam. Please check the statistics , Indian population tops in speaking English than any other Asian Countries.

Overall, Please don't underestimate the talent of Indian Graduates in US.
