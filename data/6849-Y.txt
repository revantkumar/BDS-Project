Extending STEM F1 visa regulations is absolutely necessary to make the US competitive in the high tech areas. There is in fact no proof that foreign STEM graduates lowers the overall wages for anyone. However, STEM job opportunities are abundant enough that companies are in great need of skilled graduates. The fact that many of them are unable to renew their contract with foreign employees simply because the employee missed out on a lottery makes it very hard not for companies to make hiring decisions discriminatively. This could ultimately only hurt this great country in its unique innovative capacities and cultural diversity.
