Jason Yin I strongly support the proposal, talented foreign students coming to America will definitely stimulate the economy. In the long run, they will actually create more working opportunities because many start up companies need talented workers to expand their influence. Foreign talents help strengthen the power of these companies and bigger companies bring more working opportunities. Moreover, not all workers will stay in the U.S. forever, many of them will go back once they gained enough experience. 
Almost all Americans are actually immigrants themselves, expect you are native Americans. Historically, old immigrants typically excluded new immigrants but history proves the crucial role talented new immigrants have played. America now is the biggest economy on Earth. Surely, foreign talents now will also bring prosperity to America.
