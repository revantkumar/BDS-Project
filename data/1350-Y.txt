The proposed rule effectively serves to understand the needs of International students in the United States. I fully support the extension of the OPT (STEM) from 12+17 months to 12+24 months. Tens of thousands of talented young students graduate every year and OPT gives them the opportunity to apply their technical / scientific skills learnt from school at work, which undoubtedly is a huge boost not only to the country's economy, but also contributes significantly to the advancements in the fields of science and technology. Extension of OPT provides adequate time and experience to these graduates to decide on their future career. 

The proposed rule regulates the OPT process as it lays strict rules to ensure only deserving candidates are eligible and that OPT candidates are treated on par with American candidates in terms of eligibility criteria, job requirements, wages, benefits etc. Thereby, it also invalidates the arguments that OPT takes away a chunk of jobs in the country and is the reason for cheap labor. Overall, the proposed rule is the first step towards regularization of work force / immigration in this country.
