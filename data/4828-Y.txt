I strongly support the STEM extension program. Our country has long been benefiting from its diversity culture and the spirit that every one who make their effort should have the equal opportunity to succeed, the STEM extension program has helped a lot of talented students stay in this country, making contribution, building career, bringing good influence to other people, if such thing gets paused, not only will it affect the large amount of talented students who are working in the U.S. giant high tech companies and startups right now, but it also sends an inappropriate signal to those students who are planning to pursue their degrees here in the future.
