I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.
(1) It is required 3 years OPT to train a qualified STEM worker.

It provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after school 
training. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college
graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist (compared with the 3-5 years 
residency period of medical school graduates).

(2) U.S. will suffer from tremendous financial loss by revoking old STEM OPT
rule and failing to publish new one. 
(3) STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident. H1B 
does. Don't blame at the wrong thing.
