I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

Day after day American Citizens are replaced by foreigners in our labor force. We have seen how Toys-R.Us, Starbucks, Harley Davidson, Pfizer and Disneyland, with the assistance of DHS, treat American Citizens forcing them to train their replacements prior to being let go. Is this how our government, whose very jobs are dependent upon American's votes and subsequent taxpayer salaries (for the people, by the people and of the people) treat their fellow citizens?

It was my understanding that the Department of Homeland Security was created for national security to keep America's citizens safe from harm by foreign entities. It has morphed into a corrupt despot working against national security promoting the demographic and cultural demise of America and for all foreign immigrants. It is time to stop this anti-American invasion promoted by this administration through the DHS and crony corporations.
