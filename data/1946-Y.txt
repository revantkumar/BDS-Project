Tejas Moola I support this extension.

The STEM extension allows students to become surefooted and transform themselves into contributors of economic growth of USA. It will give them enough time to make informed decisions, such that they are not rushing into employment with the first opportunity they get. It gives chance for a deliberation and also future changes needed in employment, before they lock themselves up with one H1B employer.
