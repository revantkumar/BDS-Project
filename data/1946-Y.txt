As an owner of a company hiring international students, I would support the extension and expanding of OPT rule. We hire them because we believe they qualify the position. And the truth is yes, most of them are doing a great job or even a better job than we expect. We provide comprehensive training to them as we do to native employees. And of course we hope that they will work for us as long as possible. If the extension is gone; they will have to leave the company one year after starting their work. This is unfair to them and to the company. It's a waste of time for both of us. In this case, I would imagine, fewer and fewer students will consider US as their first choice for studying abroad and the US will lose a lot of intelligent and hard-working people. This would be a very bad news for my company, as well as a lot of other companies in our country.
