I'm really pleased to see this new policy wrt OPT extension is finally rolling out and I firmly believe this new policy will benefit the US as well as many highly-skilled international students. My PhD adviser at the US university, as well as many of my close American friends, have expressed unequivocally that it is a great waste of money for the US university to train these talented international students and drive them away by setting high barriers in the immigration legal process. What stupid policy! Just look at how the international students in STEM areas are contributing to the economy here! Is there a single US high-tech company that is not benefiting from the talent pool comprised of international STEM students? Not a single one. The US government should definitely take steps to sort out the legal procedures to allow more international students stay after their diploma and I by all means support this new policy!
