The new extension of Optional Practical Training program is undoubtedly beneficial to US economics. Considering the limited number of H1b visa provided each year, and relatively high risk of failing in the H1b lottery, STEM companies will be significantly discouraged to hire any foreign students who are newly graduated. However, the fact that how fast H1b visas are running out each year can easily tell us that there are huge need for foreign employee in those fields such as IT, statistics, chemical engineering, etc. 

Assume there is a IT company A, each year needs to hire 5 new data scientist, which is a position requiring much math, statistics and CS algorithm knowledge. Because there are strict standard for foreign labor to apply H1b visa, technically already protecting the Priority for a similarly qualified US person to get hired in ahead of a foreign person. As a result, company A hire 2 US worker on average each year, and due to the fact that not many US students are willing to throw themselves into math and statistics graduate study, this company A has to hire 3 more foreign workers each year too.

Each newly hired worker needs about 6 months to really get trained enough to become a productive efficient worker. Under the old OPT extension policy, which allows foreign people to work in US for more than two years before being able to get their H1b, everything goes well for company A and the 3 foreign workers: the 3 foreign workers, even with bad luck not being able to obtain their H1b permit at last, can work in company A for about two years as proficient worker after the 6 months training.

Once the OPT extension gets cancelled, it will be immediately put company A in an embarrassing dilemma: if they keep hiring 3 foreign worker each year, they put themselves in a huge risk that those workers may only be able to work for 3 or 4 months after get well trained to be proficient, and have to leave US because the one-year OPT is expired.
