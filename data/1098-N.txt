I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. companies to hire non USA students up to 3 years and avoid paying their payroll taxes, equal to 7.65% of employee's pay. This program creates an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, and also could violates the foreign student's pledge with their F-1 visa to leave the country after getting their degree. Recent college graduates are struggling to find work. This is not the time to provide an incentive to hire foreign folks instead of U.S. graduates and citizens. Got it ??
