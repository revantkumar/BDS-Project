I am a first year student at University of Virginia. Though not finalized yet, I am going to major in mechanical engineering in the near future. STEM extension has a prominent effect on my career here. I have chosen to study in United States partly because of the policy gives talented international students more chance to practice their skills after their graduation. It thus provides US employers more talented foreign employees in all fields related, which is good for US economy in all respect. It do creates competition with US citizens, but this competition is necessary. It also promotes US education system with more people attracted by this policy to come to here to attend school.
