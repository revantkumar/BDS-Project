Extending OPT like that is a bad idea, it is already hard for citizen kids with computer science degrees to get jobs in their field. As the Government again and again gives jobs to foreign workers, who sometimes go to school here no more then 1 year. 
H1b's and OPT employers, or employees do not need to pay SS or medicare taxes, fix that first. Don't say they are not entitled to it as your reason. We all know that current citizens Grads have little chance of collect anything either, it's nothing but a pyramid scheme, we all know it.
Fix this loophole first, making them cheaper is not fair. Also demand that they get paid median or above for their salary. If employers don't want to do that, they are not really "needed' THEY ARE JUST CHEAPER. 
Thanks you for your attention to this matter. It is deeply concerning to me.
