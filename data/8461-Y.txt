The spirit of liberty make people can share their idea to everybody in this country. And this inspires many engineer and scientists and also makes US stand in the top of world's technology field.
The opt extension offers an opportunity for students in STEM majors a chance to keep innovating their idea and make their ideas come true. Silicon Valley, a place which is changing the world every day. Many countries want to duplicate this city, want to become world's technology center. They may have money to build the infrastructures and provide best equipments. But they can not find these engineers, experts and genius! 
The spirit of Liberty and also the culture we built in the last 200 years is the way we attracting students to stay in US and contribute their life to this place.
While if the immigration law is the reason that we can not let them stay here and lose them, we may need to fix this. Laws should corresponding to the spirit of America and also be good for this country in the future.
New OPT extension will be good for us to attract STEM students and help us maintain the leadership in the world technology field. This is also the way corresponding to our history and culture.
