Expanding this war on American workers is completely unacceptable.It also makes little sense:
1.OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
2.OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.
3.The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.
But the administration is already well aware of these facts. 
What do I tell my son, a recent STEM graduate who has to work at a restaurant because there are no jobs FOR HIM in his field?
Or my daughter and other son who are starting college in STEM fields? Should they give up or change majors because they are less valued than (cheaper) foreign workers?
Looking forward to your answers.

Sincerely,
Americans
