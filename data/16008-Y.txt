I strongly support OPT-extension, it is beneficial to government, companies as well as international students.

Firstly, many international students rely on OPT and OPT-extension to work. Most students are in positions of Information Technology.They make contributions to US economy much. Many software engineers earn much and the tax they paid a year is more than 40 thousand dollars. Besides the tax they paid, they also increases job opportunities for other Americans. For example, once it is told that one people hired by Microsoft will bring 6 job opportunities. If OPT-extension is cancelled, which means many high-tech positions will lose their employees, which will affect government income and job opportunities.

Secondly, companies needs international students to create value for their company. Many giant companies like Google, create much job opportunities and pays much to government. If international students can't work in those companies, it will affect those company much and affect US economy as well.

Thirdly, OPT-extension is for STEM students. It is not true that the international students is competing with Americans in job opportunities. For example, the Software Company is willing to hire Americans but many Americans are not willing to work in Software Companies or it is hard to find Americans that is suitable for the position. So Software Companies can't hire the right American or can't hire enough engineers to support their business. That is why they want to hire many international students. Besides, the OPT-extension is for excellent students around the world who studies in America. If the government fails to let them work for America, they may have to go back to other countries and work for them. It is not wise that government can bother to see the loss of many talents and excellent people.

So OPT-extension is necessary and it is good for excellent students, companies and governments.I strongly support it.
