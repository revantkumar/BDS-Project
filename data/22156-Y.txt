This is NOT a program that places foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market competition or the education competition. The foreign talents have NO privilege over any US citizens. Please be aware of that, foreign talents have made a huge contribution to this country, and this is a STEM extension, the america is in need of these talents to help the country the develop the high tech technology and the economy, this is important. If an american born person is working hard, it will be much much much more easier for he/she to find a suitable job than any other foreigners. This is the truth.
