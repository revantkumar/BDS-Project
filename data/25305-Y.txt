I strongly support this rule.
MIT has thousands of International students, and let alone other top schools like Berkeley or Harvard. I am certainly sure these are the people you want to keep. Now the short OPT makes only 50% chance for the MIT guys to stay since it does not see a distinction between a highly sought after PhD from MIT and a IT worker probably with a bachelor degree from a small school. The real thing that the Intl students wouldn't come to the US to study will result in that much of loss in money to the US govt...(they must know how much US earns through the Intl students)
The government promises stem opt for 29 months and now breaks the promise, it is a bad thing to do. With all due respect to your sentiments.
