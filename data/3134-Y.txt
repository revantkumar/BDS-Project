Tim Booth I TOTALLY SUPPORT the OPT extension and got some solid reasons: 
1, the Opt extension is a main factor that will attract international student to come to USA to continue their education. If we don't have this kind of law, they may choose to go to Europe. 
2, if they choose another country, they will spend money in other country which will stimulate the local economy but not USA's. 
3, if they choose another country, USA will lose the chance to attract the most talented people from the world and this SUCK! 
4, if USA cannot get enough smart people to back the technology growth, the competitiv power of USA will be lost. 

I own a IT company and I know this best. Please, people, think of it in a more long-running perspective, think of why USA is still the strongest country in the world, because we got TALENTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD!
