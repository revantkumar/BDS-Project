This new OPT extension rule is quite a good win-win rule for both US and oversea students for the following reasons:
(1) The fundamental STEM education of US turns out to be a failure, while there are a lot of talented oversea students who are very good at STEM, and it would be really hard for a lot of tech companies who want to hire the high-tech engineers if this rule could not passed.
(2) I know a lot of nice and talented oversea students and they are really easy to get along with. This rule could make these student stay in US and improve the diversity of US.
