I support extending the training period for foreign students. 

A group of highly talented, skilled engineers is essentially the core competitiveness of any high tech industry. It is also the core competitiveness of this country. Extension of the OPT program, at least, provide an opportunity to these companies hire top foreign STEM students for certain period of time. These companies will benefit from it, economy and this nation will benefit from it in the long run. 

Termination of the OPT program artificially constrained the ability of those Hi-tech companies to hire the right person. It is detrimental that they will have to fill in position based on citizenship and immigration status, but without considering of the person's skills and capability.
