I support the OPT extension proposal based on the following reasons:
1. United States is an immigrant country, a complete legal immigrant system is vital for the prosperity of the united states. H1B is overall a good incentive to attract educated immigrants all over the world to study, work and live in the united states, which essentially bring cultural diversity and make intellectual contribution to the states. The prosperity of the united states is built on advances in sciences and technologies, and an extension on OPT for STEM international students will prepare people with the needed capacity for the continuing boost on sciences and technologies.

2. There is no evidence showing that current OPT and H1B immigrant system the cause of unemployment of Americans. Therefore, those blame on OPT extension for unemployment has no solid base. On the contrary, the boost of economy, either by innovation or manufacture is the key for lowering the unemployment rate. On the long run, making a complete system to embrace the STEM student is consistent with the benefit of the US and all americans.
