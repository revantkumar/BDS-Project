I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many international students bring new idea and new culture to this country, which made this country become more and more diversity.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Most international students apply the high-tech positions, which need high degree student and many specialists. Most international students have such high-tech backgrounds and master or even high degree.
