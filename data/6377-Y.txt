Hi officer,

My family and I are homeonwers and we have several houses in Los Angeles. Tell you the truth, 90% of my tenants are international students from different countries and they attend graduate school at a nearby university but most of domestic students do not need to rent a house.

In a matter of fact, not only my family but also a lot of different families, we earned a great benefits from those international students. We start our business from one small house and current we have already have 8 houses and our business keep growing. I can not imagine that once we canceled the OPT extension program, our top universities may not that attractive to international students and of course, me and a lot of families same with us will lose their business. 

Actually, not just me, all my family members really enjoy living with the students, they brought different cultures and stories. 

I on behalf of my family will give the strongest support for the OPT extension policy!
