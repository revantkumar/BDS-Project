With student debt at an all time high it is unconscionable that an American student is not afforded every opportunity for employment but instead the government is subsidizing their competition. With companies making record profits, it defies all logic that they receive any subsidies or tax breaks. In the case of F-1 hires not required to pay Social Security taxes or their employers have to make matching contributions, that is a 15% pay difference. At a time when Social Security and Medicare are both financially insolvent and premiums are being increased for mandatory insurance for Seniors, this is a slap in the face to them as well. To be fair, if the F-1 is relieved of Social Security, income taxes or mandatory insurance, so too should the American citizen. Or conversely, the F-1 should pay if the American citizen has to pay. This would remove all financial considerations and allow competition on intellectual ability. The F-1 has already received a substantial gift from the American taxpayer because tuition and fees alone don't cover the total cost of operating a university.
