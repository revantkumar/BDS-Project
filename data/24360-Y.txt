I definitely support this proposal for the following reasons.

First, why United state of America can be so strong?I think no one will doubt that its diversity and inclusiveness play a crucial role. The past history already prove that. Those students are skilled and smart people who can make contribution to the development of USA. 

Second, I think we can improve the criterion of hiring in order to recruit high tech employee instead of forcing those people who already show their ability and make contribution to leave.Actually in fact, the those complainer already have a natural edge 

Last but not the least, the competition generate the productivity and the pressure produce the inspiration. This can push the majority of our citizens to sharp their skills and work harder,which will give the companies more choices to choose and get the true talented resource.
