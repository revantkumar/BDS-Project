I totally don't understand why some people want to keep foreign talents out of the United States. This country was great because it attracted top level talents from all around the world. Look at the Nobel prize winner in US, most of them are immigrants. Look at the founder of top companies in Silicon Valley that make US still the leader in this era, they are from all around the world.

Think about it, if US closes the door to these talents because of stupid narrow nationalism, think about what this country will be like in the near future. Yes, maybe some people say that if we kick all these immigrants out of US, it will be easier for us to find a job in STEM area. Don't be silly, the fact is that local US people are not good at STEM majors, that's why we need talents all around the world. 

The only result of closing the door is that all the great companies will disappear in the near future, the next Google, the next Facebook will not in US, they will be in India, in China, in Russia. Silicon Valley is the last redemption of the current United States besides our aircraft carrier and wall street. Don't ruin it, embrace it!!
