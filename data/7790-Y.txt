jing guo I strongly support the new ruling about OPT extension. 

1. OPT program is directly related to US educational institutions and is fundamentally a selling point of the US educational market. A lot of people come to the US rather than go to other countries because of this benefit. If the extension was canceled, then it would be a threat to the US educational institutions financially. No one would ever want to bring CASH to the country anymore in exchange of education. The extension, to some degree, is a basic sales strategy that has worked well. 

2. US higher education has been long short of enough students to do research. If the attractiveness of US education went down because of the cancellation of the extension, then the US research and high tech would be the first victim. US will lose its biggest advantage over other countries and will eventually lose its power. 

3. People cannot equate OPT with the general immigration problem. OPT is very restrictive - only granted to those who have studied in a US institution. It is not even immigration. It is funny that US allows a lot of illegal immigrants to come to this country for free but does not give qualified people who are anxious in creating value for the United States to stay. 

In summary, I think OPT extension is a benefit for exactly the US universities, companies, economy and even for each individual.
