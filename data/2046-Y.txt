As a STEM student currently working full-time on OPT, this new rule could potentially change my career in the positive direction. 

A longer OPT means I would be able to work for my current employer longer. I would not have to worry about my future before going into the third year, which would to a great extent help me maintain high productivity and a peaceful mindset at work. My employers would be more willing to assign me longer and more important projects because they would know for sure I could stay in the company for at least three years. 

If the 65,000 H-1B quota did not change in the next few years, extending STEM OPT from 17 months to 24 months would literally give me one more chance to draw the "lottery". It would also give me an extra year to make plans for the future, such as preparing for graduate school application, in case I missed the first two draws. 

The third party of interest is the prospective foreign students who are looking forward to coming to the U.S. to study. Longer STEM OPT extension would be able to attract more students to study STEM subjects. Personally, the main reason I chose a STEM major over a non-STEM major four years ago was because I could have a longer OPT with a STEM degree. Without that incentive, the students who have to make the same decision would likely choose non-STEM majors unless they have strong interests in those intrinsically more difficult subjects. Consequently, the technology industries are likely to be short of highly-skilled foreign students in the future. 

In summary, this new rule is a well-thought move by DHS. It would benefit both STEM students and their employers, and the biggest beneficiary at the end would of course be the US economy.
