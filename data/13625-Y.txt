I support this proposal because it can bring benefits to both Americans and F1 students. Students who have knowledge on STEM majors can work in the US if they want. They can make contribution to the US society by working in relevant fields. America becomes more attractive to more talent students, so it does not need to worry about the lack of experts on STEM majors.
