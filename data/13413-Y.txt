I support this idea, because STE, are so essential to the US. International students who study STEM are the best students in their home country and work better than local students. They are talented, creative and very hard-working. We have spoiled our kids to be lazy. We should encourage our kid to compete with international students in stead of protecting them. If we protect them, they will lose in the future.
