I would strong support this proposal for the following reasons.

The proposal pretty much important to the future of the country since programs in STEM usually takes quite a huge rule in technology and information science, which indicates how strong the country would be in the future. This rule would help a lot for the country to be stronger.

Some people are just arguing for the competition in finding a job. They say, it would add "un-necessary job competition". But companies are recruiting people without their race, gender, only just with talent they want. Under this situation, if companies lose students in STEM program, they will not have enough talent to continue their work. This would lead to two results: either, those talents will raise up companies outside of the US, which would largely impact those top companies, like Google, Facebook and decrease the US technology; or the US companies would build their campuses outside of the country and hire those students to continue their leadership, and in this way, people who used to have the opportunity to get those work in US now lose them entirely.

Also, It's odd to see some comments stating that STEM students get low wage or they would take job not related to their program. In fact, almost all the students get their opt and then move to the H1b stage which requires a certain level of individual income, around 3 times the minimum pay in US. And the H1b also requires a student to have his/her job closely related to his/her program. Most of the STEM students are perfectly qualified for these conditions.

It's American's spirit to give all its people equality and this rules is just one of the symbol of the equality to foreign students.
