I am an F-1 student; and I am pursuing my Master's in Software Engineering at San Jose State University. With great efforts and spending a huge amount of money, our parents have send us to US to study, and gain a good amount of practical approach in US, as US is considered as the IT Hub. I believe we should be given the opportunity to showcase the skills we garnered during our 2 years Master's course, this would not only help us but the companies too. If STEM rule is not extended, then people will stop coming to US for their higher studies, and I daresay, US will loose their tittle as 'IT Hub'. Please do extend the OPT period, and let us help each other.
