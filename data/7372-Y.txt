I am an international student who will benefit from this policy. The United States also gains a lot from it. This is not a zero-sum game, but a chance to benefit both sides. So I strongly support this policy.

First, it can "better ensure the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally". When I am plaining to start my master program, I have several choices: Japan, England, Denmark, Australia, China, and America. The reason I chose the U.S. is because the original OPT which enable me to gain near 2 years working experience before I back to my homeland. This experience can strengthen my competitiveness. Most international STEM students came to U.S. because of it. And no doubt the new policy can attract more talents to study in this country.

Second, many us companies trying to build their own business in other countries. This requires their employers have both marketing experience in the other country and experience on how American company works. Residents in America can gain such experiences from international students, and international students can gain such experiences from U.S. companies. This will create more working opportunities for both sides along with the expanding of U.S. companies into the new market. 

Third, we pay for tuition and afford living expenses in order to learn new stuffs in the U.S.. This means that we bring money from our hometown and create working opportunities for residents in America. For example, I am now in Los Angeles. Every semester, large mount of international students need to rent house. So there are many company such as CDI Management, G.H. Palmer Associates provide service to us. If U.S.A. cancel OPT, it will dramatically reduce the international student number. Which will cause 2 issues: 1) it reduces the working opportunity for residents. 2) it may cause the failure of existing company and many employees lose their jobs.
