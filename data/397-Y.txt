Kate Barnett I do not agree with the Optional Practice Training being expanded. 
Why is the U.S. prioritizing providing jobs to foreign graduates instead of jobs to U.S. citizens? Because
employers are not required to hire foreign STEM workers at the prevailing wage, and the foreign STEM
workers are exempt from payroll taxes. So the STEM workers take jobs away from U.S. graduates, and
the employers save money.
Foreign students need to return to their home country immediately after graduation.
