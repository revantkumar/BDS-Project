As a foreign student in U.S. , I fully support this regulation. 
Some comments say that the foreign students tend to immigrate to U.S. after they work here. I do not think this is a reason why this regulation should not be approved. U.S. is a country with high diversity. Native is only 1.4% based on Wiki. In other words, almost no one is originally from this land. Multicultural and immigration make U.S. what it is now. U.S. is benefited by immigrations in many ways. It is not right to stop this regulation because of the foreigners tend to immigrate. Even some people think government should limit immigration population, this regulation can help to ensures the quality of immigrations. The fields mentioned in this regulation are the most technical and high request fields. Students who work in these field must be high qualified to get graduate. High qualified employees will benefit the firm and the country, of course. 
Some comments say foreigners "steal" their jobs. The high salary jobs should leave to U.S. citizens. In fact, high qualified foreigners can make U.S. citizens more competitive instead of "steal" their job. Competitive environment is a good environment to improve ourselves. In other hand, if their is no one to compete with, human will be more and more lazier. 
Giving the opportunity a person should have is one of the most important spirit in US. The STEM fields mentioned in this regulation have low percentage of U.S. students. But positions are not less. US need these high qualified foreign students to do the jobs. A high qualified U.S. citizen should have the job. So is a high qualified foreigner. It is not a right reason to reject a person can do the job due to where he is from.
