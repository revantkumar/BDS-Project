Kevin White I support the proposed rule.
I think compare to STEM students using OPT, H1B workers from India outsourcing companies are more likely to steal jobs from US citizens, most of the H1B visa are issued to them, they directly come from India, some of them even don't have a degree, the salary they get are only slight above the required $60000, which is much lower than a normal worker should earn in IT and software industry. See the following article from New York Times
