I strongly support the new OPT rule. Below is my reason.

First, the intern opportunity after finishing a degree is the most important reason for all the international students to go to the US universities.

Second, all the international students have paid their tuition, living fees, and also any kinds of tax. The international students have strongly improved the economy all over the US. 

Third, the people and companies in the US need international students, who are creative, smart, and able to do their contribution to create a better future. The US is a open country, which is willing to accept the talents from all over the world. This is why the US has been the most greatest country in the world for over 100 years. 

At last, I stand with the new OPT rule!
