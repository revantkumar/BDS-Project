Career training is a crucial part of education in general. For STEM students, this is especially important because their degrees are not centered on career developing. The majority of their time at school is devoted to solving very academic and scientific problems. International STEM students need an expanded time to cross the gap between their study at school and their future role in a society.

On the other hand, native people don't lose anything. The STEM students can create a safe environment and a vibrant community. They are well-educated and well-behaved people. Allowing them a longer stay in this country really doesn't hurt anybody at all.
