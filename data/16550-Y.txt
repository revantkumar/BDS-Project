I think the extension is really important for students who want to push for progress in STEM fields while working in the US. It's pretty common for students to spend semesters working at US companies while pursuing undergraduate degrees, so it's easy to use up the 12 months of initially allotted OPT. With the lottery system for H1B visas, there would undoubtedly be newly graduated students who can significantly contribute to the industry, but won't be able to due to running out of work authorization time. It seems counterproductive to give people the opportunity to begin playing a role in the nation's scientific development, then shipping them off to other countries with a lot of fresh experience and knowledge.

People using up 12 months of OPT are generally productive and driven employees, so it could only serve to hinder advancement by refusing their requests to keep talent in the USA.
