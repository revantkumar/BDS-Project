I strongly support OPT STEM extension for international students!!

1. Many international students came to the states with tuitions paid more than local citizens, we deserve the chance to gain working experience before we head back to our country.

2. When foreign student got a job in the US, it is not because we are foreigner a US citizen, it is always about our ability. Do not use "OPT extension allows foreign workers a advantage above USA citizens" as an excuse to take away our reasonable rights! 

3. Please take actions toward those companies that abuse OPT and H1B.
