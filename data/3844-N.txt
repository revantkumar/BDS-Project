This ruling only further exemplifies this administration's contempt for American workers and creates a defacto expanded H1B program, while granting corporate subsidies without Congressional authority at the expense of the American taxpayer. This ruling has nothing to do with "training" and everything to do with depressing wages and cheap labor. American workers and our veterans should be first in getting these STEM jobs, and our federal government should be working actively to make sure they do rather than making sure corporations get the cheap labor they desire while robbing American's Social Security system in the process. The only people who don't win in this situation, are American taxpayers.
