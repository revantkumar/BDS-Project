In the passed several decades, thousands of foreign students spent their youth as well as wealth to get educated in the U.S. Everyone among these students holds a faith for his own American dream(s) and some of them has already made it come into true, which can be easily proved throughout the country. And in return, the American society, including industry and educational institutions, benefits greatly from their dedicated work. These international talents have already well demonstrated their contribution to the country and the prospective innovation that they can bring up to the nation.Without Opt and extension, and with H1B being monopolized by limited companies (such as Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and HCL, Deloitte and Accenture), many well educated international students will loose their chance and faith to realize their American dream(s). Consequently, it will ruin and suffer the American education, industry and economy in long term.
