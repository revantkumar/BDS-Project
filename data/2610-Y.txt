I strongly support the extension of OPT. 

The United States sees a large influx of international students every year. Undoubtedly there are some who have bad reputations and did not make any contributions to the US. However, I still believe that the college selection system selects a large amount of talented and capable students every year, especially in STEM fields. These students are the best in their own country and yet they choose to come to the US. As a country who values talents regardless of background, shouldn't the US give these students an opportunity to work and make contributions to the US? The extension of OPT will allow them to work longer here as a way to repay the excellent education that they received here.

Some Americans are worried that these STEM students will take their opportunities away. But that is not true! Many of them are in positions where few Americans want to take, such as computer programmer. An economy needs a mix of talents to thrive, so isn't it a good thing that the foreign talents complements the talent pool in the US.

In short, I strongly support the extension of OPT!
