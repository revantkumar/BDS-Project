I think most of the famous scientists are not born in the Unite States in last century, those people made great contribution to the economy to America, as well as WW II. Maybe some people think that F-1 students take away their opportunity, but what their opportunity will be without the contribution of previous immigrants?

I don't think US government is lack of consideration about future, and one of the most important key to the future is keeping STEM students. Think about Germany, they attracted a lot of international students but didn't offer visa after they got their degrees and most of them came to USA, now you can clearly see what happened. 

So please do the right things. Any decision you made will inevitably injure the benefits of some people, so think about the future.
