Chuchuan Hong I think expanding training opportunity for STEM f1 student is so necessary! Not only because they can provide much intellegence and knowledge to inprovement of STEM related region in America, but they study in America for several years and have familiar with culture and lifes in America so they can do their work better. And to be honest, many f1 students can do better than some natives because they are not in their homecountry and they will do their best to prevent themselves fired. Pls improve and expand OPT for f1 students! It will be so beneficial to the USA!
