In my opinion students with advanced degree deserves to get enough opportunity to stay in the US and apply their skills and knowledge acquired studying in the world'd best educations institutions in US. The OPT extension should be approved and students should be given at least 17-20 months to attempt h1 visa. I think this step will be help US to improve the economy further and lead in the technological arena.
