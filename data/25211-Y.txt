I am in support of the proposed STEM change from 17 months to 24 months. This will help international students gain experience in their field and use and apply the knowledge and skills they learned in school. We spend a lot of money studying in this country and the experience we get here will help us land a good job even if we decide to go back. This will also give us three chances to apply for H1B, which will probably allow the talent in this country to stay in this country.
