I am an international student doing my master textile degree in the North Carolina State University.We have the dream to work at here and contribute the society. 
I believe that the extension is very useful and necessary. Those negative comments are wrong, and super weird. Without the extension, most of the international students would go back, and there will have large impacts on the economies of America.
Thanks. Please.
