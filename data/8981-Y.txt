Rachel Xu I think this is a good policy both for the students, and for the US government. The STEM students has received great training from the universities, and have the ability to make the US economy prosper. The IT companies, financial institutes will benefit a lot through this policy. It's always good to have the best talent in the world at US company, leading all the innovations and great creativity in the industry. 

This policy won't do any bad to the domestic workers and students because with the prosper of the high-tech industry, more and more job openings will be created, and the employers will continue to improve working environment and salary in order to keep the best talents. This will also broaden the opportunities for US students as well. The key point here is to keep the smart minds in the US, and support the development of the US.
