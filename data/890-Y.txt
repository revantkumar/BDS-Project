Neha Rana Extending OPT period would be a right step and big relief to thousands of international students and their families, who wanted to study in the world's best universities and make a career for themselves here, which is equally profitable for their employers. A lot of employed people who did not just get lucky with H1B visa lottery system and are working on STEM extension, would have to leave immediately with no fault of theirs. To think of it, if the original rule was not annulled in the first place, these people would still be working and it would have nothing to do with what anti-OPT people are saying. It is being used as an "opportunity" by some to spread vitriolic opinion. I have faith in the system that a right decision will be taken soon.
