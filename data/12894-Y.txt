Depriving the chance of international students to work in the United States is very shortsighted and against American's interest. International students are making huge contributions to our country. From the programmers in Facebook, Google, Microsoft to engineers in Apple, Tesla,etc, after graduating, international students in these companies have been participating in creating countless fantastic apps, websites, softwares and hardwares that directly benefit American's daily life. Some outstanding students are even creating jobs for Americans by starting their own business in this land. According to the Partnership For A New American Economy, immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 millions workers around the world in 2011 and created for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010. If US rejects these students, they have to go back to their own countries or go to other countries to seek a job or start a business, and that is definitely a giant loss for America's economy.
