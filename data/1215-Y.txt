I'm a Chinese mother of a 17-year-old son. My son decided to study abroad and majors in Math and Electrical Engineering. We choose couple universities both in the UK and the US. The US universities are more attractive to us, not only because it has a better education system but it also gives international students more opportunities to get practical training after graduation. Practical training is extraordinary important for students to apply what they learn from school with the actual industry. Compared to other countries, the US colleges are no longer attractive without the OPT extension. 

On the other side, the US government and taxpayers expand a large amount of money on the college education annually. It doesn't make sense to lose those well educated young people, let them to make contributions to the competitors and other countries. 

As a potential US-college parent, I fully support this OPT extension and CapGap relief proposal. I'm looking forward to seeing this rule get effective and my son can study in the US college and benefit from this rule.
