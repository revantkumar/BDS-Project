I SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:
1) Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many famous people, such as many successful entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, are international students before they succeed.
2) Competition is not a bad thing. It will help employers find more qualified candidates for some positions which there are very limited number of American candidates. It will help to improve the average competence in STEP fields. Furthermore, it will improve the competitiveness of the U.S. in the world.
3) It is important to let the brilliant brains to make contribution to the U.S. after they graduate.
