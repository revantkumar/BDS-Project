Benett Lindauer According to international education experts, and practitioners like myself, U.S. universities in particular and our nation in general benefit from having international students in three ways: (1) revenue, (2) exposure of U.S. students to other points of view, and (3) sharing our culture with international students. I believe that is in our national interest to give these students the opportunity to put into practice what they have learned and contribute to our economy and expertise.
