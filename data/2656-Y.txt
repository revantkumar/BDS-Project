As an international student, I strongly support the OPT extension program. To be honest, OPT program is part of the reason why I choose US higher level education over the other counterparts like England and Germany. If there is no OPT, US education will not no longer be as attractive to international students as before. Meanwhile, 12 month OPT is not sufficient for international students to gain enough experience themselves. Generally speaking, after 12 month training, most of fresh graduates are still an entry level employer. If they go back to their country at this point, this 12 month work experience in US is too short to be polish their resume, which makes US education itself less competitive to them. Without OPT, all the education institutions will lose a lot of international students, which will result in a decrease in revenue, in the end, less support their teaching and research work. 

Secondly, by attracting and training international students, US have a chance to select the best possible workforce and keep them to work for the American business. As we all know that although all international students are offered the chance to receive training here, not all of them can find a job at the end. Those who actually utilize the OPT program have to be competitive enough to gain the job opportunity, which means that American companies have a better chance than companies in the other countries to select the best talent. Maintaining a top-tire workforce is such critical to the development of a country economy, which is not possible without the OPT program. If there is no OPT program, American companies will lose their competitive advantage, which in the end will hurt the benefits of US citizen.

Also, I need to say, international student is not CHEAP labor!!! Our skill level deserves the company paying generously for us.
