I strongly support this policy. The global economy is at its lowest level, so is the American economy. The best way to attract talented people is to show the government's confidence and faith. It's absolutely beneficial for the US to adopt this policy in order to attract more talented foreigners in STEM disciplines. Competition is equal and just, no one is trying to steal jobs from Americans.
