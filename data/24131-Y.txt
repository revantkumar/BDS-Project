I think the government should improve and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students. Students with STEM degrees has made and will continue to make great contribution to the America. Obviously, the America is lacking great amount of people with advanced knowledge in STEM areas. Also, I don't think the opportunities for local residents will be affected. The local residents are always given priorities in seeking jobs.
