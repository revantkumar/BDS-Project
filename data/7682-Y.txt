It will be a great loss to the country of depriving international students' legal right to work in the country. I firmly believe by allowing international students to work in the state will prosper the the country's economy by creating more job opportunities and raise the whole country's salary level. In contrast, rejecting them to work for the country will not raise the country's salary lever, but also will not create more jobs for the citizens.

Most international students will choose to work in the science and technology industry on their specializations (myself included), it is those international genius we attracted from China and India who had great education backgrounds and exceptional skills and innovations raised the power of the United State of America in areas including informational technology, entrepreneurship and scientific researches.

Varies reports reflected the fact that international students work on their specializations benefited our country. According to the report by the Partnership for a New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf), immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010. These benefits of employing international students are facts that is noticeable in our daily lives, not just stories made up to convince us.

It is reasonable to think because of international students' participation in the industries will increase the competition of getting a better job - it is likely to be harder to be employed by tech giants like Google and Facebook. However, it is because of the strong competition, we are able to employ specialists with a much higher standard who achieve much more and benefits the economy much greater. Not only that, in longer term, much more job opportunities created by stronger international talents in the industry who start next tech giants
