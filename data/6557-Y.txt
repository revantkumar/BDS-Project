I oppose expanding training opportunities for nonimmigrant students with stem degrees. Then what, they go home and compete for our jobs and business using the education and training they got from us. Enough! 

I support better support of STEM BS degree students to stay in school and get advanced degrees so they can once again be the predominate faculty in colleges and junior colleges.
