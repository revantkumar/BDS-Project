As a software engineer in silicon valley, I should say I really enjoy working with international students and they are real talents, if the OPT is cancelled, I will see a lot of them leaving my country which is very very very bad for my company and team, and super super super bad for IT industry from my perspective of view. Keep the new rule please. We need them.
