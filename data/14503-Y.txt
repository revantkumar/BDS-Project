I think OPT extension is a great motive to enhace the economics of the states. The number of international students is growing throughout the years. Most of them want to stay at America but it is not always the case. Even if they know they may leave at the end, they still want to apply for OPT and stay here. If they stay, they need houses, cars and exerything that keep they alive. This is good to the United States' economics. If they stay one more year, they spend more money. But we still use lottery to decide who is going to have H1B. So the total number of H1B will stay the same.
