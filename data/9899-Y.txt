I support the new OPT proposal from the view of USA government.
1) USA has an intrinsic culture of internationalization. Cancelling OPT extension will start to impact this negatively, as there will be much fewer fresh bloods coming in.

2) Students of STEM are to supplement what USA lack, not to over-compete what USA already has. This is truly benefiting the economy.

3) Cancelling OPT extension will also impact many companies immediately which rely on these labor force heavily, like big IT company.
