Zhishi Jia We are talking about OPT extension for F-1 students, so let's talk about how that will benefit America.

Some people are saying this will steal American people's jobs, I think it's the opposite: this will improve the job market and economy. The initial purpose for STEM OPT includes providing more skilled people for manpower demand in STEM fields, has this demand changed? I do not think so. Actually this demand will increase by 14%-62% by 2020.

So if the OPT extension can satisfy or help with the STEM manpower demand and improve American economy, I do not see why not expanding it.
