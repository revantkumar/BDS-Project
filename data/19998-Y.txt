I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. There are estimated several thousands or even more F1 students who are currently on OPT-extension. They are in companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Oracle, etc. If OPT is stopped, tech companies have no choice to do but to layoff thousands of employees, which would absolutely hurt the tech industry of America, as well as its economy.

2. I am an international student at NYU. Before I came to US. I have several choices to go for graduate school. But finally I chose US. One of the reasons is because of longer work experience . I believe lots of students are like me and they came to US for the same reason. If opt gets suspended, a huge amount of international students wouldn't come to US for education. It is also a negative impact on the American Universities.

3. STEM fields has been lack of talents for a long time. The reason for DHS to make OPT-extension is exactly that there are not enough Americans who are great at, or interested in STEM. That is to say, OPT wouldn't have an impact on the opportunities of Americans. We are just to get a work experience where there is a shortage of work force, not to compete with Americans where there are already an fierce competition and not enough vacancy.
