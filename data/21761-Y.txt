I would like to provide the perspective of an engineering leader working at a large US based technology company in Silicon Valley, California. Our company hires the best among the top one percent of STEM students who graduate from US universities. Our company's competitive advantage is our innovative employees who build great software products, and so we go to great lengths to find such outstanding graduates. Many job positions go unfulfilled because we cannot find the right candidate or because we have to let-go foreign born graduates who donot get selected in the H1B visa lottery. This proposed rule will help us retain some of those outstanding graduates. I welcome this rule and hope it will address some critical shortages facing US tech companies like ours. 
On the other hand, I think the rules pertaining to training and documentation that companies will have to maintain will introduce multiple layers of bureaucracy that is against the Silicon Valley ethos. I hope some of those bureaucratic rules will be eased when the rule goes through the review process. 

Thank you,
Engineering Leader, 
Silicon Valley, CA, USA.
