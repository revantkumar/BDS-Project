I strongly support this rule.

As a master student in STEM, I find that strengthening the existing STEM OPT extension is of great significance to not only international students but also STEM industries in the United States. With long-term OPT extension, F1 students could achieve the objectives of their studies at the same time benefiting the U.S. with more diversity and revenue. I think it's definitely a great idea to help further drive economic growth and cultural exchange in the U.S.
