F-1 students studies from the best universities and pay back to US in the form of skills and technological knowledge they acquire in the process. This eventually supports US economy, as F1 students coming from all over the world shares a major chunk of contribution in US economy. It is highly encouraging for them if they know that their future is safe working in United States. I fully support the amendment of practical training STEM extension to 24 months from 17 months and I hope we will have less restrictions in building a better future for the country and ourself.
