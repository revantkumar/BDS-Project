I strongly support this proposed rule, and hope that it kicks in soon. We may be international students, but we contribute a lot to the US economy. Even as students we work on commercial projects as researchers. We aren't paid as much as we deserve, but do the same job that a full-time citizen would do. International students make up a huge chunk of american universities, and we pay out-of-state tuition that hugely benefits the economy. For all our efforts and resources that we put in, I think it is imperative that this proposed 24 month extension rule be implemented immediately.
