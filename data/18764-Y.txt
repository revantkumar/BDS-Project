It is ridiculous to think that OPT extension will ruin US citizens' jobs. As I know, many international students who work here are very excellent. They make many contributions to science and technology both as a student and as an employee. Many of them won't take a job paying very low just to stay in US. What's the attractive point if they get low wage here?

Besides, many US citizens are not interested in STEM jobs at all. That's why there is an extension on STEM but not on other subjects. It is diversity and many foreign students that make the STEM are not neglected. If foreign STEM students don't have enough time to bring their knowledge from classroom to real industry and can't get working experience in US, then, getting education in US will not attract foreign students any more. That's terrible to US science and technology if diversity disappear in STEM.
