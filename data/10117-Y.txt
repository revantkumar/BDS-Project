It is commonly known that students in STEM are pivotal human resources for a nation. The STEM is US is the strongest all over the world, attracting over 300,000 international students to study in STEM. It is readily to expect most of them will greatly contribute to the nation's economy, national security, and cultural diversity if they have longer time stay here. By contrary, if they are forced to leave, those talents educated in US in the past 4-5 five years will have to find positions in other countries, impairing the nation's competitiveness in the long run. Therefore, I think the training opportunities for F-1 students should be improved and expanded in February, attracting most of the STEM students to work here.
