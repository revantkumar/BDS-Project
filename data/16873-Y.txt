I hope this new rule can be approved. To tell the truth, I think 12-month opt is too short to deliver more results to current team. My team is contributing to the new service of Amazon, PrimeNow. It's quite big project and will last for several year, leaving halfway would result in a big delay. Besides, these international students and new graduate hire largely stimulate consumption and promote an economic growth. For example, in Seattle, the catering and real estate industry become much more prosperous than they used to be. It is largely caused by these international people working there. What a big a loss it would be if they are forced to leave US. What's more, I do not think this new rule will influence the employment rate of american citizens. Technical fields need so many people, and sometimes the foreigners can be considered only when they show much better than the American citizens. Also, the E-verify program also prevent this happen to some extent.
