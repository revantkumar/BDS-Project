I think one of all, this new rule is both benefit for American and foreign students. As we all know, United States is an immigrant country. As the greatest country in the world, immigrant is one of the main reason keep it at the top. All these immigrants are coming for different countries, different nations and different cultures. When all these people come together, they achieve great things. I don't think I need to explain more how important these immigrants are to United States.

Secondly, this opt extensions are for STEM degree only. These people had higher education both in their country and United States. These people knows what is good or bad through these comparison and if they decide continue to stay United States for several more months, I am pretty sure they can bring more advantages to US. What's more, most these STEM degree students are aim at engineering job market and according to Forbes, the U.S. has approximately 1.6 million engineering jobs. So we can see the job market is huge and a lot big tech/engineer companies they hire less than they demanded. I believe make the extension longer will make these companies can hire more people they want.
