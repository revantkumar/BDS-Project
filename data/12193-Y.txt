I strongly agree with this proposal. As an international STEM student, I chose US Universities because US provides better training programs after graduation compared to UK and Canada. The research and study in STEM field usually requires more than 1 year so it is difficult to finish a complete project within only one year's OPT period. Without the improvement of the OPT rule, I'm afraid a lot of international students would choose other countries to study. I lives in a university town, international students not only contributes to local education system and high-tech field, they also bring new boost to small businesses recent years. If the number of these students decreases, a lot of local businesses will also be hurt.
