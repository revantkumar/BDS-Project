I strongly support this rule to extend STEM OPT from 17 to 24 months. STEM OPT candidates play a very important and vital role to the growth of the US economy and gives the US an edge over rest of the world in terms of technology and talent.
I request DHS and USCIS to have this rule implemented at the earliest.
