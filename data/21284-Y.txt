I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. GOV should let students who learned in U.S. campus still make contribution for the U.S. 24-months can help them find jobs.

2. More competition can help development in the U.S. Lots of American Students do not spend enough time on studying. More competition can help them study harder and improve National strength.

3. Lots of geniuses were students who studied in U.S. campus.
