I do support the proposal. If the stem extension is cancelled, there must be a big damage for American's economy. It is a huge revenue that international students offer to US. The people with H1b pay more salary to the federal. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. It is totally against the diversity of American's civilization. If you don't support this proposal, in the future, we will see the STEM policy for American's working in Asia. This might be hurt, but it is truth.
