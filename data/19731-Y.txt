I think it is a good proposal.

People say that American citizens should be consider first, actually, they are consider first. If you go to a career fair, we could see most people are internationals and very fewer big companies are willing to talk to them. WHY? Because their American classmates have found jobs already so they don't need to go to those job fairs. What is more, US companies love US citizens much more than those temporary international workers.

Therefore, if an American and an international students have the same level of education, of course the American one should be chosen. Actually, those unemployment American people may don't have the same education level and they are not qualified for those positions. Not everyone could sit in front of a computer whole data coding math models and calculator numbers in a second without calculator. If legal and high-level educated people are kicked out, who will fill the gap? Those illegal ones?
