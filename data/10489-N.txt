The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers. Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages for American citizens.
OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers. Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.
Do not think that the informed American citizen does not know that the unemp numbers you release does not include the people no longer eligible for unemp. funds. and those numbers are greater than the number of people receiving unemp funds.
