I strongly SUPPORT the Optional Practical Training (OPT) plan. As a computer science major student, I deeply understand the importance of human source to complete a project, especially due to the increasing complexity of nowadays' projects, such as google watch, which can be divided into dozens of small parts and each part can be assigned to a group with hundred of people. Thus, OPT not only allows STEM students to follow their interest and gain working experience, but also can help high tech companies to finish a lot of big projects. Assume that, if there is not enough human source in high tech companies, they will hesitate to try some possibility with a little chance to make profit but can make the world difference if they make it.

Thus, I support the OPT plan, which can provide more room for high tech companies to choose the worker they want to hire. Otherwise, they may lack of enough human resource especially in today's society, which requires every company to try and seize every chance to win.
