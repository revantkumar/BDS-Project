Quan White I stronly support this new policy as the international students give much contribution to our great nation.I cannot understand why there are so many citizens who are against this policy.
International students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.
Our country has an great ability to recognize and respect different people from all over the world as well as their cultural identity. They has become an indispensable part of our great nation.
