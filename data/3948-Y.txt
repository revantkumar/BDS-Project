I strong agree with the OPT extension rule for the following reasons:
1.Practical training is frequently a key element when a potential international students decide whether they enroll an educational institute or not. Because U.S. can offer the potential students the best practical training opportunity, it became the number one choice for international students. And International students have made significant contributions to the United States both through the payment of tuition and living expenses. In 2013-2014 the number is $26.8 billion. If the OPT extension rule will not be passed, many potential international students will pick other country as their destination to study, such as Canada or Australia and so on. Almost every countries try to attract more international students to their country. For example Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country. I think the new OPT extension rule follows the trend of the times. And both U.S and international students can benefit from it.
2.Nowadays the STEM field need a lot of employees. Almost every country has its policy to attract STEM talents. And STEM international students can alleviate the problem. So international students in STEM fields not only wont steal American peoples jobs but also contribute through research, innovation and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S economy. So the OPT extension rule will boost the IT development.
