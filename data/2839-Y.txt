The US needs international STEM students.

The big group of international STEM students are creating money and new techniques in the US, plus, most of students with OPT are not paid as high as full employees. Many work as interns. They have passions and they are cheap labors.

If the extension is not approved, many highly educated students will leave US and become valuable resources of other country. Remember that a big portion of the graduated students are paid during their study in the US for work as teaching or research assistant. Why China and India have been growing so fast? They have labors which is the most important thing for development of civilization.
