Ziteng Li I believe giving international students the choice to extend their opt is the right thing to do. A lot of people are arguing that this harms US citizens' chances of getting a job. I can imaging how they came to this conclusion but there is some serious flaw in their arguments. Employers are willing to hire some international students because they are qualified. I don't believe they have any reason to prefer hiring F-1 students other than qualifications (F-1 students need sponsorship which cost them money and resources and thus should have a disadvantage). They hire because they need qualified people. The amount of students who have US citizenship AND STEM background is not enough for the industry's need. Less F-1 students working simply means less work force for the industry and more empty positions. There is plenty of jobs in the STEM field. Some people just don't realize the reason why they can't get a job is because they are not qualified, not because there is someone else that took their job.
