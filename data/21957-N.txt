I am seriously disappointed that foreigners will once again be taking jobs from Americans. Mr. Obama, you're not the 
President of the world, you are the President of the United States of America and should be protecting us first and everyone
else second. I can't imagine why you are so hard on us when we are the people who voted you in office. Please do your job
of protecting the American people first. Please adhere to our constitution which you swore to uphold and be the one who 
unites and not the one who divides
