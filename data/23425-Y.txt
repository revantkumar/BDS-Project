I strongly support this improvement for the F1 students. I believe this improvement will be a 2-win strategy for both F1 students and US economy.

As we all know, the people who can use opt are high educated students. They can bring their talents and their knowledgement to US development. As the world strongest country, attracting brilliant students to the country has a lot benefits.

Since F-1 students have learnt knowledge from US, it is for granted that US should make use of their resources to develop itself.

So I am in favor of this extension.
