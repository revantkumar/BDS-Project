In my opinion, I believe that opt program abuse is so prevailing that it cannot be accepted for US public. Nevertheless, I do believe that there should be common ground as US should retain talented foreign students while preventing abuse of opt program. There are several ways I suggests which may improved by steps.

(1). setting up back list of companies which abuse opt and H1B, and whose name on it will be barred from using opt program.
(2). very high prevailing wage requirement for employers to recruit students on opt.
(3). opt program should only be available for students from top university which rank range from 100-200 us university and the current definition of accredited universities is too vague to explain clearly.
(4).more talented students attend the opt program thus economy of the US would prosperous.

From what we discussed above, I strongly suggest that opt should be extended to 24 months, which will give more talented people opportunities to develop themselves and they also make contribution to the US.
