As a student who is doing double major math and accounting. i think opt extension is really needed. i am doing the "STEM" major because i really like math and i wamt to find a job relates to it. Extended Opt will definitely give me the opportunity to find job opportunities and also doing something most people may not want to do(Math major is kind of annoying for most people). Extention for stem major can not only make most talents international students stay in American, help the economic growth of America, but make students themselves get the opportunity to do what they really like.
