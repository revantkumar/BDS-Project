Rebecca Hou I strongly support this proposal because it benefits the economy and development of the United States. 
First of all, International students helps increase domestic consumption and create lots of local employment opportunities. According to NAFSA, from year 2013 to 2014, international students contributed 26.8 billion dollars and created 340,000 job opportunities. STEM OPT students not only contribute in local economy with their daily expenses and their education expenses but also with their entertainment expenses and travel expenses. 
Second of all, OPT extension students(STEM students) helps balance the demand and supply of the job market in STEM related fields. The number of American talents of STEM related fields in the United States can't really meet the increasing demand. Having STEM OPT students working in the US can help fill the gap. Some people may worry that STEM OPT students are taking job opportunities from US citizens and cause unemployment for US citizens. However, the umemployed US citizens are usually labor-intensive workers, blue-collars and veterans, who are hardly capable of doing STEM related fields jobs. Therefore, we can't blame STEM OPT students for unemployment of US citizens.
In addition, having STEM OPT students working in the US helps with the development of technology. Many technical companies were founded by STEM OPT students, Mike Krieger from Instagram for example. These companies create lots of job opportunities and increase US economy. Lots of technical companies such as Google, Facebook are hiring lots of STEM OPT students as engineers. These students can be considered as the main force of creativity and productivity. On the other hand, for STEM related fields, one year OPT is not enough for employees to work on a project, the 24 months extension will definately help.
