I am strongly with the policy. Letting some F-1 students come into our job market and compete with our kids would force our kids to study harder and become more competative. Everyone's being more competative makes US the most powerful conutry today. Why should we urge the F-1 students to go away by cancelling the OPT extension ? By the way, some international stidents leased one of my houses which makes me several thousand bucks a year. I do not think I could get that money if the OPT extension is cancelled--the students would probably move away andgo back to their countries!
