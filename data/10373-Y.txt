swatilekha saha Improving and Expanding Training opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant students with STEM degrees is definitely a positive move. I completely support this new proposal which will give International students a real time experience in their respective field of studies.
Being an International student I have relied on the STEM program which has a major influence on pursuing my Masters in United States. If I would not get a relevant Industrial experience after completing my studies, I would never think of investing thousands of dollars to pursue higher studies in US.
I am little conscious about the mandatory mentorship program. For small companies or start ups it might be difficult to provide a mentorship program which will eventually prevent them from hiring eligible F-1 students. Implementing the mentorship program might badly affect the non-immigrant students hiring process.

I request you to please take necessary actions to implement it before the existing rule is voided in Feb 2016.

Thank You!
