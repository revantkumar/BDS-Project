This is a totally unnecessary program that skirts Congress's role in lawmaking; they are supposed to have legislative decision making power regarding immigrant labor issues. This proposed rule also dilutes the market for US citizen's labor in fields that have strategic importance to the future of this country- it does not benefit the United States to bring in and potentially train foreign nationals that can and may ultimately leave removing the desired skill sets when we should incent our own citizenry to fill this demand. Please end this F-1 Gap relief program. It makes little sense.
