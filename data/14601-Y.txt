I appreciate DHS to increase to 24 months OPT STEM extension. However, Mentoring and Training Plan proposed rule will be make big problem for employer. Employer will hesitate to hire stem opt students because it will make heavy burden to make documentation. Indirectly, this rule are door closing for international Student.
