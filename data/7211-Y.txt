Sean Thorndahl This OPT program is rather ridiculous in the way that it is lottery based and my government is thinking of extending it rather than providing a large H1B cap! Do you want more terrorists disguised as OPT holders in this nation if this becomes reality? OPT work force will definitely accept lower pay for the fear of losing the privilege, and this is good for no one except for the bloody IT giants who, should I say, irresponsibly spy on its own people? The real tech company like Lockheed Martin, or gov orgs like NASA will not accept foreigners so the OPT program cannot really benefit these REAL realms that need the talent, it only provides more opportunities to the disgusting indian consulting companies, converting the OPT workers into H1B while sharing a portion of their salary. Wake up and protect US citizen's job positions, protect really talented foreign students to not suffer from this luck based lottery system, and protect this nation against social instability implied by OPT extension!
