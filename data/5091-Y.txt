Jing Ai I agree with expanding STEM OPT to 24 months. 
1. It will give international students the great opportunity to practice what they had learned at USA. 
2. The employer also can benefit from this because the student can work longer at the company. The company always spend large amount of time and HR resources to bring the new employee on board and offer the training. The longer the employee stay, the much contribution she or he can make.
3. The STEM students are equipped with great knowledge and experience that can help the company go to success. They also bring some fresh air to the company.

Thank you.
