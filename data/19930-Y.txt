Currently being a STEM F-1 student under 17-month OPT extension, I have personal experience of taking more opportunities to continue my professional training during the extension. The future installation of a 24-month extension after the first 12-month period would benefit many STEM students like me, who desires to explore their research interest and expand their professional networks. 

The proposed new extension policy is crucial especially to those who are going through the status transition from F-1 to H-1B, offering them more opportunities to enter the H-1B lottery pool. Hearing so many devastating stories of my fellow colleagues and friends having to give up their jobs after their unsuccessful attempts in the H-1B lotteries, I am deeply concerned about my future. Although I am currently under the 17-month OPT extension, there will be only one opportunity for me to enter the H-1B lottery before my EAD expires. Should the proposed 24-month extension apply to my case, I would be given another chance if I failed in the first lottery.

In all, I am for the proposed changes in the existing OPT extension policy, and hope that the proposed new policy would apply to STEM students like me who are currently under the 17-month OPT extension.
