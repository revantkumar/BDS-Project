I strongly support the proposal. This is a rule that will benefit both the US and the international students simultaneously.

This rule will significantly increases the interest of international students in studying in the US since they will have the opportunity to exercise what they learn after they finish their degrees. Right now the economic development is heavily in the technology sector, where a lot of international students are contributing to the US economy. If this rule does not pass, a large number of international students will be discouraged from coming to study in the US, which will impair the growth of the technology sector and other industries in the US.

Besides, international students and scholars have contributed a lot to the US development. In fact, the US is an immigration country. So it makes sense to give them the opportunity to contribute more to the US.

Furthermore, international students aren't taking away job opportunities from Americans. Most of the opportunities for international students don't overlap with what typical American students apply for. So the competition is exaggerated.
