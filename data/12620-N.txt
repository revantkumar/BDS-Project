I strongly opposed this program. The US already graduates more STEM trained college students than jobs exist for, by implementing this.....even more of these will go unemployed. The objective here is clearly to deprive native born Americans from employment opportunities. This program will prevent funds from flowing into social security and medicare and will therefore increase the national debt. This is a totally bad idea. Do NOT issue this regulation!
