From a professional standpoint, I don't see why this wouldn't be accepted. In technical and scientific fields, qualified individuals come from many places. It's true that the US produces many qualified researchers and engineers, but the demand for these technically minded people remains high. Developing expertise in a technical field takes many years and it makes sense that employers would rather keep their experts in their jobs as long as possible to avoid the cost of retraining new employees. I don't see that this would be taking jobs from American's in any way. Rather, it would allow people who already have jobs to stay in them longer. This would be a major benefit to both the employee and their employer.
