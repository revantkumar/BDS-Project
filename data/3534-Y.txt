I strongly agree with the new regulation to change the extension time from 17 months to 24 months. Just as the benefits mentioned by the USCIS office, the extension can 
Increased ability of students to gain valuable knowledge and skills through on-the-job training in their field that is often unavailable in their home countries;
Increased global attractiveness of U.S. colleges and universities; and
Increased program oversight and strengthened requirements for program participation, and new protections for U.S. workers.
Besides, STEM can provide sustainable high-quality workforce to the U.S. if the workers has proved to be well-qualified in their positions. To be honest, STEM is a program fits right to the workforce shortage in the U.S. society. If the extension has been revoked, it is hard for companies to search right match in great volume of qualified workers, including foreign students.
Additionally, STEM is a way to express American dream. Thousands of Americans were previous immigrants from other countries. This is supposed to be a broad-open minded country. It is the openness that bring so many foreign students to come to here and pursue their American dream. Do not cast them out because of some fear of losing job opportunities to foreign workers. Foreign students in STEM are just the supplemental part for the American workforce, not a substitute.
In all, I would highly recommend people see the regulation in reasons and mind. It would bring more benefits to the U.S. society.
