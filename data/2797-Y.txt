As a Principle Engineer working in the oil and gas industry, I would like to support the STEM OPT program.

We hired a Chinese student majoring in Ocean Engineering this January and he really did a good job in Engineering. He is good at both math and English and he helped me a lot whenever I need him to do the tedious and difficult calculation for me. Thanks to his effort, we improved our efficiency greatly. Although he did not get the lottery for H1B visa this April, he can apply for STEM OPT and get another chance next year.

However, if the STEM OPT is terminated, he has to leave our company. What a pity to force him to go back home when our business is growing. In addition, many American students are not so good at math as he is. We would waste a lot of time in finding an equally competent guy to take place of him if we have to. What's worse, our business will be undoubtedly impaired if this talent boy has to leave.

The United States has been welcoming talents from all over the world for more than 200 years. Why we need to force those talents back home? China, of course, will be glad to bring this talents home to strengthen their technology and drive the U.S. out from the west pacific. Russia will be glad to see that U.S. lose the talents in STEM majors. Why the U.S. need to weaken ourselves and fortify our potential opponents?

For the above reasons, I would like to vote for the STEM OPT.
