Yongguang Zheng Someone said OPT extension might take the jobs from domestic employments. However, I think it won't be a concern for domestic employees. Most jobs for STEM degrees do need international hires. It's obvious that expanding OPT term will benefit both American society and international students. Most international graduates only acquired conceptual knowledge from school, working for a part-time or full time job really help them gain practical experience. In addition, OPT extension has higher requirement for international graduates that the hiring company must provide the evidence that hiring them is necessary and won't have negative impact on domestic employment.

It's no doubt that OPT extension is more beneficial than revoking it.
