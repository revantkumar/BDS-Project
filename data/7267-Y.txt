The proposal will benefit both the US companies and international students in the STEM fields. As we all know that international STEM students contribute large percentage to workforce of technique companies. We can imagine the case that if the proposal failed, the companies will lose hundreds of thousands of employees who contribute great effort to the company which could cause unexpected negative effect to the US economy. In the future, company cannot hire enough employees especially technical people to do their job because international students could stay so short after graduation and even though they are hired by companies, several months taken for training and the actual time they could make contribution is only several months. If they have 24 month extension, we can devote all the 24 months to work and contribute. 

To summary, the 24 months OPT extension for STEM students will benefit the country greatly and will be a double win!
