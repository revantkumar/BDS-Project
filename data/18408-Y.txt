I sincerely and strongly support this rule. 
I believe that jobs offered for F-1 students could better receive rewards and this rule could attract more smart foreign students coming to study in US. Most creative students working in US could build a more strong country like US which is just the foundation of this country.
People is the most potential power to build a strongest country like US and also the most crucial power to destroy it.
