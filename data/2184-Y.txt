I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Under the international background nowadays, the relationship between different countries intertwined with each other. Diversity becomes increasingly important. It's beneficial to let capable international students stay in the U.S and contribute to the communication between the U.S and other countries. 

2. Competition is good. It's the rule of nature. It can energize people to keep learning and improving their professional skills. Thus the average level of competence of U.S citizens can be elevated at the same time. In addition, the market will keep being prosperous and energetic.
