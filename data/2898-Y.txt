I am a retired STEM worker and a USA citizen. I worked primarily as an outside consultant to Fortune 1000 companies and state governments during most of my career. Despite the fact that my reputation for stellar performance got me called back to previous clients (as they knew my work was impeccable) the last 18 years I worked I found myself unemployed almost 50% of that time. The main reason I was unemployed was due to competition from immigrant workers here on H--1B visas who would work for less than a citizen could live on. They lived 7 or 8 to a single 3 bedroom apartment with no furniture (they slept on the floor) so that they could send most of their paychecks out of the country to family members; thus depriving the USA economy of those funds.

My immigrant co-workers often asked for help with the simplest parts of their jobs because they had lied on resumes to get here. Once they were hired and here, employers expected the USA citizens to teach the immigrants how to do their jobs. 

The periods of unemployment suffered by myself and other qualified STEM workers who were citizens had a severe effect on our retirement saving. We often had to live on those savings due to periods of being out of work.

Our government is NOT doing their job if they continue to increase those visas. They are destroying the American Dream of hard work and getting ahead and allowing billionaire investors to get even richer at the cost of the loss of America's middle class.
