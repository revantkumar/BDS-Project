I am one of the F-1 students in US.

I strongly SUPPORT the new stem degrees. The competition in getting a H1B is becoming more and more serious. Many F1 students need several times to win the lottery. If the stem extension be cut off or if it remains 17 months, many of them will need to lose jobs and even leave American. The number of people who may be in this situation in the future is not a small number and most of them are working for big companies in engineering, commercial areas. 

Imagine that thousands of these guys leave their companies. The first one who suffer most are these big companies. The second one will be the economy and technology area of America. 

Improving and expanding a new STEM degree and CapGap for F1 is a win-win deal.
