Michael Hethmon The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) is a non-profit public interest law firm and the only entity of its kind in the U.S.
which focuses on defending the rights of individual Americans and their local communities from the harms and challenges posed by mass immigration to the United States, both lawful and unlawful.

IRLI concludes that the proposed rule is unlawful. (1) Congress delegated authority to define periods of employment for F-1 nonimmigrants to the Treasury Department, not DHS. (2) INA Section 214(a)(1) does not delegate unlimited agency authority over conditions of admission for non-immigrants to the DHS. (3) DHS cannot claim discretionary authority over post-completion student employment by reference to INA section 101(a)(15)(F) or 274A(h)(3), alone or in combination. (4) The regulations introduced in the NPRM are procedurally and substantively arbitrary and capricious. (5) The OPT program described in the NPRM would impermissibly facilitate prohibited employment-related discrimination on the basis of alienage and national origin.

IRLI respectfully warns the agency in the attached letter brief (28 pages) that the proposed OPT extension rule, in its present form, cannot possibly be found to comply with controlling federal law.
