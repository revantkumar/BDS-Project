The logic behind a lot of people objecting this rule is that jobs are given to low-paid foreigners INSTEAD OF talented Americans. Truth is that each of us international students who are working under OPT went through exact same interviews and hiring process. We got the jobs eventually because we are better at what we do. There are also tons of talented Americans who have jobs in STEM field and they are doing great. This rule should make it a healthy competing environment for all the STEM students, which ultimately brings positive effects into this industry and the States. 
Thumbs Up for the extension rule.
