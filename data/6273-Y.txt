Ruiqi Wang I think it is important to realize this bill.The education of the U.S. is attractive to me not only because of the outstanding education,but also the chance to use the knowledge I have learned in practice.If the time of OPT will be shrink,sometimes it will cancel some chance for me to exercise and learn more.Since I am a student in STEM subjects,I will need more time to complete the assignment and the task,so I think it needs two year OPT to accomplish.Some classmates of mine also think the reason why they choose the university in America instead of choosing universities in English is that there will be a two year OPT in America when they graduate from universities.
