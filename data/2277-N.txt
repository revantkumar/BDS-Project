When will the lawlessness end? The OPT is just another example of a program that has NEVER been approved by Congress. That is against the law! Since when was it ever legal for any branch of our government to act unilaterally?

And why does the Judicial Branch not perform its responsibilities to prevent these things from happening.

If our three branches of government do not abide by the law, we do not have a Constitution. That piece of paper sitting under protective glass at the National Archives is no Law if it is not followed.

Sadly,
