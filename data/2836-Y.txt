YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension. Firstly, Workers from foreign country made lots of contributions to the economy of states. Just a glimpse into high-tech industry we will know that these people are driving the economy engine of the country. If we lose this prominent force, our economy lose a important engine. Further, extension is good for citizens too. if the US economy lose the vibrant power,every person in this country would be negatively affected. Not to mention the benefits that would be brought to the advancement to the technology. After all even the computers you are using was invented by foreign scientists. Given those points above, i support this extension, since it will bring benefit to every one and to the whole country.
