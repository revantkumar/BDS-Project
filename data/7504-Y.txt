Hongbin Xiao There are so many comments talking about the new OPT rule allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. However, this is not the truth.S
Actually, in most cases hiring a foreign national costs more money to the corporations as they have to take care of their visa application fees(H1B-GREEN CARD etc...) and attorney costs. And also, the law and the OPT rule set the wage and benefits standard for hiring foreign workers using OPT, they can not work with a lower wages or benefits. Both he old and new OPT rules are well considered this point to not harm American workers' benefits. 
Additionally, most STEM students pay social security taxes! MORE important, please consider this: international students contribute about $25 billion in tuition fees alone. If U.S. lost all these students, how many job opportunities in Education industry will lost? 
It's really a great new rule and it will be sure to create a win-win situation for both foreigners and American workers. Immigrants have made enormous contributions towards the building of this country. This glory should be continued and developed forever.
