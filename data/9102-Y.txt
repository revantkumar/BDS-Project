As a US citizen and a senior undergraduate in technology school, I support this OPT extension. My school is located in a small town and has lots of foreign students majored in STEM. They really contribute a lot to the school and the town whether from culture diversity or the economic development. If the opt extension is cancelled, thousands of students may choose to stay in their mother country and don't study in America. There must be severely bad influence to my school and US economy. Otherwise, I have found job in last month in California. I don't think the extension helps them to 'steal' citizen's jobs.
