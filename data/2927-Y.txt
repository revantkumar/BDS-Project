I completely support this extension.

First of all, many foreign students pay their tuition to get higher education in the US, which brings lot of money for the American universities. Extending the OPT will definitely attract more foreign students.

Secondly, lots of students who got the degrees from the American universities have the techniques needed by American companies. OPT extension can give the companies more flexibilities towards choosing the best candidates, which eventually benefit the overall economy. Many companies still prefer to hire citizens. It is not because the students have OPT. It is just because these students happen to be the best candidates and the companies are just being fair.

Thirdly, there is no way a country can stay healthy by being conservative. Attracting the best minds in the world is the key for the United States to be the most powerful and creative country on this planet. Only a healthy country and economy can create even more jobs for more people. The right thing to do is to keep it in a good way, instead of taking away the chances for the foreign students just because they are not born in the US.
