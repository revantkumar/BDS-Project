I strongly support the proposal. Excellent international students with advanced STEM degrees will definitely contribute to the scientific progress for the whole country. The OPT extension will not affect the employment pressure for citizens much. There is always competition for job positions, which makes the country stronger and more competitive in the world. For decades the U.S. have been renowned as a country that embraces various cultures and respects people from all around the world regardless of race, ethnicity, or sex. That is exactly what makes the country strong and prosperous to stand out in the world.
