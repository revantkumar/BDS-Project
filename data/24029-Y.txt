I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.
This proposal will attract more highly educated, talented, and hard-working foreigners to work for United States, which will benefit the country. More talented people working in the country will make the economy better, and then create more job opportunities for both citizens and foreigners.
And don't forget, Americans are consist of immigrants. The denying of this proposal would be contrary to the original spirit and the foundation of this country.
