Rishidhar V I Strongly Recommend the extension of the OPT from 1 year to 3 years so that the people who want to remain in the United States after completion of the Masters is a added benefit for them. the past OPT rule has not been clear and no benefit for students due to this, students should wait for the H1B visa lottery to pick up which is just one chance
This helps to boost the American economy where the Students who pay taxes for these years stay here and the local economy also boosts with the flow of people 
I think this is the best way to allow the Immigration where it is safe and legal instead of getting the Low cost skilled labor through H1B or Syrian refugees.
I recommend such that students should have the separate H1B so that they should not wait for the Visa lottery
