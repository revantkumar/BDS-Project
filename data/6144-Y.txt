I really like this proposal. This gives foreign STEM talents more opportunities here in USA, which will contribute a lot to US future success. Besides, I believe those STEM talents staying in the US will help US to create more job opportunities for US citizens as well. Those talents are more likely to build up a start-up and contribute their talents US STEM related corporations, which will greatly benefit our own people as well. If we are able to attract the world's best minds with best policies and help them to live in US, why would we not do that?
