Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 student is a certainly a good policy for United States because first, American local companies have more options to hire students who have great talent in their study field. There are a large amount Non-immigrant students who study in major of STEM, if the extension of OPT is canceled, a lot of local companies will have no chance to hire international students who are really talented. Second, most of researches need at least 2 years to accomplish, if the expanding stops, I believe there will be a lot of researches need to be stop, and this will definitely hurt a lot of Tech-companies. Third, expanding OPT will actually not hurt American's employment opportunities because most companies are only hiring Americans. American still have much more chance to find a job than international students.
