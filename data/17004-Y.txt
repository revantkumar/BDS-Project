I strongly agree with the new proposal of OPT extension. 
I'm one of the international students who is involved into a general aviation project, which will last at least 3 years. The new rule provide me a chance to follow the project until the end. If the proposal can not approved. I have to left the project and the company need to hire new employee, which wastes time and increase cost.
Most of my classmates and friends are working at great Detroit area. I can tell how the economy recovers of Detroit area since 2013. It can't recover that fast without we international Students. First of all, a lot of OPT students went into Detroit renting house or APT, which push the improvement of economy. Second, with more and more OPT students join in, the companies in this area have more support for their development.
In my knowledge, most Chinese students want to go back China for their personal development in the future. With 3 year working experience in U.S., definitely make them better competitor in China.
For the reason above, I support the new rule with no doubt.
