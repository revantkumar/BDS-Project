Stella Chen I strongly support the proposed rule. 

International students make significant contributions to the U.S economy every year. According to a report by the Institute of International Education, in 2013-2014, international students contributed more than 27 billion dollars to the American economy. If STEM students have a longer training period (12 months plus the proposed 24 months), this policy will definitely attract more students come to the U.S to study. Sine about 65% of their funds come from personal and family sources, their coming to U.S for higher education will have a positive impact on American economy.
