As a native born citizen of this country who has worked in the technology field for my entire career, I cannot support this 
initiative. During my contracting/consulting years, I visited a number of technology companies. I've also worked in number
of other companies. During this time, I've seen a vast reduction in the number of these technology positions going to citizens 
of this country. I've also seen a great reduction in the number of this positions going to minority citizens. The displaced 
positions are largely staff positions and not technology lead positions. The primary apparent goal of this displacement, in my 
opinion, was to place downward pressure on salary costs. I find it difficult when I hear government experts at a loss for why
wages are stagnant. It has become difficult for me to recommend to younger citizens, including my younger family members 
and acquaintances, a career in the technology. In my opinion, training opportunities like these should be offered first to 
native born citizens. This would be in particular a boost for native born minorities. The government of this country should 
invest in the training and welfare of its citizens (and stated in its founding documents) and not in the interested of well funded 
special interest groups.
