Why in the world would you want to hire foreign STEM student over American STEM students! American citizens SHOULD ALWAYS TAKE PRESIDENT OVER ALL OTHERS! The DHS needs to stop thinking about other countries and start protecting America and American citizens. I thought the DHS was created to protect America, not water down the citizenry with foreign peoples. As a veteran of the US Navy, I fought against foreign aggression and DHS should too!
ICE already has it's hands full trying (or not) to catch those who have over stayed there visas. Adding to or extending the visas of thousands more is not good for America. American companies should hire American citizens first. After all the American citizens who can do these jobs are employed, then and only then a few, well vetted, foreign citizens could be hired.
I know what Disney did when it hired hundreds of foreign workers. Who were trained by and then replaced the American workers. That was wrong. It only happened because the US Government promoted the foreign workers over the American workers. The US Government should promote American workers. When all of America is working, then a few foreign workers could be let in.
Until that time we should stop all immigration. Especially targeted immigration such as you are considering with this proposal.
