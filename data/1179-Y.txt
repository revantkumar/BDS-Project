I fully support improving and expanding OPT for STEM students.
Some comments say that STEM students have taken the job opportunities from citizens. However, in fact, according to U.S. Department of Labor, jobs of non-agriculture sectors reduced more than 520,000 in 2008, and the unemployment rate rose to 7.2%. After OPT program applied, the unemployment rate went down year by year. This year, the unemployment rate goes down to 5.1%, which is the lowest one in recent seven years. It's worth mentioning that 173,000 job opportunities have also been created in same year. Data shows that OPT doesn't have negative impacts on employment opportunities to citizens, but creats more jobs to U.S., so the STEM expanding should be encouraged.
