I'm one of thousands students who are facing the STEM degree OPT extension. It is necessary for me to have this extension. As you know, students are likely to spend their summer time to participate into an intern, which would at least cost 3 months. If there's no extension, which means I only have 9 months left for OPT. If I start working from June, right after I graduated, then I don't have any chance to take the H1B because my OPT would end on March. I know that many people have the same problem as me. So this extension is very necessary for us.
