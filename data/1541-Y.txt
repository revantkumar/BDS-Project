I strongly support this proposal because this plan will help United States stay competitive in technology and science development. In United States there are some best schools in the world. There are also lots of top students graduated every year who are not citizens of this country. United States spends many (best) education resources on these foreign students already, why don't we give them equal opportunities if they want to contribute here in the United States. It doesn't make sense that we spend these resources on those students and then once they are graduated we shut down the door and force them to leave for another country. What makes US a technology leading country is that we always have the most talented people. So give them equal opportunities to work here so that we can create more opportunities in the future.
