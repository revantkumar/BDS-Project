I strongly support on keeping the extansion OPT of the STEM program.
1. STEM student learn the deep and complicated concepts in US, why not have them have the opportunity to have more time to practice in the reality. Complicated subjects supposed to take more time to be proficient.
2. US is a country of immigrants, that is what makes US stronger, diversity is definitely one big reason behind the power.
3. Competition always make great ideas and creations.

Thanks.
