I strongly agree with this extension. Foreign students come to US and work much harder to find a job in US. The employment rate is still low for most foreign students because tons of companies do not support OPT, Green Card, etc. Who can find a job in US is one of the best. US citizenship should not be an simultaneous protection of US students against foreign students in finding jobs. US is one of the best nations, so only the best students deserve the best jobs. Why should US send back many of professional, highly-skilled foreign students to their own countries instead of keeping them and letting them contribute to all parts of US? Only by attracting and keeping more outstanding foreign students can US survive from more and more international challenges and opportunities.
