This is great way to improve our country.Way too many people believe this would take their job, in fact it won't and it'll create more jobs. E-verfity company are just a fraction of all and the number of international students is just very small amount. However they'll bring huge market for schools as well as real estate. I strongly support this regulation. As a Uber driver, they didn't take our job. Instead as international student often don't have cars, they usually call uber and I got a job because of this. They provide a large amount of my income as well. By not giving them opportunities for working , most of them won't even came to US. Consider about the opportunities this regulation would create, I strongly support it.
