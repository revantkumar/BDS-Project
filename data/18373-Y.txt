I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. That is what 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many great scientists and business leaders such as the founder of Yahoo and Monster and so on, before they succeeded, they are all international students. They made huge contribution to our country, because their companies provided America with more job opportunities. Their research work makes America the No.1 in Science area in the world.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition makes America stronger and increase the average skill level of every one in America.
