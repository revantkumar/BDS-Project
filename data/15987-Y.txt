I strongly agree with the proposal of OPT Extension, due to following reasons:

- F1 STEM students have tried hard and spent a lot of money to study in the USA. They have brought a big amount of benefits in economy and they deserve a fair chance to get to work here.

- If there is a longer time of OPT to allow F1 STEM students to work in the USA, more STEM students will be appealed to study here, which would in return do more good the the economy and technology development of the USA.

- There will be more competition if this policy takes place, but it's not a bad thing. More competition in technology field encourages more accomplishments. It will only benefit the USA.

- It will bring more international students in the USA, which means more diversity in schools and society. More diversity means more ways of thinking, more cultures to share, which leads to a more prosperous society.
