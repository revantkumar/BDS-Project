The proposed 24-month extension to the F1 OPT program should be strongly supported as it will provide great benefit to the US economy and innovations. The reasons are as follows:

1. The OPT program has good intentions to allow international students to intern at US companies and therefore contribute directly to US economy. Without such program, many students simple acquire the education in US (best in the world) but go back afterwards and apply their knowledge in home countries, leaving minimal benefit to the US economy.

2. Although with good intentions, the 1-year period is too short for the students to effectively contribute in most of the engineering or science field. Most of meaningful projects in any STEM-related companies has R&D cycle considerably longer than several months, not to consider that the academic-industry transition requires some time for any fresh graduates to adjust. This leads to less effective utilization of the OPT program, both from perspectives of the students and the companies.

3. A longer OPT allows US companies to be more flexible in acquiring talents in the STEM field. More time and effort can be spent in identifying compatible candidates, rather than selecting merely based on work authorizations. Only through a much broader, diverse talent pool, the US companies can maintain their edge in innovations in the world.

4. All these direct benefits to US economy can in turn attract more bright students from all over the world to the US for education, further enhance the leading role of US in innovations.

Overall, the extension of OPT program to 24-month for STEM students should be strongly supported.
