Honesty, the expand OPT is good for the USA society. 
1. for government:The low employment is not because the competition from internationals. It is actually people are too lazy to equip them with knowledge or techniques to work! Which one do you think has higher number? Lazy people who stay at home without work but paid well with government assistance? Or internationals who are hardworking and produce benefit to the whole society??
Also, the expand of OPT actually lower the chance of those foreign labor to stay for long term. It brings more cruel "natural selection" for them and this can help us to select more outstanding foreign labors. 

2. for companies: they have wider range of choices. Most international employees are more hardworking then the native workers. Especially for some big international companies, it is necessary to have some people with more diverse background. 

So, these people with STEM background are actually top people around the world. They definitely can bring more productivity to the US, it's good to let them work for us for longer time.
