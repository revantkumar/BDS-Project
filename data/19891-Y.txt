I strongly support the new proposed STEM OPT extension rule because of several reasons below. 
First, some people oppose the rule because they are lack of understanding that the OPT extension is only available for the STEM international students, not for all foreigners. We should be aware of the fact that the percentage of the local US students of STEM is obviously much lower than the other fields. That means if we do not extend the OPT, there will be much less students working for the high tech companies, and the labor force in STEM field will run down rapidly. 
Second, someone may argue that the H1-B are the same (36 months), but please notice that there is a strict H-1B quota in each USCIS fiscal year and a policy that people who applied for STEM are only allowed to work in e-verified companies. If OPT for STEM is 36 months which means even if STEM students can not get an H1-B eventually, they can still work for those US companies for 3 years which makes real contribution to the companies/organizations since the initial training would take up a long time. It will be a waste of resource and time for both the companies and students if the students have to leave when the students just have gotten familiar with the industry and the operations of the companies.
All in all, the OPT extension will benefit for the US government, the US citizens and the international students.
