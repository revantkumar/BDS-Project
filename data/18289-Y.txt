I think it's good news for both international students and the country.
1. International students get more time to have more comprehensive training; it will ensure they learn more skills and knowledge before they officially join in the companies and work for them. 
2. The country will benefit from the new policy. The country get more international intellectual.First, STEM students will have more time to really know the jobs and the country; after they knew the american work style well, they can make wise decisions to work or leave. In this case, the country recruited people who really wants to work and enjoy working in the US. Second, they will be more likely to stay and work for US. They will be given more time for the extension, so they will be grateful for the new policy and more likely to work.
3. Even though people may choose not work in US, the experience they learned during the OPT and extension will help them in the future. It's a cultural export/influence on those graduates.
4. It will not change the domestic employment, at least not significantly, I assume.
