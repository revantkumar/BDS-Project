I do not see why we do not give higher priority to our own, US based, STEM students instead of importing STEM workers from other countries. The only advantage I see to this policy is to provide employees to large corporations that can be paid lower salaries then home grown, US based, employees would have to be paid. This is not what our government is supposed to be doing to its workers.

A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that you proposes to expand:
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
These two facts are outrages and shows a callous disregard by our Federal Government for the well being of its citizens.

I strongly suggest that the US not pursue expansion of the OPT program.
