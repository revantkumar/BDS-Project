I highly apporve this policy not only for international studentsbut also for United States
Firstthis is a very important reason for many tanlented students coming to the U.S. Just consider European contriesthey don't or may not have such a policy that elites all over the world may not consider to go there insteadthey come and contribute to America. 
Secondly I guess you don't know much about international studentsmost of their motivation to study in the U.S. is that they have a chance to work here for a fair amount of periodif they would not be able to have that chancethay might not even consider coming to the U.S. Then I think the economy will be effected badly.
Besides, think about employers, they might have taken a year to develop some good employees, after that they're not alowed to work here anymore, why would they ever employ any international students? If not, a huge amount of positions will be empty and never enough local students would ever fill up the big hole.
Please think about the U.S. yourselves, OPT extension for STEM is really a good idea.
