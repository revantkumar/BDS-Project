Why should non-citizens receive help through hiring incentives then Americans? This is underhanded and harmful. With working age individuals (16-62), there are 72M unemployed, based on 147M tax returns filed in 2014, a population of 318M citizens on Jan 1 2014, and 219M working age citizens. This boils down to a 33% unemployment rate. How could you, in good conscious allow foreigners to have greater precedence then us?
