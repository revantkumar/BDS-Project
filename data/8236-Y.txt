I strongly agree to this policy. It will attract more foreign students to study in US. Each year international students spend over BILLIONS of dollars here IN US. This will create numerous jobs and help the economy greatly. As the number of international students has grown, a whole industry aiming at foreign speakers has thrived. Therefore, I strongly agree to this policy.
