NEW STEM OPT is helpful to the US universities and companies.

For the universities, they charge more tuition and fees than in state or out of state students, it is a large part of the money to support their daily work. That is the reason why a lot of universities try a lot of ways to absorb the international students, If the OPT STEM failed, what the universities did is in vain and I believe they need to shrink their budget and thus a lot areas cannot improve.

For the companies, they now hired students in OPT, if the OPT STEM is failed, they need to hire some immediately to fill the position. You can imaging how hard it would be to fill the experienced position if a lot of people are forced to leave. It would be a pain for the enterprises.
