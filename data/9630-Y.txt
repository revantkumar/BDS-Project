Congying Wang I approve this improving and expending training opportunities. The F-1 students bring fresh labour force to U.S. while they use other countries' resources before they can be a labor in the market. It saves a lot money for US. Moreover, every F-1 student can create two positions for US citizens. F-1 students' OPT expanding is creating job opportunities.
