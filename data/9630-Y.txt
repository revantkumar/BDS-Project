I strongly support this extension, not only because this extension will give foreign students a better chance when they hunt for a job, but also this will help economy of US.Many international students, especially those from China and India, are really good at STEM related jobs, since many of them are well trained in mathematics and computer science. In other words, they can really help to improve the technology and efficiency in certain firms. Taking the number of those workers into consideration, they will make contribution to certain industry in the US and also do good to the whole economy.
