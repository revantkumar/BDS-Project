I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. OPT is a great advantage that attracts international students come to U.S to study, which brings a great amount of money to U.S High Education System, which is really essential to keep U.S as worldwide lead in almost every research areas. These money is also good for citizens by help launching a great number of supporting programs in universities, bring more people to advanced education.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. As we all know, United States was built up by people from different countries and it's just because people from different backgrounds, having different knowledge that makes this country stay on the top of the world, and keep attracting millions of talent people to join and contribute to this country.

3. Competition always exist, but is not a bad thing. If there is no competition, the country would also lose its competition worldwide. International students are not coming to do things with low wages, they help with the most advanced technologies that United States people need.

4. Additionally, there are a lot of startups created by people who used to be international students. It help create a great number of job opportunities to this country.

5. Now many research programs are not easy to do, so 12 month is really short for them to finish. It means some laboratories have to give up very important programs which has already been invested billions of money just because international researchers have to leave United States. That's really a loss.
