I fully support the extension of OPT. This is an important policy that is beneficial to both nonimmigrant F1 STEM students as well as companies and institutions in US that have an increasing demand for STEM major employees.

One one hand, the extension of OPT for STEM international students help them to improve their professional skills by having the opportunity to stay in US companies and institutions for a descent a mount of time. On the other hand, by providing training opportunity to STEM international students, corporations in US are able to alleviate their ever-increasing demand fro STEM major employees and improve their efficiency.
