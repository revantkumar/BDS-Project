I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Let gives the small company a chance!

Small companies, or set-up ones, dont love to hire international students, they have to! Who will really want to hire someone could only work for 1 to 2 years, or even have to leave just after the NEW HIRE TRAINING! In job fair, most big and famous companies have posts written Citizens and Permanent Residents Only, so they hire what they want, intelligent American citizens; however, for smaller ones, they have to talk to internationals and offer them jobs. Because they also need someone to work on the models and projects. American citizens dont like their heavier tasks and unstable future. 

However, if we want to send those international home after graduating immediately, we take the last chance for set-up companies to growth big. Therefore, it is not that internationals are stealing citizens jobs, they are just filling in those unwanted ones to help set up small companies. To extension whole OPT period to 3 years will help set-up companies with a more stable future and give them a longer time to build a good base, which enable them to attract citizens at last.
