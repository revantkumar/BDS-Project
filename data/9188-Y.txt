Valerie Henderson I am very disturbed by the prospect of the Optional Practical Training program being renewed and/or expanded. OPT allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. What about my son who needs the same on the job training? A college grad with no job? 
It seems that instead of helping foreigners we should be thinking of ways to help the college grads that cannot pay their college debts because they don't have jobs!
The proposal will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months and will create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. What about the Americans that cannot find work? Working toward a work visa is also in direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. 
It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
No OPT and No Extension to 36 months and No extension to STEM creating a bridge to longer-term work visas for these student workers.
