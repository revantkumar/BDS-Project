I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

As an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2015 with a master degree in information systems. I would like to state my comment on the benefit to extend STEM OPT

If we looked the current economic model in the US. High tech companies escipically IT organization needs a larger tech-savvy workforce to maintain their growth and innovation. Not only the companies in the IT industry but also traditional industries. Most of the traditional industries companies are going through IT transformation which requires to have skilled talents to support their business activities.

In the development countries, there aren't such thing called OPT to allow student have their practical training withint the real world working enviroment to prove their education and their acquire skills and specialized knowledge in their field of study.

Having STEM OPT extension will also help reduce the number of people apply for H1B visa. Currently, there are too many people apply for H1B and about 70% of people did not get their H1B visa which will causes company either lose talents or have to relocate them into a different country.

Having STEM OPT extension will help create a clear path to STEM student and plan their career better while helpping companies get the more benefits in economic growth and innovation
