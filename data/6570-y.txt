Dian Berry I strongly support this rule! 

Firstly, this rule makes American's Education market more attractive than other countries such as England. Top students will come to America from the whole world and make Contribution to both America's economy and Science.

Secondly, after these talented students graduated, they will build many start-ups and create more job opportunities in America instead of taking job opportunities from us. Yahoo, Monster and so many other technical companies are all founded by the immigrants.

Thirdly, competition in job market makes USA stronger and makes the products and service in America more affordable to everybody.
