I fully support expanding the Option Practical Training program.
Its really ridiculous to say that foreigners make Americans out of job. Exactly the opposite, foreigners help keep the competitiveness of US graduates and the whole technology industry of this country.
Opposing OPT expansion is shortsighted. Now the majority of engineering graduates in almost all the universities are international students. Stopping the STEM extension will send most talent engineers back to their own country to develop their native enterprises, and at the same time, US graduates make no attempt to make progress because of no competitive pressure.
Actually the situation for US mega companies in the field of computer and electronics is not very good these years, and will surely be even worse if OPT extension stopped. You guys really want to see American companies lose their leading positions in the global market someday?
