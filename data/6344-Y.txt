Anonymous I fully support this rule but I also have following comments to make:
1. Increase in STEM OPT extension duration is a great thing.
2. Because it is associated with training program by the employers, I am a little concerned if they would consider this to be a tedious task and not employ many STEM students. Also not to forget the amount of paperwork that will need to be dealt with for providing the information to college about the mentoring and training program. Although training is important, may be for the first year of OPT it makes sense, but when we apply for extension, I am not sure how training would matter because most of the times we would already be trained in a year and start working independently to gain hands on experience and that way we learn better and try to push ourselves to be more productive and innovative.
3. Why can't the already existing rule be applied with only the increase in duration? The college anyway approves STEM OPT extension based on employment in the STEM field. 

May be some changes in the mentoring and training program can be done in the rule so that it benefits both the employers and the STEM students.
