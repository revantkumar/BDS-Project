I strongly support this act as it benefits most important industries in the united states such as high technology, finance and business, for the following reasons:
1. Cheaper labor. especially for high technology industry, as over 2/3 new grads majoring in electrical engineering, computer science, bio-med engineering, bio-chemical engineering are international students and F1 holders, and they also consist of a great percentage of new hires of tech companies. They just learned the more leap-forward technologies and are ready to practice them in industry, and therefore for those high tech companies, they can benefit from hiring those who have the insights with a lower wages, compared with senior employees.
2. As foreign market continues to grow, especially asian market, the companies who hire F1 students can adapt to the foreign market faster. And those if OPT is extended, those students have higher chance to get work visa and therefore are more likely stay in United States and help more companies to open foreign markets.
3. Extending OPT left the united states more well-educated people, and brings probabilities of more innovations. Innovation brings market, and even more job opportunities.
