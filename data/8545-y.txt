Will Solomon I strongly support this new OPT extension rules.
AS a STEM student, I am a part of the team for one project in Stevens institute of Technology now. My professor has already made a 2 year plan for this project. If the OPT extension is cancelled, my professor will have to stop his plan and find some other professional researchers to continue. There is no doubt that it will be the commonly problem. And according to report of National Foundation for American policy, 70% students who major in Electronic and 63% students who major in Computer science are international students. And mostly STEM students are master degree or PHD degree in the universities, which are benefits professors to find suitable researchers to proceed the project. Thus, if the new OPT extension is approved, many project, universities will be benefited.

Thus, I strongly support this new OPT extension rules.
