I am really support this. We studied here for years and we want use what we learned here. The OPT is only one year before, it is too short. One year in company cannot do much things. Like I am computer science major. Usually we still learning company technologies in the first year. So we cannot make much contributions. But 3 years will be much better,so we can make use of the knowledge we learned.
