Guannan Lu As a foreign student, the reason why I need the extension to be legal is not because I want to live in the US and get the greencard or whatever. I simply want to have a longer period of time to stay in the US so that I can gain a little bit more work experience and bring it back to my country. It's already hard enough to get a job now as a foreigner without the citizenship, especially in the visual effect industry. We have to focus on learning and spend most of our time completing our thesis, 1 year of OPT is simply not enough of time for us to find a job and take good advantages from that experience.
