(1) Discontinuing STEM opt extension is not fair to current and newly graduated STEM students. I came to US for graduate school in 2013 Fall. At that time, since everyone assumed STEM majors would have longer opt extension, STEM majors were way more competitive than non-STEM ones. We applicants of STEM majors usually needed better academic performance to be admitted. And I saw several medical doctors (MD) intentionally chose 2 years master of science (MS) program when they were qualified and more suited to apply for 1 year master of public health (MPH) program solely because MS belonged to STEM major with longer opt extension while MPH didn't, even though they needed to pay much more money for the MS program. Now we just graduated, we were in need of using that advantage, longer opt extension, we gained by having higher scores and paying more money, and a news suddenly came out that advantage would be discontinued. Is that fair?

(2) STEM extension can help US companies save a lot of money. After finishing schools, most international students, including me, would like to gain several years working experience in the US before going back to our own countries. We are well-educated, smart, young, and can be very productive workers. With the newly proposed STEM extension policy, US companies can hire us for at least 3 years without paying extra money to sponsor our working status, which would surely be a great deal for US companies.
