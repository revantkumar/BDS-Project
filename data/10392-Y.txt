As an American citizen (born and raised in the United States) that is currently getting a Master's degree in a STEM-related management field (Information Management), I support whatever we can do to make it easier for those whom I work and study with to remain in the United States and work.

We are currently facing a crisis of education and interest. There are simply not enough Americans that are educated and interested in taking STEM fields into the security, data science, and user experience fields that we need to function as a thriving economy and technologically secure society. Most of the people in my degree program (one of the top in the country) are from outside of the country. Many of them would stay and lend their hard work, discipline, and intellect to the problems that we face in the private and public sectors as a way to repay the excellent education they have received on our shores.

Until we can do something to get American men and women to fill these roles, our country's welfare is at stake. It is an invisible problem that not many realize unless one is in a technology-related field. We need their talent, knowledge, and perspectives here in the meantime.

Please consider improving and expanding training opportunities and cap-gap relief for all eligible students with STEM and STEM-related degrees. We need them. 

Thank you.
