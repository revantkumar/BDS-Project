I strongly support this rule. I know a lot of international students, they are intelligent, hard working and among the top students in the class. I feel great to work with them and I believe it will do good to development of science and industry if we can have these talented people work for the states! I don't why some of our people are so short sighted, and why we educate these F1 students only for sending them back to their country to make contributions.
