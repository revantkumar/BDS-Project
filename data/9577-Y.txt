Students who study in STEM program is a tough task. I strongly support this proposal since people will contribute to U.S. Without stem program, U.S cannot be a strong country. People who work in U.S is like live in U.S. They earn money from U.S and spend money in U.S. Why people want to refuse them? They put a lot of effort to achieve a stem program. They work in U.S as well as make U.S more strong. They contribute themselves to U.S. All the benefit is for U.S. Unlike illegal immigrants, they are legally to work in U.S.
