Muyang Li I support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.
(1) It provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after school 
training. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college
graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist.
(2) U.S. will suffer from tremendous financial loss by revoking old STEM OPT
rule and failing to publish new one.
