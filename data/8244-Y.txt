Allowing foreign Students to remain in the USA longer will continue to make it harder and harder for American students to gain degree level permanent employment. As father of four young men and a daughter in law I am uniquely aware of the competition for positions in the American economy as it is today. Allowing foreign students to remain longer only exacerbates the issue. The present law is more that reasonable and needs no change.
