I strongly agree with the arguments presented in the proposal. Providing a 24 month extension to students with stem degree will be really beneficial for both international students as well as USA. International students will be forced out of the country when their OPT expires given their H1-B visa is not picked. This rule will allow them to stay in the country, give them multiple attempts in the H1-B visa lottery and eventually contribute towards the growth of the county. Students should get multiple attempts in the H1-B visa lottery because it should not be their luck, but it should be their talent that decides their future. Students who complete their Masters in US should have some advantage in H1-B lottery because they have spent their parent's hard earned money towards their education which has contributed towards the economy of USA. This 24 months extension will not be a complete solution but it will at least solve some problems by giving multiple attempts towards H1-B visa. With the quality of education being given to the students here in USA, international students should be retained and should be allowed to contribute to the country where they gained knowledge rather then forcing them to go back to their home country and serving some other country. This rule will not affect US students because most of the companies prefer to hire citizens and permanent residents because of work authorization issues with internationals. Whereas other companies pick better candidates from a pool of all students (local or international). Also there should be limit in people applying for H1-B visas from foreign countries and no limit to students with their degrees in USA. People who have never contributed anything are allowed to work freely whereas students to spend their parent's money in expensive and prestigious universities are forced out of the country.
