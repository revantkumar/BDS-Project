This would greatly improve the economy by providing an avenue to STEM students to contribute. After all the hassles one goes through for Masters/PhD, this is a must needed one. Also, DHS should consider PhD graduates under different category in H1-B lottery or staple a permanent resident card upon graduation. If not, atleast provide them the PR at the end of the OPT. It's disheartening to see some of the best minds leaving US .
