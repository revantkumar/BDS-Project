I strongly support this new policy. 

The primary reason is that the majority projects last about 2-3 years. Companies will need to use different workers for the same projects without this extension. 

Also, the OPT STEM policy is of great value for US educational institutions. A lot of students come to the US rather than other countries because of this OPT policy, which allows them to work for more than 1 year after school. If the extension was canceled, then it would be a big big financial loss to the US educational institutions. 

I saw some people worry about the immigrant problems with OPT students, which is not misunderstanding. OPT is very selective, especially OPT STEM. If US wants to take the immigrant issue more seriously, we should pay more attentions to the illegal immigrants instead of those potential talented immigrants, who have been creating great values for the United States.
