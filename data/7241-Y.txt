I think this is a very positive initiative by the DHS. Aiding highly skilled workers with STEM degrees not only accelerates technological growth but also supports the economy by creating more jobs and bringing in more tax revenue. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness.
