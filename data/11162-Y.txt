I vote for STEM extension policy. As a STEM student, extension policy is one of the major reason that I chose the program because it offers longer permission to stay here for work. I cannot take that USCIS use this policy to attract international students and then the policy is abandoned leaving us nowhere. For the employers, I think it would also be trouble to deal with the situation that employees will have to leave US because the policy abandoned. I think the best solution now is to the extension policy to maintain legal status for current employees and also convince international students that US policy is not that uncertainty or untrusty.
