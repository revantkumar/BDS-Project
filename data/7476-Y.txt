Amy Hudson You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. International students have become integral to the financial health of many US higher education institutions, but the impact goes beyond money spent on tuition fees and living expenses. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
