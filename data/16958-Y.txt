I totally agree, some comments said citizen lose job. For this point, check out university around USA, for STEM phd and master, how many of them are citizen? If the job require Phd and master degree and just citizen, do you think this necessary and requirement is balance? Also, look around, international student study hard and work hard to get here, this policy is worth we get it.
