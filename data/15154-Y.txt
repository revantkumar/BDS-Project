YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension. . As a H1 visa holder, I have experienced the whole process of OPT application and OPT STEM extension, in my humble opinion, OPT is an important and possibly the only way for foreign students to practice what they learned in the university in United States. They do not contribute to the low average wage, they do contribute to the ground of scientific and engineering innovation in lots of field.
I currently is working at top tier IT company in America, and most of my colleagues are from foreign countries and they are really talented and helpful people that make a great contribution to the company as well as the society, I would strong support the opt extension to give more international students the chance to practice and learn in the united states industry.
