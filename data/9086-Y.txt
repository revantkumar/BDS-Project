I strongly to suggest that the government should improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees and gap-cap relief for all eligible F-1 students.

1. It is very good to let students who learned the knowledge in USA to make contributes to the USA

2. Lots of the outstanding people who make significant contributes to the USA are the international students

3. Many employees who continuously make large contributes to the companies, like google, were international students before

4. There exists the competition, but it really help american citizens to work harder.
