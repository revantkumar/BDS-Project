I support the OPT extension for the following reasons:

1. USA as an immigration country itself is and has always been welcoming talents around the world to come and contribute to the US economy and technology. This with no doubt makes US the world's leading nation in terms of many aspects. US has done so in the past and the positive effect that results from it is huge and obvious. I believe this generosity should always be carried on and so the positive effect can be consistent as a result of it.

2. America's economy is strongly supported by foreign talents. A shorten period in OPT will make lots of, lots of talent people leave. Big companies cannot afford the loss and hence the result would be catastrophic. No wise government would make such an abrupt change in their policies. 

3. US citizens may think the foreign talent take their jobs away. I don't think so. Those talents work so hard to get their job in a fair competitive environment and they earned it, they deserved it. If they leave not enough people would be capable to do those jobs. Think from another side, this is not a negative thing to US citizens AT ALL because those talents brings up the competition and because of the competition the whole nation in the long-term will only get better and stronger.

4. Before they got a job they have to invest a huge amount of tuition that of course is a big benefit to the US economy. If OPT is shortened their investment may not seem so rewarding. A huge loss will also generate from this part as well. (A typical academic year costs a foreign student $60,000 inclusive living expense)

In conclusion, US government should see the longer benefits the extension brings to the nation instead of the short-term and temporary solution it brings to calm its people down.
