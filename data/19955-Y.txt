I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer science PhD student from China. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my PhD degree in US, Canada, Hong Kong. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

STEM students get things done well, generate Tax and pay social securities. They obey America rules, and make huge amount of wealth for America. They will make America great again!

From another perspective, I do not think STEM students will hurt American citizens' job opportunities. First, about 90 percent of US companies only hire students with green card. The chance for an international student to find a job in America is much harder than US citizens. 

Second, almost all STEM students work in the high-technology industries like IT industry. The reason why IT industry in America is No. 1 is because all elites in the world are here. The growth of America's IT industry creates more job opportunities for everyone (also US citizens). If STEM extension is cut, maybe the world IT center will be in China, India, or European, or somewhere else. Does US government want see this?
