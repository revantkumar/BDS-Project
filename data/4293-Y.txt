Werner Hoermann As a scientist and entrepreneur, who has hired and worked with a large number of STEM graduates in the US and overseas, I speak from actual experience: 
Any contribution of a new hire in any STEM field depends on two qualifications, education and experience. Of those two, experience is significantly more important than education, since the academic field is typically too far removed from real world necessities and challenges.
Thus a recent graduate will be a net contributor to any enterprise only after a lengthy on-the job training period, which can last from 1 year to 5 years, depending upon the complexity of the field of activity and simultaneous progress in the industry.
Only those unfamiliar with the real world or with ulterior motives would therefore advocate to allow recent graduates to compete in the US employment market with native job seekers with the patently false claim that it would benefit the US economy. The only short term benefit it may bring is that it will depress wages in the field and might make the enterprise more competitive globally. However, the flip side of this approach is that the experience gained by the foreigners getting the on-the job training, will be carried with them to foreign countries afterwards, thus producing a large negative effect on the competitiveness of the domestic US workforce.
To further the interests of the US citizenry, it would be prudent to eliminate, rather than lengthening the employment opportunities for foreigners after conclusion of their studies.
