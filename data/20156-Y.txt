I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. The US government has spend millions toward the education programs of international STEM students. It doesn't make sense to just kick them away with their degrees. In other countries, for example, in Singapore, international students are required to work at least two years before they can leave with the degree.

2. The international STEM students helped to ease the work force shortage of high tech fields. America has the lead in those fields and US citizen graduates cannot fulfill the desire of high tech work force.

Let's make America great again.
