I support this rule. I read some of negative comments and find their logic difficult to follow. First, I do not think this rule is placing internationals over US workers. There are quite a few regulations ensuring the proper use of OPT, which placing US workers a beneficial situation. Second, some comments that international STEM students will steal their job because they accept low wages, which is obviously not the case. The truth is US companies hire international STEM students only if they cannot find qualified US candidates. And data show that that US is still short of high-tech workers in STEM field, which means we have enough positions for qualified US workers and international STEM students.
