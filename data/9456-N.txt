I strongly object to ANY program that places foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market competition or the education competition. There are way too many out of work US Citizens AND Veterans right now. We need to tighten our immigration and freebies to non-citizens. Whether those people are legal or illegal does not make a difference while so many US Citizens are out of work and struggling! Do NOT pass any more freebies to non-Citizens programs!

I am one who has had to change my employment focus due to Federal Government mandates. This has to stop!
