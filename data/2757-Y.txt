Linda Blyn How selfish and unwise you are. 

I am in the same situation as you are, but I strongly support OPT extension, since there is no reason we should send those well educated people back, it would be a waste for America.

Besides, America is short of work forces for now, and we need those young people to contribute our nation! They are not our competitors, but other countries.

To those uneducated people who blame foreign students took their jobs, you are WRONG! Since those jobs they are working on require specific skills and it is extremely difficult to find suitable talents already today!
