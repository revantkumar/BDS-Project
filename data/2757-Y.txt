I strongly support this proposal, due to the following reasons:

1. The cohort that will be affected most severely by canceling this proposal are international students. Many international students have been excellent students in their own countries before they came to US. After years of improvement and enhancement of their knowledge and skills in US, they can make more contributions to US society. The eviction of them will be a significant loss to US.

2. As the largest immigration country in the world, US has always been famous for the diversity of her society. And thanks to the diversity brought by the immigrants, US has cultivated a culture that is integral and comprehensive. The diversity also represents one of the most important spirit of US, freedom. Against diversity is a way to against this spirit.
