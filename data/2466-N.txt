So let me get this straight. If a corporation hires a foreigner who has already graduated college, this OPT program allows them to save up to $10,000 in SS and other taxes, while if they hire an equally qualified U.S. citizen who has also just graduated it cost's them $10,000 more. The U.S. citizen does not have a prayer at being selected for that entry level job.

What am I missing here?
