I support this OPT extension. A couple of reasons are listed.

1. The most important reason is that OPT extension will keep excellent foreign students staying in the US and make contribution to US economy. As we all know, the jobs for STEM students are mostly technique based, which requires a lot of high-degree students to fill these positions. Keep these well educated foreign students in the US will definitely help improve the technology and economy development.

2. If students can get more working experience after graduation, that will be a good signal for those who want to apply to US universities in the future, by passing the OPT extension, a lot of universities will take advantage from this decision. Universities will receive more competitive application and more outstanding students will apply to universities in the US. That would be a win-win situation.

3. With rapid development of technology, a lot of job opportunities are created, OPT students help high-tech companies grow up, which also help create a lot of opportunities for Americans.
