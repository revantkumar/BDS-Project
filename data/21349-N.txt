The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers. This is crony capitalism at its finest, you should all be ashamed of yourselves for aiding in the destruction of what was once a great nation. You are all immoral and disgusting people, charity begins at home.
