The OPT extension is really necessary, not only for international students but also for the country!

Why we need an extension? I will take my area of research as an example. I am a scientist studying the resistance of HIV medications. Vaccines or drugs against viruses have saved a lot of lives. But do you know how long it takes for the development of an effective and safe vaccine or drug? The answer is at least ten years! So, an one year OPT program does not really add too much for the field. One year is only sufficient to train a fresh Ph.D. as a qualified researcher and then s/he have to leave without making any contribution! I know a lot of international students who are working or will work in pharmaceutical companies. So please give them the opportunity to fullfil their values and make contributions to this conntry.

Some people may be afraid of the competitition. But compepetition is everywhere, no matter you hate it or embrace it. Any country can perish without competition. Why US is so powerful? Because the people are not afraid of competition, in any areas. So the fear of competition should not be a reason to stop a program that is beneficial for this country.
