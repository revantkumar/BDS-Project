I strongly support the new rules for OPT extension. What makes a country to be competitive in the world? The talents. The smart guys. The proposed rules definitely would help attract hi-tech people all over the world to contribute to this country and provides more opportunities for them to stay in US. What makes the USA the USA today is hers openness, she welcomes the talents all over the world, who have dreams, who have courage to realize their dreams. She provides opportunity to everyone who dare to try. It seems that the reason given by objectors for why they are unhappy with the rule is that the OPT policy makes citizens hard to get hired or even lose their job, and I think this claim makes no sense. Competition benefits the business and thrive the country. Other than blame someone else or the policy, make yourself stronger. I believe that a smart guy would like to work with hard-working, smart, talented guys wherever he or she comes from to achieve more success.
