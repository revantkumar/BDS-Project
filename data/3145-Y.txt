It's clear that expanding OPT for those nonimmigrants is equally beneficial to US economic. The obvious trend of globalization suggests that it's important to attract competent employees without irrelevant consideration of their nationality. It's our responsibility to give help and support to benefit both them and ourselves. Personally, as a HR, I enjoy working with those excellent international students and hope the policy can help keep them in my firm in stead of kicking them out of US. From my experience, international students are usually more hard-working than natives because students who can travel so far here to study are originally more active and positive towards study and work. It's like a natural selection.
