The STEM OPT Program provides thousands of international students with the opportunity to apply their rightfully earned degree to practical use in terms of employment. People have a misconception that employers misuse this OPT to hire international workers at lower wages. This is not true. In-fact, international students have very limited opportunities to begin with, as many companies do not want to sponsor or hire immigrants. Now, imagine just getting one year of OPT with that - it limits making use of the full opportunity we came here for. We came to learn, study, and apply our knowledge in fields of science, engineering, technology and math. Please do not take this opportunity away from students who come here to contribute to the economy.
