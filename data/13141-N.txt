As our supposed representatives Congress and the President should be looking out for the citizens of this country. They swore to uphold the Constitution and laws of this country. I oppose giving more HB1 Visas to foreign students. We need to stop letting more and more illegal and legal immigrants come to this country until our 15 million citizens can find jobs or can receive the needed training for jobs. Companies want to pay less money and not have to pay their part in taxes for these students. Some companies are even requiring their current workers to train the new immigrants for their job. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. There are so many students that would like to work these jobs and are being undercut by the foreign workers. American workers should have priority in all jobs. It's their right as legal citizens of this country. I will watch what my Representatives and Senators do to uphold their obligations to us the citizens of this formerly great country.
