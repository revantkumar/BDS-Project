I highly SUPPORT this proposal. And my reasons are as follows:

Providing international students more opportunities to work at US would help improve the diversity of US society and hence make the US industry and society more energetic. Even though it may means the competition in the employment would be more fierce. It in the mean time gives the companies more flexibility in selecting their employees that can better help them improve the work efficiency. Therefore, it is also beneficial to the US econ and tech development.
