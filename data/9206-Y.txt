I was an F1 student and I was not stem. But I would strongly support the action since I know a lot of people who tried hard to get a full time job but fail to win the lottery to obtain the H1B visa. With a 60% chance to obtain an H1B visa, the hiring companies started to change the way they recruit since it's a higher cost for them to hire international students who might not get a visa and will have to return to their home country. In other words, the hiring companies will no longe hire for talents. Extending OPT time for stem students would increase their chances of getting an work visa and help the United States to keep the talent.
