Personally, I would like to say, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. There are a couple of reasons show why I would support the proposal as below. 

1. We taught those international students knowledge and skills because we want them to make contribution to our country. If they all left the U.S. after they finished their degree, then why we want to teach them? 

2. Diversity is very important in the U.S. because we are an immigrant country. Many great people in the history of the U.S. are descendants of international students. The most recent example is Steve Jobs. Let's imagine if Steve's parents failed to come to the U.S., do we still have iPhone to use?

3. Many people complained that international students took their jobs away. However, this is not the truth. For almost all the positions that hiring international students, they just cannot find enough natives to hire. Even though for some positions there are competition between natives and international students, but competition is not a bad thing. Competition helps our great country to hire and get the most brilliant talents in the world and makes the U.S. a better and stronger country in the world. So why do we want to push them away and give these talents to our competitors such as China and Germany? I heard that countries such as China are loosing their policies to attract more international talents to work for them. 

Thus, I would like to say, I would strongly support the proposal. It would benefit all of us in the end.
