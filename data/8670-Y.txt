I think this policy will greatly benefit US educational institutes.

Without this, US universities will not be the top choice for foreign students. Especially given the high tuition paid by international students, as well as competitors from other elite universities around the globe.

Without this, no students will be willing to spend years in US (e.g., doing groudbreaking research as a PhD stduent) just to go back to their home country immediately. Cancelling the policy is just insane. Top talent will just flow to other countries.

If we want to make America great again, we should embrace top talent from around the globe, rather than closing the doors for them.
