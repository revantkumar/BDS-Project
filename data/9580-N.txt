The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to America. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.
Immigration policy should serve in the interests of America, not against it. Congress should have stopped this when Bush first proposed it. It should be of more concern to Homeland that no student be admitted to the program from any place that is not a fully qualified ally of the United States and sympathetic with our ideology. Homeland should not allow any foreign citizens to be in the country without tracking the current status of each and every one of them at all times. We do not want another 911 just because we trusted foreign citizens to follow all the rules. We should follow the "trust but verify" doctrine with all foreign citizens.
