I support this regulation for another reason. Nowadays, the competition in the international education market is fierce. US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, etc., are all trying to attract more international students to study in the country. For US, International students not only contribute to the local economy, but also have some potential political influences on their home country, which in long-term will benefit the US. The OPT program and the associated OPT STEM extension are the keys to help US to achieve this goal. 12 months of OPT program plus 24 months of OPT STEM extension will attract more international students. If the policy is cancelled, US will be less attractive to international students.
