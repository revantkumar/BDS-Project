He Ren I believe it is a sensible and highly rewarding action for the United States to continue and even lengthen the STEM OPT extension for those international students who left family and home at their best age, with knowledge accumulated throughout tens of years' study, to achieve their objectives in academic, science, etc. STEM OPT grants them opportunities to study by gaining valuable, practical knowledge and skills through their job training. This is a necessary, time-consuming and crucial progress during their life journey, which might also be a remarkable step in human's odyssey, given their specialties in STEM, to challenge higher level of science and technology. 

Put more rational thinking into this initiative: STEM OPT program benefits the students, but also benefits the United States. Colleges and universities here could attract more talented international students in STEM fields, remain globally competitive in terms of student quality and academic productivity. U.S. employers will benefit from the skills and knowledge acquired by the STEM OPT students in the United States. More generally, the entire nation will benefit from increased research, innovation, consumption and other forms of activities that strengthen the nation's prosperity in economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness.
