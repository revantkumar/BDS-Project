I work on a global team at my company so I'm fortunate to work with other counties during my day-to-day responsibilities. With that said our company strives for diversity and I'm happy I'm a part of a company that makes this a priority. I've had the opportunity to get to know a few colleagues on an OPT visa and I'm happy they are part of our team. They are all very nice and outgoing and excellent in what they do. A similar theme between all of our international employees is they prefer to work here in the US for a few years to gain experience and understand how we do business before planning to move back home. This is a huge benefit because these individuals already understand our culture and priorities and we're able to work with these individuals more easily. If these individuals are forced to go home now it will a huge loss for the company as we'll lose them as an employee and face a significant amount of wasted time trying to bring others up to speed on their projects. Understanding how large companies work, I'm sure others are in the same position and if we force these international students home it will be very costly for many companies.
