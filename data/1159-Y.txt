I support this proposal,
Here is my reason

Considering the U.S. young people, lots of them do not like STEM subject, they do art, they do business, they do whatever they like, they become doctors, artist, etc. International students are filling this hole, scinse subject are difficult to everyone, international student choose these subject because U.S. Need workforce in these field, U.S. Young People don't like it, U.S. Need it , that is where international students come in. Not to compete with U.S. Students by taking less wage, but doing a job many people don't like,not even international students, to make a living in the U.S.. 
International students work in the U.S. Because this is a nice country, U.S. Allow these students to work because this county needs workforce, this is a win-win strategy.

On the other hand, picturing the U.S. Without these student, many company needs workforce in theses subjects, company have to increase wage to win over others to get workforce, increasing in labor
Cost may result in increasing products price, service price, disaster. Moveover, Less international student would like to come to study in this country, bad to economy, lack of workforce, bad to economy
