Arun Kumar I support STEM extension, without which would cause scarcity of engineers. US having the perfect infrastructure and has a platform for advanced technologies. The requirement is huge to satisfy the needs and meet the expectations. If provided STEM extension, the students who graduate from various schools can contribute their knowledge and radiate it round the world. During graduation, most of the students gain valuable information from Professors and implement their ideas for the innovation. These students develops a strong bond with the technology and make everything possible and they need a platform to implement all their ideas in the real world. When given chance through STEM extension, they will get an opportunity to build powerful applications which help the world easy to live. I would personally suggest to increase H1B count for the students who complete graduation than regular H1B holders who hail from India. Those H1B professionals earn easy money with out spreading knowledge and nowhere helps US revenue to grow. All the graduates are contributing a lot to US economy and they need is to just open the doors to explore the opportunities and create wonders. 

Hence, an already developed nation like US needs talented graduates to maintain its standards and this can only be achieved when these graduates start implementing the innovative ideas they gained during graduation for developing organizations. So, all the graduate students are to be allowed to work during STEM and they need extension to continue the same.

Thanks
