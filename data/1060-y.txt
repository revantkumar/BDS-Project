Ruozhou Fang Practical training is important for learner to master the skill they just learned. A country which has the best education system must have a good practical training session for every student to get trained. For some kind of job or project, 1 year of training is insufficient. We must have some ways to make the training time fitting everyone's need. So, an optional extension is necessary to make the OPT project a perfect training plan. Besides, International students can provide huge financial support to US society. The international students need food, products, electronic devices, clothing and so on. By let them stay longer in the US, they will be a large market for our industry. So, as I see, the new OPT extension act can be a good thing for all of us.
