STRONGLY SUPPORT this rule.

People just concerns that their children can't find a job. They should ask themselves several questions:
Is his son/daughter's major STEM related? Is his son/daughter working hard enough? STEM students is economically and technologically important for US financial development. Revoking of this rule just represents the lost of the spirit of respecting talented people and technology development.
