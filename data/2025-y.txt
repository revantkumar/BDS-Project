Mingyu Chang I think it's a win-win proposal for both intelligent international students and the great companies in USA. US has the best market system and creative culture, which allows the creation and growth of greatest companies in the world! Yet that will not be true anymore if US starts narrow its respect to people with great passion and specialties to high-tech fields, no matter nationality they are. 
Great people should have chance to make full of their potential in places with creative culture, systematic market and knowledge-respected community. And it's also true vise versa! If US narrow its own potential, it would definitely be a great lost to US, a career pity to intelligent international people, a lost to the whole world.
