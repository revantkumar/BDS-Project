This is very detrimental to the American Worker. We already have a lot of H1, L1 employees coming in from other countries and taking the jobs that the American worker can do very easily. I have seen many of these H1 workers are not doing any specialized work. They just work for a pay that is much less than what a company would have to give to a regular employee. 
Adding more workers on the OPT program is just a way of bringing in cheaper labor. The congress needs to look at the American people first before putting immigrants before them.
