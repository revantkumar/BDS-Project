President Obama haven't you done enough to hurt American workers with your immigration policies??? It's unconcienable what you are doing to this country all by yourself. I regret voting for you seeing what you're doing to our economy bringing into the country hundreds of thousands of immigrants, not counting illegals, that WE HAVE TO SUPPORT!!! You're really weak, and, in my eyes, the worst President we have ever had! You've proven time and time again President Obama your contempt for our country and the American people while shoving down our throats your Executive Orders that forces more burden on the American People and does nothing but create animosity toward each other. January of 2017 can't come quick enough to be rid of you and may God help us between now and then!
