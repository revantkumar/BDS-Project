I strongly support this rule. But it would be great if this rule is supplemented with an increase in H1 cap. Because after 3 years of OPT, a F1 student who has a good company experience and skill by that time is forced to leave if he/she does not get a H1 in three years of time due to the lottery and cap limit. It would again create a crisis for companies.
