I SUPPORT this proposal!

I am an international student, I choose to pursue my master degree in U.S. is the good policy that the U.S. government allows international STEM student to have a expanding training opportunities. Studying abroad is a way to increase my competitiveness in labor market in our own country because OPT extension helps me have more opportunities to work in U.S. and obtain working experience as well as study experience. 

Also, I think the majority characteristic of U.S. is the culture diversity. OPT extension attracts more talented people live and study here. It is beneficial for the whole country. Foreign students coming to U.S. could promote the local economy. They will consume and rent houses in U.S. which increase the income of local people.
