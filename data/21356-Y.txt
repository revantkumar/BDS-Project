Immigration today = invasion. We must stop it. We are losing the values that made our country strong. The number of immigrants entering our country since 1970 has sky rocketed and these immigrants are not truly interested in becoming Americans. They are not assimilating. They want our country to be like the one they came from. NOT GOOD.
