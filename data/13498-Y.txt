I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1.U.S.A is famous for its diversity. Once the society attracts more excellent people, it can improve faster. Diversity is very important for the U.S, many scientists and successful business men are aliens.

2. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S.A.,universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.A..

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many international students did some professional and skilled jobs. Besides, competition could help U.S.A chose outstanding genius and became better.
