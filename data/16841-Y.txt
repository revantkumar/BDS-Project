I strongly SUPPORT this proposal based on the following reasons

1.F1 students get there knowledge from US university, government should give them a chance to make contributes to the US. The OPT is not only a right for F1 students, it's also a duty for them to feedback this country!

2.Diversity is surely important for US. Many experts who have made a great contribution to their own area used to be the international students. Maybe the next winner Nobel is now struggling with the OPT extension. What's more, no innovation will be taken with a single sound and a single mind.

3.Competition do exist, but it's benefit to this country. The first reason is, international students won't take a low salary just for the aim to take jobs away from US citizens. Some jobs is more suitable for the international students. What's more, with more competitions, a great improvement will take place between all people.
