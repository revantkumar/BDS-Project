I strongly support this proposal. First of all, extension on the OPT can help attract more talents for Unite States and supply its technology industry. The technology industry of US can lead the world because of its innovation and creativity. Those abilities of Foreigner talents have been proved, such as Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella, who are both CEO of best technology companies. 
Second, more than ten thousands of international students are using OPT extension to work for and contribute their talent to Americans technology companies. The country needs the companies and the companies need those talents. If those people loss legal work status on Feb., this will be disaster for American technology industry. This won't create jobs, it will cause the outflow of talent. Because those companies hire every employee equally, they are not only hiring international students, they just hire right persons with the ability they need.
