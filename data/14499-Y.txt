Opt extension is so important that America can't afford losing it.

Manufacturing is the fundamental industry of a country. If a country is not able to manufacture one product on its own, it has to buy the product from an other country and the price is often determined by the seller. That's why every country in the world is actively upgrading its industry to be able to manufacture high value-added product. America lost not only low-end manufacturing but also many high-end ones in the past decades. So the new trending is rebuilding these high-end manufacturing. STEM students can help to do this. And first they need a job opportunity. Opt extension can keep more talented STEM students to work in America.

Strong manufacturing is good to every industry, and it has positive influence to every American. Let's bring America great again.
