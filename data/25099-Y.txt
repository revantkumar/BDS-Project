I support this new rule. Those who don't just don't know economic and the education development.
1. STEM students has created far more opportunity than the number of themselves. STEM students majorly works in technology company or technology related field. This is a need that simply U.S. citizen cannot satisfy. To work in this field one need at least to have a bachelor degree in U.S. majored in information technology. According to the statistics, there's only 30-40% U.S. citizen now in U.S. colleges major in IT related courses. If we don't allow the foreign students to work, all the company will face a serious problem of lacking qualified labor. They could not grow healthily and then finally reduce the number of employee they hire. At last the U.S. citizen could get even less opportunities. So for the sake of economy and U.S. own benefit, I support this rule
2. The U.S. education will also need OPT and STEM extension. One of the great advantage of U.S. education than other countries of attract foreign studens is OPT and STEM extension. For example, UK, Germany also have very good colleges, but none of them could match U.S. Why? Cause foreign student find getting more practice after graduation will be more useful for them. That's why U.S. students could compete with the smartest students from all over the world. That's why we could proudly said we have the best education system in the world. But if in the future this advantage disappear, what gonna happen to our education? Less and less students will like to go to U.S. and finally U.S. will lack our ability for competition.

For the sake of economy and education, I strongly support this new rule
