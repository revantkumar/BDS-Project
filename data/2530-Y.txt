I strongly support the extension of OPT.
1. Talent students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. And most of them just want some working experience before go back the home country and it won't affect American's job finding I think.
2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area.
3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
