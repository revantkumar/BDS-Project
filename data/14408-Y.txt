The OPT program should be shelved until new college grads can find jobs in there field of study. I presently know of three grads working part time. One as a construction laborer, another as a short order cook and the last as landscaper. That is not what I would consider proper utilization of a computer science, engineering and applied physics degree. It is time for Americans to come first.Thank you for your time J.W.
