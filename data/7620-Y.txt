Shahzad Bulsara Yes, I definitely do agree to this proposed extension for 24 months as it is beneficial to both the entities. As far as United States is concerned, it has always been a country which has been significantly inclined towards Science/ Technology and its development. This country has always been promoting and supporting potential innovators with learning resources as well as opportunities to prove oneself for serving many of the top leading companies which in turn help a nation's economy to grow, lead and be stronger.
Thus, this decision of extending the OPT period will not only welcome great minds graduated from good Universities in North America but also maintain the image of promoting education for future applicants globally. 
Thank you for this proposed opportunity.
