I fully support these rules. It is really gapping the need between the school courses and how the real industry world works with significant experience. Putting a stimulation on the education of students that is especially great for understanding how the school education really works on the industry. This is totally necessary for a student to be success in the their future career. The benefit of the policy to the US is significant, first of all, a diverse culture, when student's are working for the US companies, in fact US companies are benefit from the foreign culture. We always know that people from different culture have different view on same things, the diverse opinions will surely make sure that every activity and production in the industry is examined throughly and can target the world wide market more precisely. That is a strong bond to be success in the competitive world wide business, and with the success in the business, actually it means more jobs. This natural logic makes a lot of commons that addressing this policy will be bad for the us labor invalid.
