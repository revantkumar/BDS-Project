I am VERY opposed to this STEM proposal as it will basically decimate this field for our own college graduates. Here are some good points for NOT allowing this bill:

The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.
The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers.
Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.
OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.
Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.
OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.
OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.

I have grandchildren who are very hard-working students, very good in the science, math engineering field and I am VERY concerned that all the money they have spent on their education (with NO HELP from the government thank you) will be wasted and they will find themselves UNEMPLOYED thanks to their own government selling them out to FOREIGNERS.....this is ridiculous and NOT what a Federal Government should be doing. OUR workers should always come FIRST!
The people WE vote in should respect OUR wishes...not the wishes of BIG BUSINESS and the Chamber of Commerce....all they want is CHEAP labor....they DON'T care about the repercussions of their selfish actions and how it will destroy the middle class here in America. I am really annoyed that this bill is even being considered!
