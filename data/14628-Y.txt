The essence of the U.S to become the most successful nation in the world is its immigration policy that allows the most competitive individuals success in the U.S. Foreigners who can survive are not the group who can not make great contribution, but the elites have very strong technique background, since language is their weakness which is only can be complemented by skills. Employers' decisions are not based on whether an individual is foreigner or not, but whether he or she is capable to make job done. If there's any advantage that foreigner has over citizens, it must be that most of the foreigners are the group of people who are brilliant and working hard. They make businesses thriving and research advancing, so why refuse the chances to let these people to good to the U.S. And another point is that those who against this policy, please remember that you or your precedents are just immigrants like these newcomers. You leverage the benefit of loose immigration policy, then try to deprive the equal rights of others. What a shame for you guys!!
