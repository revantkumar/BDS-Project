Strongly support this proposal!!! This is American land , this is a free land!! If you wanna find a job, please working hard, learning hard and use your own ability to defeat those foreigners rather than deport them out of our country!! 
And we must be aware of the fact that many excellent foreigners do great contributes to our society, such as the CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella who was born in india and got his master's degree from U.S university !! In this fair and free land, every one has equal opportunities to achieve their goals. Don't forget about the American Dream, guys!!
Above all, I believe we wise Americans can understand the important of extension practice training ! If we cancel this extension, we may lose more opportunities!!
