Yaonan Huang I am totally supportive to extending the opt. I used to be on this status myself during the first couple months I worked for Microsoft, until I got my lottery of H1B, and officially begin my H1B status last October. OPT status gave me a chance to legally work at United States. During that period, I grew my skills as a software engineer.
