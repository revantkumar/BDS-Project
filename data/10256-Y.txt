Yu Jie I strongly support this proposal. I believe this proposal will benefit now and the future economic and technology development of United States.

United States has good welfare system and high salary level because this country has high economic system and advanced technology. Most of the advanced technology will use people with science, technology, Math and Engineering background. People with advanced degrees from this field is even more precious to be the main stream to help develop the technology and economy. a large portion of the students with advanced degrees in STEM field are foreigner students.

If united states don't give foreigner students a chance to work (by extending the opt work time), then it will lose the a huge amount of push effort from foreigner student with advanced degree from STEM background to make United States a better country for new technology and new companies. Fewer talented students will be attracted to come to united states to study.
