I strongly support improving and expanding OPT for stem graduates. F-1 students with STEM background are currently making great contribution to various industries in the US, especially in high-tech industry. And many of them are working with OPT extension status. Shutting down this extension policy will surely result in tons of international employers' losing working authority and therefore great loss to those companies who are hiring international employers. On the other hand, the new OPT extension policy will boost the possibilities of F-1 students' devoting themselves to the economic development in America.
