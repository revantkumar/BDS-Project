As an international student studying in USA, I agree to the new OPT extension rule.
First, working or creating a startup in my OPT duration is highly likely to bring about more job opportunities to American. International students are not just taking the job positions from American people but we are also generating new opportunities. Also, even with the OPT extension, it is still very hard for international student to work here. Compared to the international students, most small or local companies are more willing to hire American people. The positions left for international students are not that much. Last but not least, the one who gets higher education here should contribute to the American society. Thus, it should be a win-win rule for everybody.
