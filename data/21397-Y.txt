I think the extension of OPT is good for companies in US. Most F1 STEM students are highly efficient workers; they use their knowledge they learned from US universities to provide value for US. If they are not allowed to extend their OPT, US companies will suffer great economic loss. What's more, most F1 students are hard working and self disciplinary people, which means they won't bring any unstableness to the US society during their stay. So basically making F1 STEM students stay for more time in the US gives many benefits to the US and does no harm to her.
