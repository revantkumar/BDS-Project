Once upon a time, American dream was in everyone's heart, everyone who was on US soil regardless of his/her nationality, race or cultural background. Now people say American dream is dead and wonder who still believes in it. I do believe in it, and I believe thousands of foreign students who fly across oceans and continents to study in the US believe in it as well. It is true that the extension of the OPT might take away some US citizens' jobs but is it really that bad? And when did American people lose their confidence and are afraid of competitions? In my opinion, if American and foreigners who live in US wish to live in a stronger and better country, they have to look back in US history, it is the brilliant people coming from all over the world that make US the most powerful country in the world, not closing the border and try to live their own happy life. And when so many political candidates say they want to make a change to build a stronger nation, the first thing they need to do is to attract talents from the world but not refusing them. With a long-term vision and I believe everyone of us can understand this is true.
