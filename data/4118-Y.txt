Liang Xia It is extremely important that we support 24 month OPT extension for F1 students who really want to contribute what they learn from their schools to the US economy. Every year, our students earn their degrees in the US but lots of them can only work for a US company for a short time. We see our talented young people forced to return to their own countries because of the limitation of the original 12-month OPT period. Many of these people create startups in their own country instead of the US, contributing to their economies. The US is losing talents. We have to keep those talents in the US to make the America Great again!
