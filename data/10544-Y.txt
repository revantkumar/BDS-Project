I absolutely strongly SUPPORT the proposal with following reasons. Firstly, many ongoing scientific projects need to be done more than one year. If stem students are not allowed to get extension, the projects they are doing will be significantly affected. Some projects even take many years. With this fact, OPT extension should be 24 months or longer idealy. Second, Diversity is very important in the U.S.. Many global companies in U.S. tend to hire people with diversifies background, including disablity, venetian, female ect. Then why do they cannot hire international students with competitive skills? American society support opportunity equlity but why don't they allow international students working here longer? It seems unfair. Last but not the least, competition can increase improvement. No one can deny that international students with stem background are good at their study fields and big companies did hire many those good students as their employees or interns. And also no one can ignore that international students do contribute a lot to this society. If OPT extension is stopped, those companies will definitely get hurt and also their ability of competition. Americans who can find a good job absolutely do not care whether their competitors are from domestic or worldwide. Those who cannot are the ones who support cutting the extension. So why they do not first increase their skills?!
