I strongly support the rule. I demand the USA government to increase the OPT period to 5 years.

USA receives more than 40 billion from F1 students in many ways such as tuition fees, rents , groceries, taxes. which is GDP of USA states. 

F1 students creates jobs for Americans. They enable USA to move forwards.

US Government should provide green cards , H1B visas by default.

It is an open secret many H1B visas are acquired by service based IT companies such as TCS, Infosys, Syntel , CTS, Polaris. US government should restrict these companies. By these companies so many F1 students were not offered H1 B visas 

I demand US govt depriving the rights of F1 students is depriving the rights of American citizens.

US govt should propose a separate a rule that will give Green cards ,separate work permits without other competitors in this category. The work permits should be given for longer duration.

Many F1 students are under severe pressure about the H1B visas , green cards. I request US govt to make the process easier and smoother for F1 students to get the green cards and work permits.
