have discovered the low income family is out of work as You have Deprived them of summer work.
Reason:
It is because you want to please Obuma ! This long standing opposition to our kids working to help the family has disappeared.
You have lied to "We The People" Remember us this coming election day as we will be saying GoodBye to allot of you who have betrayed your office and the citizens of the United States. Is it worth your repartition? Is it worth loosing you source of Income? Is it worth loosing your "Inside Trading" ?
I should think not.
