No jobs for people here illegally or students, Americans citizens can not find jobs or jobs that pay enough to support their families. This just wants me to vote for no immigration and to deport all illegals. We don't need more people, the abortion industries kills more Americans each year that immigrate here. What is the government trying to do? Is it trying to replace the Americans who have here since the 1600, 1700, and 1800's, because that sure looks like what it is trying to do. No to anything for immigrants who by the way are suppose to be supported by a sponsor and not the welfare system, no to illegal immigrants and hell no to students trying to take our jobs.
