Proposed changes are well received and the additional cost is well justified. I support the changes. I would ask going further and making it easier for F-1 visa holders to work on ITAR projects funded by DoD. There is a shortage of PhDs and advance degree holders coming out of US colleagues with the right qualifications to do the work needed by the defense funded projects. There are just as many F-1 visa holders who are well qualified to do the work but it is very difficult for us to hire them due to ITAR restrictions.
