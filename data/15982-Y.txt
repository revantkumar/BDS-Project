I strongly support this policy and the reasons are listed below.

1. OPT(original 12+17months) plays a key role in attracting international students, espcially STEM students. As a STEM student, I have to admit that I chose to be educated in U.S., not only because the education quality here is better than other country, but also the OPT policy that allow us to apply what we learned to the real market. 

Real industrial experience, which obviously is more valuable than theorys learned from School. However 12 months is simply not enough to gain enough experience. Look at job requirements from companys," 2-3+ years working experience prefered". It typically take 2-3 years for a NCG to get faimily with how the company works. 

2. STEM students mostly work for high-tech compnay and the package/salary are decent. So the anti-opt organization's claim "OPT students are low-paid and thus massed up U.S. citizens job market" is apparently inapporiate.

3. STEM students, with high quality education background will definitely contribute to the development of U.S.

Thus, I strongly support this extenstion.
