I strongely support this rule for the following reasons:

As an International student, I choose to study in America because America can provide OPT extension after I graduate from university. I don't choose UK, Australia, Canada and so on, because we make use of OPT to get working experience in America. If We lose opt extension after graduation, We may not choose to study in America. We pay a lot of tuition fee to American University, I think if America stop opt program, America will lose this financial income every year in the future.

Second, we don't grab US citizens' job because of a lower salary. Sometimes, American work positions in stem field can't find a suitable US citizen to do , so American company need an International student to do these. If opt extension rule can be approved, America will attract more talent and smart and Intelligent International students to come to America. These talent and smart and Intelligent International students will make a lot contribution in American companies, and this rule will help to improve American competitive strength in the world directly.

Third, I will go back to China at last. However, I think 12 month regular+ 24 opt extension is a good length for an International student. Because it can benefit me to enhance my working experience overseas, and if I have three years working experience in American companies, it can enhance my competitive strength after I go back my country to find a good job. Sometimes, one program in American companies will last 3 or 4 years, so we need three years to practice. 

Therefore, I hope this rule can be approved as soon as possible, this rule will benefit to American economy finally.
