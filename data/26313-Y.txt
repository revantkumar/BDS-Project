I totally agree with this propose. Some people oppose this because they think international students are occupying their positions, but they need to know all employees are E-Verified employee, which they have no prejudgement for candidates based on their nationality, if they are citizen or not. They only chose people that they need most, and suitable most, so this is fair market, whenever this is market, there is competition, they have to accept this fact and strengthen them selves.
