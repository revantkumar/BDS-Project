Jane Moniot The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment and pure insult to American tech workers, their families and most especially recent college graduates. 

There are thousands of graduates holding student loan debt and a diploma with all the qualifications for a tech job who are not working at all, working part time or holding two fast food workers jobs to make ends meet....What do law makers not understand about the actual numbers of us Citizens who need your help in stopping the funnel of foreign workers who lawmakers are "gifting" their futures away from them?

This program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, all fields that are being pushed for US citizens to aspire to.

This proposal would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. 

To add insult to US workers, this program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. ALL Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers first, not against.
