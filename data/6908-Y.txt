I STRONGLY SUPPORT the extension.

From the perspective of a graduate student, the opt extension provided us with a good opportunity to make use of our talents and contribute to the fast developing technologies in the engineering fields in USA. USA stands for the top technologies and top talents in the world, hence this extension would definitely attract more talented people to come and make contributions to economy developing, technology revolution and culture improvement. This is in agreement with the aim when founding the United States of America.

Also for most negative claims, people were just complaining the policy rather than thinking about the real causes and improving themselves. The job market is naturally a competitive market. The reason people not hired is not because there are competitors with opt extension, but they haven't met the requirements of the companies hiring standard. Cancelling the opt extension would not help citizens get a job, but would also harm the developing of the companies and lead to a situation whether companies had few proper candidates to hire or they compromised to take non-skilled candidates and made a slow development or even push-back.

I hope the real voices are heard out of the endless complains and bad words.
