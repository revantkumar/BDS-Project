Rather than care about some intermediate "benefits" of forcing away foreign students to get the job, we should care more about the future of our country and therefore SUPPORT this OPT extension rule. 

First, think about why our country is rich and strong. To a large extent, it is due to the best group of experts in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. If we let international talent go, we lose a great driving force of our competitiveness. 

Second, think about why our country is attrative. One obvious reason is diversification. For the past hundreds of years, this country has been charming and energetic because it welcomes people of diversified background to join and build a future together. Don't lose this great traditional virtue. 

Last, some people complain that internatioal students took their opportunity. But we both know there are many reasons for unemployment. Attributing that only to international students is pointless.
