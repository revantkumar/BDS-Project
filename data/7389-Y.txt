Meng Chen I am a graduate student majored in Biostatistics. Though I love my major and have a strong hope to stay in the USA to donate for the public health field, being as a foreign student has been a huge problem for me to fulfill my dream. The USA is known as a country for dream, let's vote for STEM extention to help students like me to get a chance to perform our ability! Thanks!
