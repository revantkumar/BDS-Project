Being a STEM engineer myself and having seen both domestic and foreign students and engineers, I wonder why we don't encourage corporations to hire and train United States Citizens. How about making similar rules that employers must first try to hire/train US Citizens and show that they have tried before allowing foreign students to be hired or trained? Make the employers show cause why no US Citizen is qualified or can be trained to perform similar functions as the foreign student/employee. We have a responsibility to grow our own STEM capabilities before we encourage foreign employment in the United States. We do have adequate university and college programs, because the foreign students flock to the United States to get a superior education over what is available in their own countries. Set up programs to encourage corporations to educate our own citizens.
I was educated under Degree Completion program in the US Army, then went on to be employed in STEM position with Caltech/JPL for 20 years where Caltech paid for additional graduate degree programs. We can have our own citizens obtain education and be productive in society if we try.
