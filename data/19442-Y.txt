I strongly support the proposed rule of expanding OPT period for International STEM Students. As an international STEM student myself, I have seen so many US native STEM students who sucked at their major of studies at school still got fairly good job opportunities compared to the international students, all because of employers have set more restrictions on the foreign students and been afraid of their limited OPT period not fitting the span of the work. I don't believe that the expansion of OPT period will do any harm to the truly competitive US native students as they are already in favored in the job market.
