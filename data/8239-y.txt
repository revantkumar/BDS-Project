Christina Walker I strongly support this rule.

Most international students come to US for education mostly because of job opportunities. If the OPT extension is canceled , the chances of getting a job will significantly decrease. This will cause students not coming to the US for study. Most universities rely on large tuition collection from foreign students. They will lose a major source of revenue. Not to mention billions-dollars' incoming of US that is dependent on international students renting houses, cars, traveling, shopping, phones, tourism, etc.
