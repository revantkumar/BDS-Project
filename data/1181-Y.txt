I myself would definitely support this proposal to improve and expand OPT for F-1 students within the STEM system. Because foreign students holding OPT has always been and will keep being a very important supplement to the creative workforce in the USA society. Since the first day of his born, the American nation has always been a unique open nation that attracting outstanding people around all over the world to work here, to contribute making the greatness of this nation. That's one of the most distinctive essence of this country. Without it, US might not be the global leader US as it is now. 

On the other side, every year the US government and US universities spent lots of money and facilities to educate thousands and thousands of international students in the STEM system. By offering this training opportunity, the US government is actually proving a win-win solution to both benefit the US society and the students involved. It is also a very important factor that the US education system keep being the most vibrant one among its competitive colleagues around the world.

Some people might argue the extension of OPT can be a threaten to US citizens workforce. I don't agree with that. As a nation create itself by keep open and innovative, this nation never reject excellence. Should the Americans cease to advance in the fear of lose their competitions with new blood, or should the Americans take this new blood to make it stronger and force its self-upgrading? The answer is obvious.
