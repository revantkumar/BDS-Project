I am very disturbed to learn that the Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans

If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?

We absolutely must prioritize American workers and provide them with training if necessary, before we spend ONE DIME training foreign workers to take American jobs.

Foreign workers are cheaper for employers because they don't pay FICA or medicare taxes. These programs are insolvent already.

By expanding the program, DHS would be effectively establishing a shadow HB-1 program in violation of Congressional intent.

The American public is waking up to the reality of these programs which prioritize foreign workers over Americans, and we are getting angry. The president of the AFL-CIO agrees that these programs are harmful to the American worker. I urge that this rule change be rejected.
