US needs students from different culture, and so do lots of companies. Most of the foreign students in US take the stem degrees, which contributes to a large portion of the economic development of US. Only with longer time of OPT extension, the stem students can have enough time to do more contribution to the US. Also the new OPT can motivate more students to come to US for further studies, which will definitely improve the F1 program, and bring more to US.
