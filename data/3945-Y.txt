I appreciate DHS move to improve OPT rules for f1 students.due to very limited number of h1 slots for students graduating from US universities chance of getting h1 in one try is very low .all students came to US with the confidence of have 29 months opt but if the rule gets vacated we will all end up with Hugh debits.
