I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer science master student from China and am a software engineer intern at HBS System. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation,Our school has IPP(Industry Practice Program) that helps us better find internships and full-time jobs,I remember the day the company interview me,two white gentleman they strongly believe I can make great contribution to their company.
So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.
