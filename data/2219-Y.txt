I strongly support the extension OPT for STEM students. After several years studying in US, graduated students can definitely benefit the US economy and society if they are given chances. 

Most of the opposite comments shows that US citizens are afraid of losing job due to the extension of OPT. However, most companies will hire US citizens over international students. So international students will only fill in the positions that couldn't find a suitable US citizen to hire. Of course, it will increase the competition a little bit, but competition is what makes people, companies and even the US better. And also, OPT doesn't allow international students to get a job outside of tech industry. So for most of US citizens, people shouldn't be worrying about it.
