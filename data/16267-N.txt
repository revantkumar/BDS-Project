Today unemployed Americans in the United States exceed millions and many of them are technically trained who have been laid off by some of the high tech companies who hope to benefit from this action by the DHS. I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates and people who have been in the workforce but are now unemployed, struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
This action by DHS at the urging of our President without the approval of Congress is without a doubt a violation of the laws of our land and should not be allowed..
