I fully support this new rule. OPT is very important for foreign students to obtain experiences during working. Most of the foreign students are working on science and engineering, which greatly advance the progress of US as well as the whole world in science and technology. After OPT session, some of the excellent foreign students will get opportunity to obtain green card and stay at US, which is good for the economy increase of US. Please remember, the current advancement of US in the world is based on the cutting-edge science and technology. And besides, a lot of science projects last for two years or more, if there is only one-year OPT, it is impossible to complete most of the projects, which is a great loss for US companies. Therefore, it is crucial to extend OPT of STEM subjects by 2 years or more.
