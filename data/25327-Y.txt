As an asian graduate student from materials science and engineering department in UW Madison, I strongly support improving and expanding the OPT for STEM students.

I am searching for a job right now. It is really hard for a foreign student studying metals and alloys. Because most of the jobs are "sensitive" and only US citizens can apply. It is really hard to find a job within one year.

Though I can go back to my home country with my Ph.D degree, I have spent five years here. My boyfriend is here, my friends are here and my network is here. Also, I have developed a deep feeling with US. Why do not give students, like me, more opportunities to pursue our American dreams by extending the OPT?

Do you know how much efforts and money the government need to input to raise a skilled and knowledged STEM phd student? 6 years of primary school + 3 years of middle school + 3 years of high school + 4 years of undergraduate study + 5 to 6 years of graduate study = 22 years of school! Hope US government is smart enough to do its best to keep those brilliant people.

The companies will also be happy about the extension of the OPT. Suppose the company hired a perfect foreign STEM student and spent one year to train him. However, he is not lucky enough to be selected to obtain the H1b visa and he doesn't have enough time to try his chance again without the OPT extension. What a big loss the company will have!

In conclusion, I raise my both hands to support the extension of OPT for STEM students.
