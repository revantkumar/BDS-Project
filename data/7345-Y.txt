I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension. First, STEM are fields really critical for the US and foreign tech workers inspired innovation and contributed huge growth to the USA economy. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal. This amount of money is used in the welfare of all American people. Second, diversity made what the USA is today. Does not America ought to embrace all creative minds in the world? Is not this the foundation value of America?
