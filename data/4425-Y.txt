I strongly agree with the extention rules. It is not only because I am an international student but also it is necessary to apply the knowledge that we learned in the US to the US industry. It is not rare to see lots of international professors and scholars achieve great progress in the academic field as well. Some people worried about the competition from international workers. Well, competition exists but it is necessary for American to be stronger and better.
