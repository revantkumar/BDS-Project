I strongly support this rule!
This training opportunity should be tied up with our study opportunity. it's just a little more time for people to learn from each other. American people are always willing to learn advance skills from the world, but when you think you get the best result, it doesn't mean that you can not be better. all the international student in america has different education background, that means we think in different ways, and bring that thoughts into real work is what it's needed! new thoughts! that change things!
