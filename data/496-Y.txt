Cathy Xie If you are against this just because you think foreign STEM workers are a great threat to the local STEM workers, then you are absolutely wrong. Research has concluded that foreign STEM workers have helped increase the average wage for local STEM workers.Also, try to think about how many STEM students make up of the total STEM students in the U.S. colleges and universities, think about the loss of losing them all! 

Think about Google, Facebook and many other big companies which have huge number of foreign STEM employees. Think about how much these companies value each of their employees and think about what would happen to the super STEM industries when all the foreign STEM students are gone.

This is not only about you, this is about the whole industry, and the whole country. And why not think about this as a great chance as well a nice challenge for improving ourselves? We all know that no company favors foreign STEM workers for no reasons. 

If we are unable to take the challenge, then why talk about growing and a better life in the future? 

There are always a cost and a benefit. 
Try to think big!
