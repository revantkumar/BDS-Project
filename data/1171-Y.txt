Frank Fu The new OPT Extension STEM program is not only good for international students, but it is also good for U.S. economy. I understand that some of American may think that the new rule will make it even harder for American to find a job in certain industry. But U.S. high-tech companies are not stupid. In other word, they want hire the best candidates to make their business continued (if American candidate is much more competitive, they will still hire the right one ) rather than making this nation to be a seclusion. Benign competition in job market can improve the society.
