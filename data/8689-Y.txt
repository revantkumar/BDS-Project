Only a small amount high qualified students could find jobs within OPT period( even longer), how come OPT truly affects the US citizen's benefits overall? The thing is, students come to the US, spend one year doing entry level internship, and have to leave without a real job offer after a short period of working. Stockholders who really get hurt are local companies, who spend one year to train new graduates, and have to let them go without a valid visa. Historically American is a country with lots of immigration populations, and it will always be in the future. At least an OPT extension is better than open-door refugee policy to foster a multi-cultural business environment. To extent OPT will definitely have a positive effect to our society, and it is a better way to utilize education resources of the US.
