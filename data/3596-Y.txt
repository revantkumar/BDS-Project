I oppose your idea about Proposed OPT Expansion and I support the regulation for the following reasons:

1. You said there are more than 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties. I don't know where the data is but these people are not related to STEM foreign student. There is no apparent connections between international students and STEM Americans. What I know is, for STEM industry, there are always much demand than supply. International students doesn't occupy the position for US student. The US student always at first priority.

2. For american student who has student loan struggle to find work. Is this because of international student? Actually, many STEM students make our technology improve and provide much more jobs for us market. That is benefit for everyone. You can't view job position as a fix things. It is based on our economy.

3. stagnant market has many reasons, and you said foreign people occupy the market. Does this make market stagnant? I don't think so. The market has its own principles, you can't blame all this on foreign. Actually, more talent foreign make the market better and provide more jobs.
