Alvin Sleigh I strongly agree with the proposed rule. We have several reasons hiring international students who received higher degrees in U.S universities. First, with the rapid development of our company, our U.S. citizens dont meet our high demand for talented people any more. We need more good candidates to expand our business both domestically and internationally. Second, hiring international students improves the diversity a lot. Our statistics indicates that a team with high diversity has higher productivity. Last but not least, those international students in our company are doing so well that they are helping create more and more job opportunities for U.S. citizens. Considering that our company will have to face a great loss if these students working in our company have to leave U.S., please pass this proposed rule. Diversity and inclusion is why U.S. is still leading the world today.
