I really think improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 nonimmigrant students is a good idea.
First, it is good for employees to have some time to fit in the corporation and also good for employers to test if those F1 students are good enough for them and decide whether to grant them H1B or not later.
Second, it is also good for nature students since they are forced to improve themselves to hunt for a better job. It is a win-win situation.
