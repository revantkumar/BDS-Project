I strongly support this proposal because, despite a student may have interest to take the stem extension or not but the scope for those who wish to apply for this extension period to implement their knowledge practically and assess them selves their talent. Also this would be an encouragement to all the increasing number of international students coming for their masters or Doctoral programs to the country. We are very much looking for implementation of this proposal so that more and more students can learn and practically implement their learning's.
