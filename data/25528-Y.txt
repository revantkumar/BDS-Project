This is a very good initiative by the US government. I completely support this rule. F-1 students will have more time to get some training after graduating in their STEM fields. F-1 students of STEM fields obtains high level education from US. US has spent a lot of time and money developing their talents. Most of them wish to work here and contribute their considerable skills to the American economy. Also, the US society needs them to provide their talents. Companies prefer US citizens only when there is not qualified US citizen to do a job they choose F-1 student. Thus, F-1 students are not taking job opportunities from US citizens. Hence, I am hopeful of this decision to be approved.
