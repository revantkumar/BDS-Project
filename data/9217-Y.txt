I strongly support this role. A year of OPT is too short for many international talents, who could have impact on America's economy. Everyone knows that America is in a leading position in world's science and science and technology, but how could this happen? No one can deny that international talents contribute a lot. This rule will help more gifted students stay in America and make contribution to the society.
