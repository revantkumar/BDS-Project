I'm a potential international student and I strongly support the proposal of extending OPT to 24 months.
International students take up many jobs, but this is mostly because these companies can't find more suitable person. What's more, by contributing more for these companies, these international students could bring more economical benefits for the US, which then benefits citizens of the US. On the other hand, the atmosphere of fair and benign competition is very essential for improving the strength of the country, which could improve the average level of the students in the US.
