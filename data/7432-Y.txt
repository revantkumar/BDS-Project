"Education" being one of the business verticals of American economy with over 900k foreign students coming from around the globe to gain knowledge and understand the advanced system & technology that ultimately helps in evolving human race, I find this proposal necessary and mandatory to let the students pay their debts by providing them the opportunity to stay in states and gain some exposure at least for a few years which they deserve once they agree to spend themselves and stay away from their closed ones and lend a helping hand in order to make not just only US but the whole world a better place.
