Hao Zhang, Princeton University I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

STEM OPT extension provides America with an opportunity to appeal to talented international students, and STEM students would in turn make great contributions to this country. From my observation at Princeton University, STEM research are usually funded by NSF. These research achievements are important for future innovation. If STEM students are allowed to stay in the US, then they would be able to apply their knowledge and research to industry, and create even more jobs for the people in this country.

STEM students undertake the job that American students wouldn't usually take or be interested in, thus contributes to this country's economy. When both international students and American students are able to work on their specialized fields, America will become a better place for both of them.

America is famous for its diversity. Allowing international students OPT will enhance it's potential of creativity, and attract more talented international students. International students receive excellent American advanced education, and they are able to make use of their knowledge to contribute to this country. Imagine that if these brilliant international students are not attracted by the open-minded America, it would be a loss for this country.
