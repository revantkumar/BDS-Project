I am an F-1 Student, master of Computer Science. I just graduated, and work in Google, front-end engineer. But I still need to apply for H1B, and the rate is only 60%, if I missed that, I will back to China. But most of the front-end and web developer are new graduate F-1 OPT students. If the program cannot be extended, many of the developers will back to home and nobody can do our job. Because only Chinese and India student can code well, and only us want to be programmer. Without us, Google, Amazon, eBay will dead in no time. We help U.S web's companies being stronger, we did not let anybody lose their job, but we helped many companies to open more job, because we help them to make more money. Thanks a lot!
