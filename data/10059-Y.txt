I support this proposal.

Actually this proposal has no influence on me since I am a MBA student. I write this comment for I disagree with some other comment like "steal jobs", which is definitely not the truth.

The extention is only for STEM, the major that very little Americans willing to study and many technology companies found difficult to find employees. the extension definitely will not steal Americans jobs. The extension can also help the development of these technology companies.

For other major, like my major there is no extension since Americans are willing to study in these fields.

All in all, in my opinion, the proposal is benefit for both American technology companies and the STEM student.
