I strongly support this extension. It is the diversity that makes US the greatest country in the world. In science, we have a similar concept called entropy. High entropy means more uncertainty, and it is in these uncertainty that innovation and creativity grows. Sending every stem students back home after they finish their degree will be proved short-sighted since this will reduce the entropy in the American Job market.
We all agree that our universities are the best in the world. And of course the graduates from these universities are the best as well. Why send these people home while they can be proved more valuable and create more wealth here on American soil? It is our honor to have the best people from their own home country and it does more good to us if they stay.
