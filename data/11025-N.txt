Explain to me why you want to bring foreign workers into America when we have such a shortage of jobs. When employers have to kick Americans out of work so the foreigners can have jobs then it is obvious that there are not enough jobs to go around. May I remind you that as an employee of the American taxpayers you are responsible for taking our needs into consideration before anyone elses.
