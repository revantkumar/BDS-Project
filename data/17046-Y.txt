I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because we can keep more well educated and trained people in our country if this proposal is passed. In the 21st century, people with special skills or knowledge are really important to any country. With more such people, we will have better economics and further we will have more opening jobs, because these people will help our country to earn more money from other countries.
