Zhiyong Yang, Tongji University I'm an undergradaute student from Shanghai and right now applying for a graduate school of America, whreas most of my fellow students are applying for the universities in Germany. They don't understand with such a high tuition why I still choose to go to America. 'Cause it is known that the Unis in 
Germany charge nothing from the students. I told them when I got the Master Degree, there would be a 12-month-opt and probably a 17-month-opt-extension lying ahead of me. With the nearly 3-year full time working experience in America it's not hard for me to get an ideal job when I come back China. However, you don't even have access to an internship in Germany,let alone working experience.
Ironically, it would be their turn to laugh at me if the opt-extension were to be cancelled. A merely 1-year working experience can't be regarded as having working exxperience in China. Morever,emplyees can only get a general understanding and basic training of the company's function process within 1 year. When you are matured enough to undertake something for your boss and make profits for the company,it's your turn to leave America. Therefore, I'm thinking about applying for a university in Germany. At least there's no tuition there. If the new opt-extension can't be passed, a lot of potential international students for America will be robbed of by Germany, France and even Japan.The consequential effects to America's education system, technology industry and national economy will be fatal. Please let it pass and make America great again.
