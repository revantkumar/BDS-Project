This proposal will definitely fuel the long-term success of US. Historically, it is undeniable that foreign workers in STEM areas have contributed a lot to the high-tech industry which has created even more job openings over last several decades. It is actually a win-win scenario rather than a zero-sum game. Please pass this proposal not only for foreign STEM students, but also for US economy in long term!!!
