I am supporting this rule with all my heart.

1. As we all knows, US has been the ideal country for high tech immigrant for the past 50 years. From the first nuclear bomb, first computer to the tech giants today like Google and Apple. The contribution from immigrants, especially from STEM students can't be ignored. To embrace the talented people with strong academic background and make them part of the country, this is how America keeps being the country with leading technology. 

2. Also, lots of STEM students finally become permanent residents or U.S. citizen. A majority of them will make their own business. By doing this, they will creating more jobs for local residents and government, not to mention the tax contribution for the federal and local government. 

Great movement to support.
