I am a graduate student in bioengineering and I strongly support this rule because actually it will benefit to not only America but also the world. 
We all know America has the most advanced technologies in many fields and it is undeniable that thousands of talented international students contribute to them a lot. This rule will definitely attract more brilliant young people from all over the world to study in U.S., which will become an opportunity to not only promote the technological progress of America but also show the demeanour of a big country. 
In addition, the best way to relieve the stress of job market is to create more positions, which is more likely to achieve under an open conditions. Blind limitation and restriction to international students will finally have negative effects on the economic development of America. 
Lastly, it is American spirit to give everyone equal chance. Many international students spend so many efforts and money studying in America, so we should be given more time and chance to practice our skills and gain some work experience before we leave America.
