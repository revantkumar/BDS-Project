I am a recent graduate from the PhD program in statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The past five years in graduate school has been very rewarding and valuable to me. Here I want to advocate for the OPT stem extension. 

First, most americans are not that interested in mathematics. There are so few American students in my department. Furthermore, I worked as a teaching assistant for statistics courses for five years. I can really tell those American undergraduates only select the course because it is required for their major. They only come to my discussion session because it would help them finish their homework. My students couldn't understand at all why I would choose statistics as my major.

Second, I want to share my recent job hunting experience. Foreigners have to be much better in order to compete with natives at the same job. And we are often payed lower than the US citizens. If the employers have a choice, they will always choose an American.

So my point is that I don't see how the extension wouldn't benefit the US economy, since it brings excellent and cheap working labor.
