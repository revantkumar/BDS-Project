I would encourage the U.S. Government not to open more opportunities for foreign exchange students to take away the tech
school and higher education opportunities from the millions of young people and middle aged people here in America that need
the same education and work opportunities.
We need to give education and work opportunities for our own people. Then and only then do we open opportunities to others. 
For too many years our government has ignored the depleting educational needs of our own people. Our own young people
need training, education and work.
