NEHAL VISAVADIYA I strongly support this proposed 24 month STEM OPT extension rule.International student and STEM Graduate wants this rule to be implemented and it's gonna affect thousand of student who came here for higher degrees and they highly skilled with technology , currently big companies likhave CEO who are from India. Most of the student are coming here for MS in Engineering and Science Department , they are more interested in STEM area so Economy is also stable just because more STEM Students are coming and by blocking this jobs it will simply hurts the companies who are rely on eligible job.Students are coming from F-1 visa eventually become Green card holder then citizen . this is benefited in American Economy. most of student come here because Job opportunities are good here. this will simply lead to students not coming to US for Study and Various universities that rely on large tuition collection from foreign nationals will lose a major source of revenue. some of the universities is gonna shut down and so again unemployment is gonna increase. million dollars economy that relies on international students for renting house,cars,travel,shopping,phones,buying cars,tourism economy when parents and relatives visit America.
