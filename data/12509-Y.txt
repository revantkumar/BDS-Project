I strongly agree with this Rule.

First, you should see the contributions that F-1 students has made to the whole society in recent years. Most of the F-1 students are well-educated, especially the Masters and PhDs, they can be valuable resoueces towards US. An extension of Training time means a more comprehensive training and more time to contribute, which is good for both the F-1 students and the society. 

Although we should admit that such a regularization may lead to more competitions in seeking a job. But the thing is, don't you want to achieve a fast development speed? With the process of globalization, it's beneficial for US to maintain some competitious atmosphere.
