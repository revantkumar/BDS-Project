I am strongly agree to the proposal. The STEM students are majorly working in the technical industry especially in engineering field that involves heavy engineering practice and scientific training. There has been reported with gaps for jobs in these fields with relatively less citizens interest for them. High speed emerging IT firms for instance, though making a huge amount of money contributing a lot to the GDP in recent years, are thirst for talented young people with innovation, passion and work enthusiasm. However, the heavy work load is the major concern of senior citizens to work there. At the same time, young citizens could not satisfy the demand of these companies. In order to make up for these jobs, we do need international students, which has already making great portion of contribution to the field, to be involved and stay for long. The current period for OPT is relatively short for them to obtain H1B in the recent years as the waiting time gets longer. To keep them in the position, we do need some more efforts to help them stay long. This proposal is necessary by all means.
