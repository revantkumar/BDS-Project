John Saxton There is no reason to Improve and Expand Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and
CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. We already import too much labor. We allow US based companies to layoff
American citizens so they can offshore the job or import someone who will work for less because they want a green card.
This is a short sighted and dangerous practice. 

At the same time that our government is allowing and encouraging firms to import abor so that American workers can be
replaced by imported labor, we are trying to encourage our children to earn degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Math. Imagine being the child of a parent who has an advanced degree in one of these disciplines, but was replaced by
imported labor. If you are a child who sees your parents with advanced STEM degrees suffer due to the short sighted policy
of their own government, are you likely chase an advanced degree in a STEM discipline? If you are that parent, are you
going to encourage your child to pursue that degree? Doubtful in both cases. 

Smarten up. American Citizens first. When we achieve full employment, then we can think about importing labor. Until then
lets concentrate on keeping American's employed and lets concentrate on educating our children to meet the future needs
of this great country.
