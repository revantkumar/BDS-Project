Our international students, getting away from home, stepping out of the comfort zone, to pursue further education. We struggle to survive in foreign country, not just live but to thrive. people have no rights to decide where they were born. That's to say the educational opportunity, work opportunity and science are created without boundary. What the society needs are people, people who are skilled, people who are talent, people who are intelligent. There is no set for different nationality. I support extension of OPT. To not stop ongoing projects, to globally improve workplaces, to thrive all human beings in the world.
