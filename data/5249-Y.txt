I SUPPORT THIS.

As a opt student, I stay employed, i work hard, i pay federal and state taxes, my company pays medical insurances, i contribute to my team and my company. I don't take anything for granted. I contribute to the US society, I do volunteer jobs, I donate to my school, I buy girl scout cookies. Some of the comments really does not make sense.
