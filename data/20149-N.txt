The ONLY people that this helps are BIG Corperations and NON Citezens. NOT the Average American. Please don't do this. It makes no sense. It's funny I'm Begging A US Agency to help Americans. How sad that Americans that lead this agency don't see this as a problem. 
I LIVE her in the Bay Area. The heart of the Silicon Valley. There are PLENTY of Americans to do the work, BUT, The Tech companies take advantage of the immigration laws and fire Americans making 70k a year, pay 10k for a worker visa and then pay the worker 40k a year. A 20k savings per employee they can essentially outsource!!!!The ONLY reason this has not been stopped HAS to be because of corrupt officials. This is the ONLY thing I can think of. Why a fellow American can say that MORE foreign workers is a very good idea for America.
