How can a foreign student with a STEM degree from a qualifying institution be anything but good? The new proposed STEM extension rule signifies that US opens to globalization and embraces talents from all over the world. It's a way that US maintains its paralleled competitiveness in the global market. I don't see opposing this rule will benefit US in any way. On the other hand, it will eventually hurt US economy in a long term. Therefore, I support this new proposal.
