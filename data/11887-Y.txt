I strongly support this new rule. I am an international master student, majoring in math and statistics science. Before I came to US, I had multiple choices to chase my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason for I choose to study here is that US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I don't think US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and many of us probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents.
