I completely support the Stem Extension!!

United States has always been looked upon as a role model for developing countries across the world. Many countries measure their economic status with United States economy as a bench mark. To achieve such a status in the world today is no joke and it is because of the contribution of the people in the country. United States has always welcomed the wide talent pool of immigrants and provided a field for research and development. This has led to a lot of ground breaking achievements in the world. Providing such opportunities has not only led to the self development of the people but also to the economy of the country and also helping humans to lead a better and healthier life.

Any research or projects do take time to complete and this extension completely makes sense.
