PRITESHKUMAR MAHAJAN Expanding OPT extension will help USA to keep talented people to achieve higher economic growth of USA.
More students will come to USA for higher quality education which every nation needs nowadays.

USA stands first rank in education all over the world and I totally support this. 

It would be more better if we will get extension which will be very valuable to gaining quality work experience for international students to help their nations to achieve growth of their country as well as USA.
