I support 36-months OPT for STEM degrees international students, because it is a win-win strategy for both U.S. employers and international students. U.S. employers will have a broader worker profile and can hire employees without worrying about their visa status. It also provides plenty of time of their work authorizations after graduation of international students, as most of them are strongly skilled candidate in many research-related professions.
