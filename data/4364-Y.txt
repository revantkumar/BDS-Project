Ziman Zhou I advocate this proposal. The longer STEM extension would allow those who have the STEM skill sets to work in the US without much concern about the timing, and this will potentially lead to more devotion and productivity. Meanwhile, for the US companies, it would be less costly to hire and train the new employees with F-1 status where there would be at least two years of guaranteed employment without having to transfer to the H1B visa. This will be a win-win situation benefiting both the F-1 students and the US industries.
