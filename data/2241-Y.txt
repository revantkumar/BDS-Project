Giving international students the opportunity to stay longer makes possible a longer and deeper exposure to the US way of doing things. As a result, when they go back to their home country, they'll be able to cooperate and communicate with US companies better than their domestic peers. This obviously benefits US companies and organizations. Sending international students back home right after graduation benefits no one.

Also, it might be helpful if data can be provided regarding the lack of engineering talents in certain high-tech fields. Showing that such shortage of talents can not be eliminated without allowing international STEM students to help for a longer time might make a good point.
