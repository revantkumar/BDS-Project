I strongly support this proposed rule to be passed so that STEP students can get another 24 months of chance to work in the US.
I support this because of the following two reasons:
(1) Diversity
US firms emphasize a lot of company diversity. Having international students working in the firm will definitely help the firm reaching the goal of embracing diversity.
(2) Economic Factor
Currently, many STEM students work in US firms, not only in the tech space, but also in finance, consulting and engineering spaces, etc. By supporting STEM students to get another 24 months work in the US, US economy will not get deteriorated due to the sudden shortage of STEM students.

Thus, I strongly support the rule to be passed.
