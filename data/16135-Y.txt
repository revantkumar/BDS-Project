Hi, I strongly support this rule on improving and expanding OPT. Here are my reasons.

First, most part of native students would not like to study in STEM field, and a lot of them refuse pursing higher degree, like MS or PhD. However, a huge number of openings are needed in STEM. So the growing STEM market needs foreign workers to fill the talent shortage. And the STEM student is a perfect match for this issue. We have received professional education and had higher degree, even had several years experience. 

Second, a long term of OPT is a big reason for that many foreign students choose the States to go on their study. If the OPT EXT is cancelled, the number of oversea students undoubtedly will decrease badly. The income of many universities and the related government tax will be influenced seriously. 

Last but not least, many foreign students in STEM has been working in companies by using their OPT. Although the current rule will stay alive until February 2016, it still is an apocalypse for STEM OPT students. If the cancellation of STEM OPT happened, a very big laying off would began. It will cause an earthquake in the industry.

I sincerely hope this rule can come into effect.

Thank you
