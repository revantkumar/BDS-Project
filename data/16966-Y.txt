I would not choose USA for my college if there is no OPT extension.

The reason I came to America and pay large amount of money for my college degree is that I could practice what I have learnt in my jobs. And just one year is certainly not enough. I would raise all my hands to support OPT extension. 

If the OPT extension is canceled, I think all my student friends would choose other countries afterwards.

So I SUPPORT OPT EXTENSION!
