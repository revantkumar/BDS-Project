I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1.As an international student in US, I learned knowledge from U.S. university and hope to contribute to the country. Obviously, the knowledge would be better applied to where it is from. Additionally, hiring international students smooths and speeds up trade among countries without cultural conflicts and misunderstandings. 
2.Some of my friends gave up their offers from top universities in U.K. and came to U.S. It is not only because universities in U.S. have high standards of teaching and advanced laboratories, but also because U.S. has a friendly policy for international students, i.e. extension for OPT. Losing this advantage, I believe most students would hesitate over their choices of coming to America.
3.Honestly, I do think many international students plan to return to their home country after several years in U.S. It is important to gain the working experience in the U.S. before we return back to our countries. Without the working experience in the U.S., we lose a competitive strength comparing to other employees when we return to our countries. Several years working in the U.S. we may consider return back to find a better occupation in our own counties. There is no worrying about occupying job positions for U.S. citizens since some of us may not want to stay in U.S. permanently.
