Dennis Walker I strongly support this 24 month extension for STEM training. I am working in a huge tech company and have many colleagues who is on OPT. They are intelligent, hardworking and nice people. They have been contributing to our country so much. We should do favor to these foreign students and employees who loves our country and are contributing to our country. Offering them OPT extension will only do good to our economy and let them continue to work for US corps. Terminating their work eligibility will pose instant hardship to themselves and US companies. They are not illegal immigrants nor refugees from Mideast, no reason to dislike them.
