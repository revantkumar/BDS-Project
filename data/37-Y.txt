Im currently a F-1 student and plan to graduate next June. I have to say OPT extension is crucial to all international students in US. It at least give us a chance to compete with local students. When I'm finding a job, the most frequent question I'm asked is not about the position itself but whether I'll need H1B sponsor. With OPT extension, I can at least beg one company to give me a chance since HIB requirement is not that urgent. However, if the extension is gone, companies will be under great risk hiring international students since it's unsure whether these students can still stay in the company next year. 
Every year the number of students coming to US for study is continuously growing, which boosts education income and local economics. When we arrived this land, we was told about the freedom, the American dream. We must work harder than others just for a fair opportunity. We always believe that any effort will has its rewards. However, if OPT extension is canceled, I can imagine that thousands of will loose their job and more than thousands of students planning to go study in US will change their mind. I truly don't want it happen.
