I strongly oppose the extension of this program. I've been a grad student and faculty member, and have seen the misuse of this program from both sides. Students who do not and should not need "internships" with professional degrees attempted to use OPT in order to stay here longer and take jobs from Americans. OPT deprives AMERICANS of opportunities and because of the financial incentives to hire "students" on OPT, Americans are at a disadvantage in getting STEM jobs. Foreign students come here on NON immigrant visas with the express requirement that they intend to return to their home countries to use the education they gained here. This extension makes a mockery of that.
