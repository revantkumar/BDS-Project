Strongly agree. The country will benefit from this proposed rule. 

With OPT extension, universities and colleges which offer STEM degrees will be more attractive to foreign students. More students will be willing to pay tuition to get a chance to have a STEM degrees from these institutes, and these institutes therefore will have more funding to develop their education resources, bring better education quality to the public.

Students who graduate with STEM degrees can have more time to work at U.S. before getting an H1B, and contribute what they have learned from U.S. universities back to U.S. society. 

STEM related industries can benefit from hiring OPT students. Currently, talents shortage problem is serious in STEM industries, especially the IT industry. The industry is growing dramatically and demands talents. While there is no enough American talents in STEM, allowing more OPT students to enter the job market eases the pain of talents shortage and helps the industry to grow. 

This proposed rule may affect the American employment in STEM industries, however, it is not a zero-sum game. The previous OPT extension with 17 months had been effective for years, but the STEM skills shortage is not eased. Even if the OPT extension is canceled, the STEM talent shortage problem in U.S. will not be resolved by hiring more native STEM talents, since the number native STEM talents is big enough to fill the gap. With OPT extension, STEM industries will be able to grow more healthily, and create more job opportunities in the future.
