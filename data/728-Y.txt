I support the OPT extension. 

I don't think international student get job because of their low pay. Most students are qualified and educated. Company will not hire a unqualified student even they require a low pay, it will bring a large cost of the company. On the contrary, most international students work as a data analyst or software developer. These jobs provide a large amount of position and lots of local people will not want to do.
