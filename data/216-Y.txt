I would not argue with people that some of nonimmigrant students are planning to obtain green card in the path of their employment. It is clear to everyone that US are attracting the most talented and hardworking students from all over the world, and are benefiting from their contributions. Those STEM students who could have contributed to the economics and society of their own countries highly treasure the working environment provided by American companies, especially high tech ones. Every year, those companies also recruit a lot non-immigration students trained by US universities to fulfill its needs of talents, which clearly can not be easily fulfilled only by its residents. 

As a non-immigrant STEM F1 PhD student in the area of information science and technology, I am always open to positions from industry as well as academics. My research and skills can help me find positions in both areas all over the world after graduation, and I am believing US companies and US universities are often of high interest to me. However, it is surprising to me that those policies for STEM OPT students is so restrictive, meanwhile hardly acknowledged by some American residents. I will live with any decisions made by the federal, but it is your chance to know how US became the largest economic body and built the largest technological society in the world after the World War II.
