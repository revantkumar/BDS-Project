I fully support this rule as it helps the economy, future prospective immigrants, helps the country retain top talent continuing to keep US an attractive destination for skilled talent. In addition to STEM candidates from US universities I would urge the rule to expand or in a future revision include MBA Candidates with a STEM focus or working in STEM field in the US to be covered by the rule as well.
