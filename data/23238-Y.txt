There is a shortage of stem jobs, and training that relates to technology in demand. There isn't a shortage of stem workers.
I have a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from a top 5 engineering college where I was on the Dean's list, 
but I am working outside my field. Mechanical engineering employment is connected to manufacturing, which has been waning
for decades. There are many former engineers whose careers come to an end because of lack of demand for the skills in their trained professions.
Retraining programs need to be made available to displaced engineers. These stem workers have the proven ability to acquire technical skills in demand by companies. Training in current programming languages 
is one example of how domestic stem workers could regain employment in a technology.
There are an estimated 345,000 US born engineers who are unemployed. That is not a shortage of available stem workers.
