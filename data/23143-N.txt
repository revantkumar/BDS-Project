Do not expand this program. Give back jobs to the MILLIONS of Americans who are in IT jobs. IT jobs include mid-Technical and low-Technical jobs that any intelligent high school graduate could do. Do not give away millions of jobs to millions of foreign workers as we are now doing.

Let us lower the Welfare population in this country from 47.5 million where it really is today, BACK to the 17.5 million where it was 15 years ago, before all this new and expanded labor dumping practice started, out of sight of the American voter.

BRING BACK DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. Stop the sneaking.
