As a former international student at Massachusetts, I strongly support the OPT extension proposal with the following reasons:

Firstly, this will attract more international students to US to study, rather than go to european universities, which will make the universities at US more competitive and pluralistic.

Secondly, during the OPT extension period, companies at US could could employ more international students to expend their business and technique, and pay more tax to the government.

Thirdly, international student usually rent apartments near their universities, which could improve the revenue of the landlord. What's more, international student will spend more in US if they have more OPT duration in US, which will improve the US's economic.

In sum, extending OPT period will benefit the US in many aspects, and attract more students to the US.
