John Fink We are importing refugees from Syria, why not the guys with US STEM degrees, OPT Extension is not for immigrant propose, it is good to give these guys opportunities to work for US. They are a big portion in the graduate schools and they published a lot of research papers. They are making America's economy better, more top students want to study in the US because there are a lot of opportunities out there, this is a win-win policy, we need them and they need our government to give them more opportunities, so the STEM OPT extension is good for both international students and the United States.
