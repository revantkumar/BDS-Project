Xiaohui Wang I strongly support for this proposed rule for the following reasons.

1. This rule provides a huge advantage to academic institutions in US to attract excellent international students. Without this rule, lots of foreign talents would change to pursue advance degrees in other countries. A lot of STEM related industries rely on these foreign talents to make contributions to the company and the country. 

2. The 24 months extension makes sense because many projects in STEM fields require a long period of time to complete the whole process. Students involved with these projects should be encouraged to contribute a deeper understanding of their filed and develop advanced skills to improve the industry. 

3. There are thousands of students who are working with OPT extension status right now, if this proposed rules is not approved, all of them are falling into an illegal status and will be forced to leave US. If this happens, this could be a huge blow to several industries in US, especially the IT field. This would be a bad thing for the US economy.
