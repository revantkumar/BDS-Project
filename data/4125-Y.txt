This new policy is really good for STEM international students, US universities and the whole US economic.

First of all, for STEM international students, they have more time to practice their skill in real US industry rather than just go home. Especially for students who are majoring in computer science, having working experience in silicon valley is a great plus for their future career path.

For US universities, this new OPT STEM extension policy will definitely attract more international talent students. There is no doubt that US needs more talents from all over the world.

STEM industry is a significant part of the US economic, and we do need more excellent engineers and researchers to keep the US growing fast.
