I strongly support this rule!! I'm an international STEM student working with my OPT now. In my company, I met a lot of talented, creative and hard-working engineers at my age. But we are experiencing the same problem that if we couldn't get H1B before OPT expired, we have to leave United States. I think it would be a huge loss to the company even to the industry, if so many excellent people go away. Eventually, it leads to negative impact on economy of the whole country!! Native STEM graduates in the US alone are not enough to support the economy growth.
