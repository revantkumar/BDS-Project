After two days thinking, I got a even stronger feeling that US will benefit from extend OPT extension to 24 months. US consist of varied kind of people, each kind of people plays a important role in this country. All of us contribute to the growing of America, if our international tech people can have this 24 month extension, we would be more concentrated on our duty and "act" better. So I strongly support extend OPT extension.
