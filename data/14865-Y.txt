Most of H1B holders now do NOT get their VISA through the F1-OPT-H1B process: the majority of H1B applications are filed by consultant companies for people who do NOT have a USA college degree. OPT is only applied to foreign students who have received education here. Without sufficient OPT length lots of them will lose the opportunity landing a job here. Do you think those job vacancies will eventually fall into the hands of you/your children? No! Eventually they will be taken by other immigrants who never joined your school because companies will still need to hire so many people. Now, between the two inevitable results which one will you choose? To help those who pay tuition to your country and later try to utilize what they have learned here to make America stronger together with you, or to let people who have paid you nothing but still will be here because of the needs must be met take the opportunity?
This regulation is only TRYing to help OPT holders but NOT guaranteeing them job opportunities. They will still have to leave America if they can not find a job here. During their job hunting, they are spending their own money not earned from you but from their own people and thus in fact making positive effects to your local economy. After they are hired by an American company, they pay taxes just like you and me. These people believe the American Dream and they have not only paid for it but also worked out for it. It is thoughtful and justifiable to help them.
By instinct we do not like "change"s because by human nature a "change" usually sounds dangerous and uncomfortable to us. But a change is not necessarily bad if by not allowing it worse changes can follow in. I agree with this regulation for its pragmatic purpose.
