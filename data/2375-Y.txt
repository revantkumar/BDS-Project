I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Competition does exist among international students and US citizens, but it is not a bad thing! What's more, many jobs positions cannot find enough US citizens to do the job. If some international students are really excellent, why stop them from working for US? They are contributing their knowledge to the prosperity of THIS country.

Diversity is very important for the U.S and this country is famous for its diversity. Please be opening minded on this opt extension as you always were.

Overall, the OPT extension will benefits the development of US for sure. No one wants to see that US loses its competition because of the loss of vast excellent engineers!
