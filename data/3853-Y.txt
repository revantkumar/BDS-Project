Naga Raghuveer Modala I graduated with PhD degree in Dec 2014. I support this 24 month STEM OPT extension and I feel that only students from accredited universities can apply for STEM OPT is a very good decision and it can help to eliminate lot of unqualified students. The only concern is the increase in the paper work (Form I-910). It would be better if the information on the form I-910 can be reduced (Mainly in section 5).
