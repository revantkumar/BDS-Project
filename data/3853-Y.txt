I strongly support the opt extension for the following reasons:

1. It is extremely smart to give international students the extension working with their knowledge/tech after they receive professional training in this country. They like to work in United States because of the justice, freedom and creative spirit of the US society. Why would US government refuse the contribution from the young men who share the same belief with the nation? Why would US government reject their working extension after spending years of professional training on them? That totally does not make sense! The best win-win situation is that the international students get benefit from the excellent working environment and the US not only gets benefit from the wealth created by these brilliant brains, but also receive a significantly strong power of supporters in the near future. 

2. Think about how mach tax the international students pay. Then think about how much they can pay more if the extension is approved. They proved themselves and helped to shape and improve the nation with their intelligence and TAX! The wealth and contribution they have made help to improve the education, health care, tech innovation, public service and even military power of the US. They are helping!

3. It is ridiculous to say international students take away citizens' job position! For those citizens without jobs. How many of them are able to do a job in STEM discipline? How many are capable to replace the masters or PhDs graduated from US universities? For those people, how is it helpful to cancel the extension? On the other hand, many international students create multiple job openings by building their own career in US. They are helping to solve the problem!
