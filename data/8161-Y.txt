Who the hell do they think they are?!!! Without their ancestors being immigrants in this country they wouldn't have existed! Have you ever seen such a bunch of self-righteous arse-covering prigs, organizing themselves like zombies to post obviously biased, unfair and ridiculously unjustifiable comments on the new STEM OPT Extension proposal, and to make selfish, narrow-minded and misleading definitions of Americans and the labor market? Gosh every time there is a democratic reform there are always a brood of ignorant, lazy, incompetent and coward folks being the first to stand against it. They don't really care about the proposal itself, the only thing they care is protecting their clumsy work styles and unenterprising spirits, which they regard as their future!
