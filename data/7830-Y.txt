US is transitioning into a economy where Information Technology industry is leading entire country. Especially after manufacturing is clearly no longer the driver force behind economy growth. If US does not work hard to keep young talents who drives technology industry striving and running, US is surely going to miss best growing opportunity available to human race within this century. 

Optional Practical Training is an important phase all immigrant young talents who graduate from top US universities go through to obtain job opportunity. Without STEM degree extension and Cap-Gap relief, a large portion of them would not have enough time to finish the process of securing work opportunity. What is even more scary is the policy has a heavy impact on mindset of these talents. A diminishing opportunity may change their decisions. Collectively, their decisions determine tech industry.

No doubt, US, especially Silicon Valley is one of the dream places in entire world for tech talents want to work in. This is a valuable resource for US to take advantage of. Barring these talents outside by closing the door of OPT is blindly abandoning this value resource. If policies like this were implemented, soon Silicon Valley will migrate to other countries where young tech talents choose to live.
