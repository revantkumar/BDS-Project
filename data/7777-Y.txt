Sachin Bhandarkar Dear DHS/USCIS,

I completely support this proposed rule. I personally believe that international students educated in the US are very resourceful to the US industries even as they gain experience through practical training. It is important to provide good opportunities to students educated in the US, such that the country can selectively retain the talent it requires to maintain global supremacy in STEM as well as other fields. 

To address the comments which mention about students taking away jobs from American citizens, I would like to remind them that OPT/STEM OPT is just a Work Authorization. Students still need to consistently prove their skills and mettle in order to get jobs in their field of education. From my personal experience, I felt that equally or better skilled American citizens are always preferred over non-immigrants for any job. 

Once again, I really appreciate this rule and would like to see it as a Final rule.
