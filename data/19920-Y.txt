I support the decision of expanding the OPT extension to 24 months. STEM students and their talented ideas contribute to the development of economy, technology and research institutions. They are educated here, doesn't it mean we kick the advanced, expensive professional knowledge and education out of US? If they can't stay here working and giving back to the big companies as well as education institutions.
