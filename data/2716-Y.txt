Sir,

This is the letter from me is regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate international student from University of Illinois. Majority of Graduate students from this university are international students on F-1 visa. All these students will be strongly affected by proposed stem rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

I am already in Stem opt work permit and I am glad I was given opportunity to work here to improve my skills and serve my very best to some biggest IT companies. OPT and OPT Stem Extension work permit is important due to following reasons

1. This is the only opportunity an international student gets to improve their skills and apply all the knowledge we have gained from our studies in real world which is literally impossible to do back in our countries as their we don't find that opportunity provided to new graduates.
2. USA will be benefiting from these international students as we will be filling the shortage of stem graduates required by industries here.
3. Its beneficial to Government to as we will be paying taxes and spending our money for living which will indirectly generates good number jobs for american citizens.

Many other benefits, So I am glad and thankful if you have read this message and will be very thankful to you from me and my family if international students like me will be given opportunity to continue work in USA by passing this rule without any changes and issues.

Thanks&Regards,
Rohith.
