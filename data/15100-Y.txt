I absolutely support OPT stem extension program and It's ridiculous to say Opt Stem would take away Americans' jobs. American employers treat every candidate equally and sometimes they prefer us citizens since they need to pay money for the sponsorship of international students. But why there are still lots of international students get hired every year? That's because they are really skilled and smart, they went through interviews just like the other US candidates did and they got the offers!! We must admit that lots of international students use what they learnt to contribute to the US companies and the economy as a whole. Nobody can blame the us citizen 's unemployment to international students, to be honest, one lose job means he/she is not qualify for the job at all!! Not because he/she is a American native. If for any reason the opt extension is gone, US employers would be the ones that get hurt most.
