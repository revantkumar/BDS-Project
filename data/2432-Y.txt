Expanding OPT period could really help a lot of international students in their career path. For me personally, as an international student, I have spent five year for a doctoral training in United states, and would really love to spend more years in United States to sharpen my skills and career. But current H1b lottery exclude so many great international students from working in US, who could've contribute a lot. Thus, I 100% vote for expanding OPT, and I think this is a right decision.
