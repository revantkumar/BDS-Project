I agree with this rule. It is beneficial for both the U.S. and the students. Students with STEM degrees are very valuable and they can make a great contribution to the U.S. and to the world. They are talented and hard-working. The U.S. is short of talents in STEM degrees. And so do other countries. So why not provide them with better opportunities to stay in the U.S.?
