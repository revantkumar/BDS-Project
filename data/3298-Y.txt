I definitely SUPPORT this policy.

I am a house owner in Atlanta, GA and my main income source is renting houses to international students who go to college here. If this policy does not pass, there may be less international students, which means, less renter for me. International students, from my experience, are usually rich and in large numbers need to rent house in the local area of their schools. This is a huge market and we definitely don't want to lose it. So please let this policy pass!
