I strongly support the proposal.

As a HR from a famous IT company, I have interviewed hundreds of employee, most of whom are new graduated students. In some STEM subjects, especially in computer science. We hire a lot of international students and these international students make significant contribution to internet technology. 

Extending the opt are very important for the stability of all the internet company and development of internet technology.

In addition, fewer and fewer American students want to learn engineering and science. For example, I have four kids, none of them want to be a enginer in the future, they thought finance and business are easy to make money and much easier.
