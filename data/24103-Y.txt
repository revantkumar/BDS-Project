I STRONGLY SUPPORT the extension of OPT. As an international student, I paid more than $60,000 a year to come to this country to receive the best liberal arts education, and I am not even allowed to work for a few years and apply what I learn in classroom into the actual society. I have no intentions to "take away" jobs from American citizens as many of us plan to return to our home country in the future, but WE DESERVE the right to work for some time in this country instead of coming, leaving our money here, and then being driven away. Plus, the contribution we make to the U.S. society through working here is huge, and it is appalling how many people are against merely an extension of the OPT program simply because they are unwilling to face the fact that in a globalizing society, competition is unavoidable.
