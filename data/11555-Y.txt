I strongly support the expanding training opportunities for F-1 international student for the following reason:
1. The best way for learning is to practice. International student come to the United States for better education. The quality they get from the university is high grade but that's not enough. Only by utilizing them in the real world job will help the student have a deep understanding of what they know and what they don't know. 

2. International students are pretty diligent and hard-working, and they deserve the status to stay here if they work very hard for it. They understand that their situation is not stable and willing to sacrifice spare time to make a better job. Shouldn't we give them chances to let them believe that their hard work pays off, instead of telling them " you work hard but you status expired, so please go home"?

3. International students do bring competition to the U.S.citizens, but it's not just a bad thing. A certain amount of pressure helps people to get motivated. People works more efficient when they sense little safety. It push both side to achieve better result.

So I believe that extending the training opportunities for F-1 students is a win-win policy for both students and the U.S government.
