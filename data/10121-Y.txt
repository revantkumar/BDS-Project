I strongly support the 24-month opt extension for the following reasons: 1. The economy of the United States is relying heavily on the high-tech companies, which demands the precious work of foreigners with higher degrees. These hardworking people contributed to the GDP and the taxation a lot. 2. The opt extension is good for the development of companies. If the opt is not extended, it will increase the expenses for the companies to hire new and inexperienced ones every year. But if the opt is extended, these people can produce more profits for the company and the United States. 3. If the opt is limited in only a year, then new graduates tend to go back to their home country to find their long-term career. Because a year is too short to build a valuable career for a new graduate. Then the America will lose a great opportunity brought by the new and innovative graduates without the legal residence.
