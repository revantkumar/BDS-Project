I am an international student and completing PhD thesis in couple of months. I am planning to start a company based on my PhD research in US after completion of my Doctoral study. I will be the CEO of the company and will be hiring people once I register the company with the state. I am going to have a business mentor who will help to scale up the business. I am just wondering how entrepreneurs like me should address this mentoring and training plan.
