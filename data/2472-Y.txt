I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons: 

1. The extension would enable more global talents to make contribution to the U.S. industries. 

2. Without the extension, a lot of recent foreign graduates working at the U.S. companies will be forced to pack their stuff and return to their countries, which would be a huge disaster for many domestic companies. And these students will working for foreign companies to compete against US companies.
