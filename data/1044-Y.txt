This is the kind of policy that makes this country great. 

Being able to work after graduation is simply the reason for most STEM students to pursue a degree in the United States. They are just a tiny portion of labor in USA but they are creating a much bigger portion of fortune for this country. Thus, indirectly, STEM students are also creating more jobs for citizens. It's a win-win. Not to mention many of the most talented F-1 students have decided to become citizens after the OPT extension and became the leaders in their own area, being a strong pushing for the U.S. economy. Those who argued about citizens' job loss are not only selfish but also short-sighted.
