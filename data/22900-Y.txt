I strongly support the proposal for following reason:

The students who learned at American's school have been approved of their skills and performance by their school, which means they are qualified to continue working in this country. They can get their job offers because the companies need them and demonstrates that they are better than at least lots of native candidates applying to the companies. It would be a huge lost of the companies to lose them when they are well-trained and can make most contributions.

Also, America is famous for large diversity of its composition. In the history, many great scientists who contributed great value to American society are international students when they were learning in American schools. The international students, especially those majored in STEM subjects, are powerful and important to support the improvement of this country's technologies and economy. I believe most of the technology or scientific institutes/ companies won't want to see their most contributive and supportive staffs leave because they have to.

Competition is forever fair in this country especially when the judger is American people who are hiring talents. The internationals are getting hired strongly implies that this country need them. The meaning less protection of natives will stop the progress of the country.

So, I strongly support the proposal.
