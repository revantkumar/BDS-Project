There are more than 10 MILLION legal American workers without full-time jobs who want one. No more work permits until those 10 MILLION legal American workers have full-time jobs.

There are now over 90 MILLION working age legal American workers without a job.
USA does not need more immigrants to take jobs from these legal American workers.

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.
There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers (there are over 1 MILLION new STEM graduates every year).

OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

Social Security is already running a deficit now each year and will become insolvent if we allow this kind of abuse of the OPT program.
