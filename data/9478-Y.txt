Terence Hui In a word, I support this rule.

1. Lots of people attack this rule because they believe that opt students is low-payed and this is a good way for company to save money. From my classmates, some of them are US citizen and some of them, like me, are international students. As far as I know, we are equally payed for our contribution to the company. There is no way for company to save money for hiring an international student.

2. STEM OPT students are actually the potential guys to lead the development of US technology. It's possible there is another Google or Apple from those international students. This country is so proud of its compatibility for people from all over the world. If the government decides to stop the OPT EXT, it will be the beginning of the huge loss of talented people.
