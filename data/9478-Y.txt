America is after all an immigrant country, and it's definitely a good thing to attract talented immigrants. Students who come to the US for higher education pay for the tuition and also contribute to the economy in a good way. If the government does not pass this rule and does nothing to keep the talents from going back to their home countries, America will lose a great deal of brain power in the short term and soon lose the economic and technological competence in the world in the long run. Admittedly, allowing STEM foreign students to stay longer in the US may pose threat to American students in the job market, yet the native students, with their familiarity with the country and the culture and with their existing sociopolitcal perks, have so much advantages already and they are the ones who need to work harder and be more competitive, not the immigrants, who have worked so tremendously hard already to survive and thrive in an unknown territory and who, most importantly, should deserve the benefit from this bill. Thus, I strongly urge the rule be passed.
