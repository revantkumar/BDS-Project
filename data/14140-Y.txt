I support the STEM OPT extension rule because the nation has always been welcoming new talents from abroad. The extension rule helps to build up the economy and as far as jobs are concerned it was always competitive. I strongly feel that acquiring jobs are not easy and shouldn't be made so. The best must be picked out from a diverse group of talented people. This will help technology sector grow in a way that would benefit the nation as well. The United States has always been known for innovation. So why spoil the glory. Instead lets raise the bar and achieve new goals.
