I am strongly supporting this proposal for these two reasons:

1. A lot of American companies who have a large amount of STEM job openings but hard to find right candidates. This proposal can solve this problem, help these companies to grow faster and healthier, and improve American economy. 

2. For American economy, education income will be an important part--we should encourage and attract more and more international students to come to U.S. for their education. These students will not only increase the income for education industries but also the other relative industries, such as grocery, vehicle, traveling and so on. If this proposal doesn't be supported and the OPT will only be 12 months, it will extremely decrease the attracts of American education for international students. They have high possible to choose other countries for education because these companies can provide longer OPT time period, such as Singapore!
