I strongly support this new rule of OPT extension. International employees in STEM field have been contributing huge to the USs development. They are NOT grabbing citizens job opportunities, but creating new ones, since their contributions enhance US economy growth. Approval of this OPT extension rule provides better environment for these well-educated and trained people to work for the US. Finally, its beneficial for citizens.
