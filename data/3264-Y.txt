Jonathan Craig We should extend the optional training period for the following reasons:

1. The country needs talents with knowledge and skills in scientific fields of study, these talents currently form a major power supporting the advancement of science and technology in U.S.

2. The extension will attract international students to U.S., which brings income to the country and increase related job opportunities.

3. Currently tens of thousands of STEM students are employed in optional training status, the employers spend costs and time for them to get into the business with the wish that they generate positive impact to the firms in the long run, however without the extension of optional training period this is not possible and the benefits of thousands of business in U.S. will suffer negative impact.
