I cannot agree with this new rule more, both for the benefits of the U.S. and the F-1 nonimmigrants students with STEM. For one thing, it gives the U.S. companies to hire talents with best education of this countries rather than sending them back, which greatly improve the competition of these companies. For another thing, it gives a fair period of time for F-1 students to be trained and to get more chance to have H1-B visa for longer periods of working and contributions to this country.
I strongly agree on this new rule, because it's beneficial to the economy of the United States, the employers as well as the non-immigrant students.
