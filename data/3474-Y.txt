I strongly SUPPORT to extend STEM OPT. Currently, supply of STEM related job opportunities are way greater than demand. STEM students have great contribution to our country and will not take over US citizens' jobs. We need these skilled immigrants to work for us, and help us to achieve fundamentally strong economy. Please provide STEM students with longer period of OPT so that they make greater effort to our country.
