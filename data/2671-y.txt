Yi Xiao I am writing in support of extending the OPT period for F-1 students, for the following reasons. 

1. America values equal opportunity. It is a nation built by early immigrants, and it should not create an unequal environment for more recent immigrants. 

2. Many temporary jobs that graduates need in order to obtain long-term employment do not sponsor work visas. Thus, in order to gain the kind of experience that other non-foreign students have, it requires that F-1 students have an OPT period of reasonable length. 

3. Many F-1 students contribute greatly to research, academics, and other industries in the US. It is a loss for the US to have these students obtain an excellent education here, but be forced to work for other countries upon graduation.
