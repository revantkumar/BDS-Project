I am in favor of this new rule.

I am a technical recruiter at Amazon.com. I am responsible for recruiting high-talented software development engineers (SDEs) for Amazon. I saw a comment saying US citizens have decreased number of job opportunities due to the opt program. This is absolutely incorrect. From my point of view, Amazon has far more SDE openings than the number of applications we receive from US citizens. We hire foreign students to fill the openings, such that we have enough people to develop great things faster, and bring great benefits to United States. We know that Amazon has a large number of great products, like Amazon shopping site, Amazon Prime, Amazon echo, Kindle, Amazon Web Services, etc., and each product cannot come out without the help from developers we hire from foreign students.

Thus, the number of job opportunities is not becoming less due to foreign students, even they bring great value to US. With the opt program and the 24-month extension, we will develop more great products, hence make life for US citizens better.
