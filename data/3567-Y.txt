1. There is no shortage of Stem trained employees. That is just a scam to get cheaper workers for large companies. This has been proven again and again. However, even if it were true, why should we (the USA) be able to strip the best and brightest from other countries who are in need of their own intelligence resources? The 3rd World is short of doctors, yet we continually lure them to the us where they make life easier for us, but make life miserable due ot a shortage of trained personel where they come from. 

If the USA went in and strip mined natural resources the way we strip mine trained personnel from around the world, most people would be appalled. But somehow, when it means that big business can find cheaper labor costs, it is OK. 

I say it is not OK, and if these folks are as great and amazing workers as claimed, then the companies hiring them should be happy to pay a little extra for the right to allow them to work in the US. 

After all, wasn't it just a few short years ago that people were saying that everything would be done over the net, so why worry about foreign workers taking American jobs? Yeah, everyone seems to have forgotten that little scam as well. 

And if the idea is just so great, why isn;t it being debated openly in Congress?
