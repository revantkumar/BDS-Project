I am supporting the expanding, not only because it is good for F1 international students. Moreover, it is for the benefit for the states.

First of all, students with STEM degrees will very likely compete for job positions with other STEM degree holders only. Therefore, the extension will have no affect on native job seekers of other degrees.

Second, given that native STEM degree holders' unemployed rate is low or even negligible, the international STEM degree holders will not take over job positions for natives as well.

Last but not least, a lot of foreigners are creating a large amount of revenue for our country. For example, many technology companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft have a large portion of international employees working as software engineers. They are know the foundation of those big tech companies. They love hiring international employees mostly because international employees are working harder and bringing more revenue for their company.

History has told a this lesson many times, that is, if you try to keep your country in seclusion, you will be left behind sooner or later! We Americans cannot make this mistake!
