I strong support extension of OPT for f-1 stem grads to additional 24 months..

It would also help to provide guidelines for dual intent for f-1 visa holders as well visa applicants to overcome status change hurdles. It would be unfair to give dual intent protection only to those who are in US on f-1 visas while refusing visas to some qualified applicants because of the outdated 214b regulations. I urge you to extend dual intent status to f-1 students as well as visa applicants.
