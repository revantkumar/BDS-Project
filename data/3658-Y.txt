Yuan Tian I strongly support the proposal. The government should provide keep international students who learned knowledge from US universities making contributions in US. Keeping the talented people in the States and making them working for the States is never a bad idea, no matter what countries they are from. This proposal will also attract more international students to the States, which definitely benefits the academy. Why do the future international students choose the States? The programs here combine with long term OPT, they can get industrial experience during OPT. That is one of the major factors the international students concerns. Do the extended OPT harms native works' benefits? Not really. It might build up a more competitive environment. But this healthy competition environment only improves the quality of the employees. After all, the world economy environment is very competitive. The only way to stand out is improve the States' strength.
