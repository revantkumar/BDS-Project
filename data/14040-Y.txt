I strongly support the extension of OPT, the main reason is that in fact we do not have enough American STEM graduates to fulfill the needs from the industry field. If OPT is extended, international students could not only contribute to the USA industry even more than before, but also get more experienced so that the high-level education provided by American schools could be worthy instead of being wasted.
