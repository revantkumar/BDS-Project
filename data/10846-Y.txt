I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both United States and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in the US. US tech companies heavily rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizen here. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they have learned in class and gain more real-world industry.

International people could bring some work-force competitions to the US. But it is the moderate competitions that makes people and a nation become stronger. The OPT extension only allows international students to work in the industries for a while before they get their H1B visa. There's still a chance that they won't get the visa and need to go back to the home country. 

US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. And those tech companies are taking risks of potential losses of those international employees because of the H1B lottery system. Instead of worrying about international people that will take your jobs, please spend more time improving your own skills so that you can get your own job offers no matter who you compete with. Competitions are happening all over the world and those are what make people grow.
