As far as I know, United States have been the TOP of the world in the past century. The reason why it like this is that United States accepts the talents all over the world. If you look back to world war 2. So many Jewish scientists are accepted by US. which helps the technology grows really fast. So many generals who originally come from Europe help US win the war. The OPT can only be given to the people who has a degree in US which means they are really well educated. If we let them go, other countries will be really happy since they can get the talents without paying much. But they can grow faster and faster. I don't think in that situation US will keep competitive in the world. US may becomes more and more like some European countries which have wonderful benefits but lazy people. So it is the international students make United States much different. Why can't we keep them to make the country better. If we want to know who take the opportunity for local Americans in technology. You can see that Indian ICC get half of the H1b each year. And they can move Indian people without having the degree in US. I don't think they are qualified enough. So I wish we could think about this again and give the STEM people more opportunity to stay here. and contribute to the economy of US
