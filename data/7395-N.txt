I am opposed to extending either the duration of the visa program to match the H1B program or increasing the number of allowed recipients of these visas. Expansion of this program will cause irreparable harm to sons and daughters of US Citizens and Permanent Residents when they graduate college looking for a job. Please do not implement this proposed rule now or in the future. Thank you.
