I am a graduate student at the Ohio State university and strongly support the extension. Here are my reasons for the support:

1) US is currently facing STEM workforce shortage. This is just a fact. Companies like Facebook, Google hire international students not because they are cheaper labor force, but because US workers do not prefer to 
obtain a Graduate degree (MS/PhD) in these areas. Various news articles continuously point to the fact that there is STEM worker shortage in US.

2) Unemployment among the STEM graduates (under-graduate level) is lower in US, however most US-students take up jobs in marketing, sales etc. This represent inclination of American workers towards non-engineering/ non-science jobs. Meanwhile most F-1 students come for Science and engineering degrees. Note that these are advanced degrees MS, PhD. International students have shown more inclination towards pursuing these degrees in Science and Engineering. This shows that they are more interested in getting jobs in the STEM Areas.
Therefore, it is not the cheap labor that allows international students to get STEM jobs, but genuine interest and eligibility (due to advanced degrees) .

3) If at all American-STEM-job problem exists, it will not be solved by blocking the international students from getting those jobs. it will simply hurt the companies which rely on eligible candidates. Eventually they may end up out-sourcing those jobs across the world.

4) Students coming on F-1 visa eventually become green-card holders or citizens. This benefits US itself. This fits the picture of American dream, which is the sole reason for American economy.

5) Does US really want students who come to US and get advanced degrees in US to go back and contribute
