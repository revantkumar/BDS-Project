I definitely SUPPORT this proposal to extend OPT. This proposal will guarantee the benefits of American finance , international students and also American native students.
Fisrtly, with a longer opt time makes America stand out from other countries like England and Australia. When international students considering studying abroad, they hope to really learn more valuable things. Staying in industry for a longer time of course make them more competitive when they finish opt and return homeland. The fact that international students bring an important part of federal income makes it obvious that this proposal brings starlight benefits to American finance. Also, someone argues that those students who has stem extension is competing with them "unequally", by getting lower pay. As far as I know, we know grads have almost the same package of offers. Companies don't hire you because you are or not international student, they select you based on the ability! They even prefer native for language reasons and other. If someone say "I don't get job" that's because he doesn't reach the ability bar. Without qualified international candidates, the companies are forced to hire people lower than their bar, which you can easily imagine, will cause a slide in technology. Of this situation gets spread, the technology level of the low country will be lowered. The native students will also be lazier and couldn't do as good as they currently do when there's competition.
In short, this proposal doesn't harm anyone's benefits. On the contrary, it is of extreme importance. Please make this country a better and equal place for all kind to live.
