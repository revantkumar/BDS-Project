Fangyu Deng There is no doubt that I agree with the OPT extension rule. Personally I'm now a master student major in computer science and finished my internship in an IT company in CA. The critical reason why I chose the pursue my master degree in U.S rather than other country is the OPT as well as the extension for STEM students. According to my friends, they also hold the same view, treating OPT as the first place reason for their graduate study in U.S. 
To this extent, we can see that the most profitable part is U.S as well as those U.S institutions, who can use the new OPT extension to attract more outstanding international students to study abroad, paying high tuition and fees as well as high housing rents. Among those international student, the majority of them will go back to their home country after graduation or after their OPT internship, which will not affect the full-time job market for domestic residents.
Moreover, the employed foreign students are those who have excellent skills that meets the industrial requirements, with equal payments as other employees rather than low payments. That is to say, the OPT students can make the talents selection better in job market, which is an advantage for U.S industry.
Therefore, I strongly support the OPT extension rule.
