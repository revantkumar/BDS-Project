I agree with this proposal very much.
First and for most important, it is good for America's economy, especially for the novel technology area. As we all know, there are so many international students, especially in Computer Science and Engineering, and they are a very important part in Sillon Valley and other IT companies. This proposal would increase the chance for international students to work in America and keep the development for American Technology and economy. If not, there will be thousands of international graduates leave, it will definitely cause a huge loss for the companies who hired large amount of international workers.
