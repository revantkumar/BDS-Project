International STEM students spent a lot of money and time in United States to get a STEM degree, they learned the way to interact and cooperate with fellow students in US, they are just about to make contributions to the US society during the OPT, then why send them back home in such a hurry? Aren't these international students working hard? Aren't these international students making contributions to the US economy? Or it is just some lazy people scared of being involved in this little competition International STEM students have their own homes, most of them won't stick around for long, without sufficient OPT, you'll lose a lot of talented and smart people.
