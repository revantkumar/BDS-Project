I SUPPORT the opt-extension proposal. During the past decades, international students have made huge contributions to the development of economy and science in US. Nowadays, as many other countries are also devoted to improve technology competitiveness, in order to keep the competitive and advanced status of US, there are actually more talented students needed, and a large amount of them are international students.By expanding opt, more talented international students will be willing to contribute to the development of technology in US, which is definitely a benefit for US from a long-term perspective.

In addition to these potential contributions, by extending opt, international students will spend more money on renting houses, taking journeys and so on, which obviously help increase the income of US citizens.
