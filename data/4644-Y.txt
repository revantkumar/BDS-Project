I strongly support this proposal based on the following reasons:

1. The practical training is an important and necessary part of education in STEM fields. The OPT extension will grant more opportunities to the students in these fields.

2. This part of well-trained and well-educated students will fill the demand of advanced technical workers in United States. And it could make the industry in America better and boost the economy. 

3. Since a company has to pay more money and go through some extra processes to hire an international student, I don't think OPT extension will pose a threat to native tech workers. And in contrast, as the industry goes well and economy boosts, more and more job opportunities will be created.
