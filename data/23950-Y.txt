I strongly support this rule. America need students with stem degree because there are insufficient american can do these jobs. Of course finally you can hire enough american workers instead of hiring OPT students, but can these American create as much value as OPT students? High tech companies own lots of OPT students and these companies push other industries to grow. If you expel stem students, it is a disaster to America.
