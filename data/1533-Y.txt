today it's harder and harder for those high-tech workers to get their H1B visas, which is a damage for the development of U.S. software industry. also getting harder to get the working visas really makes U.S. hard to keep the intelligent foreign students. so i'm agree with the policy to extend the opt. it helps not only keep great foreign workers and students, but help eliminate those who are terrible workers so the companies have more time to decide who leave and who doesn't.
