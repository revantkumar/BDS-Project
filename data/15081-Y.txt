I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. There're many immigrants have made great achievements and they all give the credits to the U.S.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. OPT users won't get into every level and take away opportunities. Talent from all over the world will not only boost the economy and development, but also will motivate and inspire the domestic talents in the country, which will greatly benefit the country's future.
