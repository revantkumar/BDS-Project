I strongly support this rule for the following reasons: 1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. 2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area. 3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.

This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both the F-1 non-immigrant students and the U.S. technology companies. Without this rule, the 1-year OPT can only guarantee students to work for U.S. companies for one year. Companies usually spend a few months in training a new employee and have to find a replacement in year. With this new rule, companies can hire an F-1 non-immigrant student for up to 3 years which definitely will benefit production.
