Lauri-Anne Hammond It is beyond time to start supporting qualified American students as they enter the work force. The OPT program's proposal to expand the time a foreign worker can remain in place does just the opposite. These students want the OPT extension because it benefits them and so they are very vocal about it. They are also far more aware of it than American students because it is part of what they learn in coming here to gain an education and too American students don't even know about it. Of course tech companies love it because it reduces their cost to have employees.

It is time, especially in this difficult job market, to support American students instead of hampering them when they graduate and begin their job search. It is time for ALL companies, including those in STEM, to pay their fair share instead of the American people extending corporate welfare. 

Most of all, it is time to stand behind Americans and realize that if we don't, we are clearly part of the problem instead of part of the solution.
