I support. Personally, I hope the US provides longer time for me to study and work. For US reputation, because OPT ext is a rule for a small portion of the people in US, so it should not affect too much; at the same time, if US supports this rule, this will be a big plus for US reputation in the world, and if US does not support it, this will be making a lot of people very disappointing. So I think this rule should benefit a lot.
