I support this proposal. This proposal definitely will benefit US people. From what I know, almost every High tech company in the US has a large number of foreign engineers, many of which are F1 students who are in OPT and OPT extension status. And many startups in the US need engineers with solid technical background, but the salary level of experienced engineers are too expensive for them, so OPT students are perfect candidates for them. During their stay (including OPT extension), they can support a new company until the company can find more experienced and senior engineers. This is not a immigrant proposal, after all. I don't think this will make F1 students take resources from US people.
