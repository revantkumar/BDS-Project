I am an individual commenting on behalf of myself and I believe that the OPT Extension rule as proposed does not provide enough time for students who complete multiple STEM degrees to gain practical experience. While the proposed ruling is certainly a welcomed development, additional time longer than 24-months should be granted to students with multiple STEM degrees.

As a benefactor from the OPT program I welcome the establishment of the STEM OPT extension rule and the dedication of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to all foreign visitors and students currently employed in the United States. 
I am currently an F-1 student with active employment which I obtained using through the previous OPT system. After completion of my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I sought to attend graduate school to further my education. Having completed both a Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering, I am eligible for the 24-month STEM OPT extension as proposed in section V "Discussion of Elements of the STEM OPT Extension." Sub-section F of this rule on "Previously Obtained STEM Degrees" permits students with degrees other than STEM to apply for OPT extension based on their previously obtained U.S. STEM degrees, however, this provision is not sufficient. 

While I understand the need for a blanket rule that would not be difficult to implement, the ruling is disadvantageous to students who complete two STEM degrees, back to back, without a break in their studies. 

In the case of students with multiple STEM degrees and no prior STEM OPT extension, time-not-utilized under the previous STEM OPT extension should be granted at the point of graduation with a second degree such that students with multiple STEM degrees are granted OPT extension which last longer than 24 months. Because a total of 36 months to gain practical experience for knowledge and education acquired over six years (BSc & MSc or MSc & PhD) is not enough and should be extended.
