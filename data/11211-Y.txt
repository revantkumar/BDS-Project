I am all for the OPT extension but there should be strict regulations with respect to fake resumes and proxy interviews and also on the job support. Many of these students start off by showing fake experience of 5-8 years and get through interviews by making someone experienced take the interview for them, since most of it is through Skype or over the phone. This has made it very difficult for others who have real experience to get a job.
