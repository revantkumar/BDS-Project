The DHS was corrupt in trying to jam this through without the required public comment. Why are we giving American companies an incentive to hire foreign workers? Is this because this administration hates America and wants to flood it with foreigners who hold no allegience to this country? Do they want to bankrupt American students when they can't pay back their student loans? This administration is stacking the deck against America. There needs to be less immigration here. The immigration laws should be to help America, not sink it. I agree with Ted Cruz, Rick Santorium, and Donald Trump. I hope it is not too late to right this ship.
