OPT extension is good for the United States. 

OPT is important to the international student to stay and work in the United States, which does not necessarily mean that be harmful to the US citizens. An extension for OPT will attract more outstanding foreign students, which means the universities can have better students to do better research, and the companies can hire more productive employees. Both of them are definitely good for the US economy, and consequently, for the people of the United States. 

Otherwise, these hi-tech companies might choose to move abroad, just like manufacturing industries, to hire those talented people. Therefore, the budget of these US companies will increase dramatically, and the job opportunities will be gone.
