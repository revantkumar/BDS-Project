The decision on denying the extend of OPT is selfish. I am used to be an international student and I went through the bad market and I know how hard it is for us to survive in this country. The denier announce that all the STEM job shall go to the local. But if everyone should have the equal opportunity to fight for the future. Even though the OPT extend is approved, the future is still a tough path. We still have long way to go to gain experience and make a living. Anyway, the US society won't get hurt if the extend is approved.
