Sarah Fan I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for OPT extension.

I came to US in 2015, as one of the best student from China. I attended Stony Brook University for a master degree. As we all know, US becomes the best country in the world because of its achievements in science and technology. And these achievements can never come true, if US did not value talented people as it did in the past decades. 

Currently, I attend an CPT/OPT workshop at our university. I find that according to the policy in U.S., employer has to pay 4000$ more if he or she hires a foreign student. 4000$, which is high enough to guarantee that the employer will consider citizen first. Only if he or she cannot find a capable one, a foreign student will be considered.

Another important thing to mention is, most STEM students will pay a lot of tax to the US government. After they leave, the government will suffer from a financial deficit. Poor guys will not have as good welfare as now. Even US economy will be greatly affected, I believe. Then, in a short time, maybe some Americans will be easier to find a job. But in the long run, most US citizens will suffer from US's fading.

As the best students, we can find the best job in anywhere of the world. Do you think we don't want to fight for our own country? Of course we do, and non of our intelligence and contribution will benefit US. If the government wants to be short sighted, sure you can. But everyone can see the consequence.
