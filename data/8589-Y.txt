I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International student with their learned knowledge in U.S. will enhance the competitiveness of stem companies and the industries in U.S.
