I support the extension because as an international student, it is super important to have that period to make sure we can find the job in US.

In lots of job openings, international students don't have equal opportunity to compete, if we have this extension, it is possible that we have larger opportunity to find a better job and we don't need to rush because of time limit. Then it will be better to allocate the resource because international students are more possible to choose a job they can contribute better. 

Also, the diversity is good for the industry of US. International students have advanced degree and working in STEM field are very hard working and are valuable for a country. They have bilingual advantage and will bring more collaboration opportunity in all possible area.

I sincerely hope that the extension can become valid and international students can make better contribution in their job.
