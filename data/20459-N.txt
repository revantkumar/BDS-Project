There are numerous reasons that Optional Practical Training Program (OPT) should NOT be expanded. First of all, there are already far too many people in the U.S., seriously degrading our ecosystems and biological diversity. We should be reducing immigration, not increasing it. Also, there are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree. We should be putting our citizens first. There are about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties, many of whom would return to those fields with appropriate incentives.

There are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas, yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields. BIG TECH LOBBYISTS HAVE SPENT OVER $1 BILLION SEEKING IMMIGRATION INCREASES, BUT MICROSOFT AND HEWLETT-PACKARD ARE LAYING OFF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES. You can be sure that OPT foreign workers will displace graduating Americans who are struggling to repay massive student loans. 

By turning the F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas, DHS is trying to violate or cheat on the Congressional limits on H-1b 3-year work visas.
