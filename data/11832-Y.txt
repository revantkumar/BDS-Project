As it says, DHS continues to believe that the E-Verify program is an important measure to ensure the integrity of the STEM OPT extension. The E-Verify program is an Internet-based service operated by USCIS, in partnership with the Social Security Administration (SSA). This program currently is the best means available for employers to determine employment eligibility of new hires and, in some cases, existing employees.

This E-verify program is built to protect that everyone (including both US citizenship and intertional students) has the equal chance to competite for the job. When hiring employee, many Ameircan corporations require American citizenship only. Many Americans have jobs in these corporations already. Now someone wants to cancel the OPT Extension and claims that International students are "stealing" their jobs. That is not a good excuse. As I mentioned, many Amercian companys have already protected US citizens. Under this situation, those Americans still can not find a job just because they are not good enough. They fear to face this fact. It is ridiculous when they blame it on International students. In my opinion, some of those people is discriminating International students.
