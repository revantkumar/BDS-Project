I strongly recommend that this 24 month extension should be approved.

I believe OPT-extension gives the companies, societies and government of the United States a more appropriate method to absorb foreigners to serve this country. Now working with OPT with maximum 36 months doesn't mean we could enjoy any welfare, doesn't mean we would pay less taxes and doesn't mean we would eventually be a citizen of this country, and it's really confusing that some people consider us "enemies".

As an international student graduated from an American school, I just want to put what I have learned in local class into application locally as the experience I earned in a foreign country may not directly applicable in my home country, I would like make my contributions to this society no less than citizens, I would like to increase the communication between Americans and Chinese, I don't see any negative items for this OPT extension program. 

International students with STEM degrees should be entitled to work for this country without a doubt. Personally speaking, very few US citizens in my school chose my major simply because they were not interested in this area, which means either unqualified engineer or reluctant engineers will take these jobs if this program is eventually vetoed, I don't think that's the result anyone would like to see.

Thanks,
