This is so sad. If I'm lucky, my wife and I get to see my son and his family once a year. Why? Because he is an American graduate who couldn't get a job in California, so he's been teaching English in Japan for almost 10 years now.

Now, the Government wants to take away more jobs from American graduates. It's just unbelievable that Americans are on the bottom of the totem pole in their own country!
