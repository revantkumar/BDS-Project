Most American STEM Students have great student loans, most frozen while seeking employment or working part time, while the federal government(taxpayer) insures payment. Why would our government offer preferential advanced educational training opportunities to further develop skills of foreign students and assist employers in the cutting of payments to FICA and Medicare basically putting American students out of work? Our nation should support advanced development of American STEM students who accordingly will support our social welfare systems along with repayment of government protected student loans. No government offered job opportunity with advanced skills training is afforded to the same American student. The business is offered savings from paying mandated U.S. benefit costs per foreign candidates, yet No approved curriculum is designated to be met by employer offering this supposed advanced training opportunity. We have a plethora of foreign multi degree, over-educated students who continue to enroll in more government programs to remain in our country. They are not tracked to confirm whereaboutsand are getting first career STEM opportunities ahead of indebted American young adults who are not granted additional free advanced degree opportunities. Possibly add a change in that all STEM foreign and American are offered employment balancing training salary with benefits pd by employer in first year out of school to level hiring with employers.
