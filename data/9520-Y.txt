Martin Tian I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international financial engineering master student from China and was a quant analyst at Goldman Sachs. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I do not believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies and big investment banks, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents.
