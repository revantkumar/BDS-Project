I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal because USA is Short on STEM Talent.

1. Lots of STEM jobs are unfilled in huge numbers. There are some 40,000 students graduated with computer science degree each year, but roughly 4 million (4,000,000) job vacancies for computer workers in United States.

2. A lot of comments saying that "Work opportunities should be open to US citizens but not foreigners", this is not right at all. STEM extension is for people in STEM area, U.S do not have enough labor for STEM area. A lot of positions only open to green card holder/US citizens. It seems not too many companies want to hire OPT students because they couldn't work in the company for longer than 29 months without further sponsership. Sometimes the program could take more than 3 years and it is not good for a students with OPT visa to participate. If the company could find the right candidate with US citizenship, why they have to find some OPT holders as a substitution?

3. The article 'Short on STEM Talent' written by Jonathan Rothwell on Sep,2014 said: 'Oddly, a small contrarian group of academics claims that not only is there no shortage of STEM talent, but the U.S. actually has too many graduates in these fields. They say that universities oversupply such grads, citing statistics showing that many computer science majors work in other occupations, for example. IN FACT, the skills of these graduates are highly valued beyond a narrow subset of occupations, further evidence of STEMs high demand. Indeed, computer science degree holders are commonly employed in managerial positions, business operations, engineering, and even as top executives hardly evidence of a wasted education.' 

All in all, OPT extension would bring out great benefits to U.S. I highly support this proposal.
