Lok Liang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The tuition they pay is a tremendous support for our universities, with which they can admit more U.S. citizens and give more teenagers from a poor family the chance to receive higher education. In addition, they bring great profits to the landlords near the universities.

2. Rejecting international students would harm our long-term benefits and cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. Brain is power and it is a great loss to drive our highly educated brains to other countries. By ousting their talents America is creating the next Alibaba, not the next Facebook!

3. The diversity of our society is very important. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices. And the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings. For example, Einstein is a German, he gave a advice to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to help U.S. become the first country to have atomic bomb. Today, these international students from STEM subjects could help U.S. lead the development of technology.
