Lupe Mendez You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 50% - from US$4.4 trillion in 2012 to US$6.2 trillion. International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM. Even with more than 13 million Americans unemployed, the manufacturing sector cannot find people with the skills to take nearly 600,000 unfilled jobs, according to a study last fall by the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte.
