I STRONGLY SUPPORT this decision for the main reason that this rule represents the value of the U.S. that everyone has the equal chance. In recent years, the foreign STEM students helped a lot in improving economy by working hard in technological industry. By passing the extension rule, It will encourage engineering companies and other technology companies to hire international STEM students, which is really GOOD since these talented foreign people will help the companies make big progress in high-tech area. Also, the STEM extension rule may attract more talented students, which is good for the U.S. educational industry.
