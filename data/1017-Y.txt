Ashutosh Shukla I am a green card holder who was once a F1 Student. I was benefited by this program and I strongly believe the program improves the US economy and helps US maintain its stronghold in the STEM fields. 

After seeing multiple claims about how the students on OPT pay less tax and do not contribute towards the US economy, i decided to enter my thoughts on this particular claim.

If the problem is that the students pay lesser taxes than their counterparts, then the solution to this problem would be to increase the tax paid by the students working in their STEM Extension. They are already paying the Social Security tax, they could be included in the medicare and other taxes. I am sure the students would be ok with the increase in tax if it means they get to improve the plight of their brethren. 

If students not paying the extra 1.5% of the tax is a major problem for US economy, wouldn't it be a bigger problem when these students have to go back to their country leaving the work here high and dry? You would be facing a sudden loss in work force which might bring down the technological giants to their feet. Also, is it possible to fill half a million position which would be vacant if the STEM OPT students were forced to leave.

In order to avoid a major disruption in technological advancement I strongly urge that this rule be executed

Thanks,

Ash
