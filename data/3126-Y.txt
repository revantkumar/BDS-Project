I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First,the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

The second, diversity is very important for the U.S. because A lot of people in the U.S. before the major achievements are international students in the U.S..

The third, competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition can help U.S. choose better talents, promote the average level of all, both international students and native students, can better improve the competence of the U.S. in the world.
