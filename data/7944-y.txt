Jeff Murray DHS' proposed rule is pushing the ones raised and trained at home out of the job market that we created these education initiatives for and handing those jobs to students who have no ties to the U.S. other than their education.

Because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program.

It is pure fiction that someone with a master's degree in electrical engineering needs an additional three years to work as an intern to be a productive professional. Instead, the duration seems to come out of thin air, based purely on what the political types in the Obama White House believe that they can get through without facing significant opposition.

DHS, by defining a recent college gr ad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.

There is no training in this program. It is just one more foreign worker program and it has nothing to do with students; it is for recent alien college graduates
