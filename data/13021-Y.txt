I STRONGLY agree extending the OPT. I'm a program manager in a startup company at Bay Area. I have to say that there are many excellent candidate employees among F1 students. I'm afraid that not expanding OPT may cause us lose a lot of good employees and it may also jeopardize the prosperity of Bay Area, since there is not enough fresh blood.
