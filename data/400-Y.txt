Vian Wang Thanks DHS for proposing such a great plan! My name is Vian Wang and i am currently a graduate student learning STEM major. In my opinion, expanding OPT will bring following benefits.
1. Boost the development of IT area in the US. After expansion, CS students have more flexibility to work for their companies and create values for their companies in the US.
2. Everyone deserves a equal chance. We international students are told thousands times of freedom and equality in the US. We fight for our rights!
