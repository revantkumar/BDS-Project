King Wang I support the new proposal for extension OPT to 36 months since it is an efficient response from DHS to minimize the potential impact on STEM students in Feb 2016. Many STEM students chose U.S. universities for higher education because of the availability of 29 months of practical training under the current rule. It would be a huge disappointment if students would instead only be able to remain for 12 months due to a delay in rule-making.

I read many American citizens comments that are against the proposal because they think OPT students take their jobs and cause unemployment in the US. Although it is not true, considering OPT students visa status and verbal problem in job searching, I am still afraid the final rule may be affected by those negative comments. However, I think at least students working on OPT extension and their employers deserve a chance to fulfill their current position. No one prepares for this sudden change and I think DHS should at least taking care of those already working on their OPT extension and those who will apply extension in Feb. and Jan. 2016 before the possible revoking.

Therefore, I hope following options should be considered: Any application for OPT STEM extension received by USCIS but not yet approved before Feb 12, 2016 should still be approved. Moreover, any student already approved for a 17-month extension should be allowed to continue employment based on the approved OPT STEM extension.
