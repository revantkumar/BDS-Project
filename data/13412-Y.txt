I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. 
From the perspective of lots of U.S. companies, especially IT industry, they need the support from foreign STEM students because the number of American students is definitely not enough for the demands. And for the time being, many of foreign students, including me, who have already been working and make great contribution to their companies did not get H1B for the first time lottery. If the STEM extension is cancelled, it would be a disaster to the whole U.S. IT industry! Consider the time, money and efforts that a company provides to training a new employee, and when the employee can be productive to the company, they have to leave, it is obviously that the company would lost more!
In addition, we cannot deny that the STEM extension policy is a great attractiveness for talented students to come here for further study, which also makes U.S. to be competitive over other countries. If an ocean of students do not come to U.S. due to the cancel of STEM police, there is no doubts that it would be a threat to the US educational institutions financially.
In the end, foreign students do not "steal" job opportunities from locals, companies only hire people who are eligible for the positions, not depends on where are they from. If no eligible candidates are available in America, they will hire oversea, which may cost more money. The more competitive, the better a country will be. It does not make sense to object the STEM extension policy blindly.
