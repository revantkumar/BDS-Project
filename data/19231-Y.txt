For this country, we need STEM-related talent to compete globally, and we will need even more in the future. It is not just a matter of choice: for the United States to remain the global innovation leader, we must make the most of all of the potential STEM talent this country has to offer.

Especially, business needs a talent pipeline providing the skilled employees who can routinely use scientific and technological skills in their jobs. Fortunately, more and more companies and their senior executives recognize this and are putting their money where their long-term interests are.

For America, improving achievement in science, technology, engineering, and math will go a long way to ensuring that our country can compete globally, create jobs, and achieve the levels of economic growth that will buttress Americans' standard of living and social safety net. High-quality STEM education represents an opportunity that students, workers, educators, and business must seize if we are to keep the country strong.
