The economic contributions of international students are in addition to the immeasurable
academic and cultural value these students bring to our campuses and local communities.
International students:
Build bridges between Americans and other nationalities;
Bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs;
Support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework, making it
possible for U.S. colleges and universities to offer these courses to U.S. students; and
Support programming and services on campus for all students by paying out-of-state
tuition, funded largely by non-U.S. sources.
