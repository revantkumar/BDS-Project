Patricia James OPT program does more good than harm for technology companies these year. And I really want to share my experience.

STEM OPT students can hardly influence native students in finding jobs, especially in engineering jobs. Ive been recruiting new grads from top universities to different technology companies for years, and I could say most of the time native student get hired first comparing to an equal skilled STEM OPT students. Why? English is not native language for those international students, one definitely will feel much comfortable taking with a native speakers, a native engineer degree new grads. So why would the companies hire a foreign student to a native student if both of them showing equally skills?

Actually, I received more resumes from OPT students than citizens these years. That could be the reason why one can see more and more non-American employers in the company. To me this is a good thing, since some of them were showing great attitude and excellent skills during the interview. And I received many positive feedback from the company after hiring those good candidates after few months.

I dont see any good reasons to terminate OPT program.
