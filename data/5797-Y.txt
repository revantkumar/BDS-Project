We are well educated here and just want a chance to practice in real professional environment. It should definitely be a part of our training. However, current opt only gave us one year to enroll in the professional service. Think about this, what could u do in just one year, especially when u are a new graduate who just step in ur career. You spent 3 months to be familiar with the environment, spent another 3 months to learn new knowledge and establish ur network. While u are ready for everything and are prepared to create more value, u we're told ur time is gone and u need to leave. Then what's the meaning of professional training ?

And for company , it's also a big loss if they lost a well trained employee in just one year. They need to search for other people and train again. It's a waste of time and money. In this way, more and more companies will tend to refuse to hire opt candidates and there is even no chance for us to get the opportunities.

In this way, I definitely support the extension of opt! It' will be double win for both company and students. Moreover, it will create more value for US
