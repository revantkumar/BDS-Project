This is a great proposal. 12-month OPT is not enough for students to fully apply what they've learned from college or graduate school to the companies where they intern. By virtue of this extension, the F1 students will have time to grow proficient and productive in their internship, so they will benefit from this progress. Consequently US companies will benefit from the economic growth they bring, and US government will benefit from the increasing revenue from these companies. Finally these benefits will pay back to all the US citizens and aliens.
