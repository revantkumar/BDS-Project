I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. OPT program is directly related to US educational institutions and is fundamentally a highlight of the US educational market. I am an international mechanical engineering master student from China. The pivot reason for me to pursue my master degree in US is that US could provide me the industry training opportunity after graduation, instead of Canada, Singapore, and British. I am deeply convinced that OPT extension can give enough time for students to gain practical experience and achievements. Therefore US educational institutions can keep fascinating international students.

2.Dont forget that success of US is not certain and American stories have never been inevitable, the reason of US leading the world is that it can absorb diverse talents around the world. US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which also means more revenue and tax. In addition US tech companies, like Facebook, also need Chinese students to open the Chinese market.

3 International students should not be responsible for sluggish of wage growth and moving them out is just temporary relief. If so, the post of duty just outflows to areas with relatively cheaper cost, meanwhile the US innovation will dry up. For example almost all entrepreneurs in China have experience study in US that proves that US is driving out innovators and job creators.
