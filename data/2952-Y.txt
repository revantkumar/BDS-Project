Lakshmi Gadde Many international students who use the stem extension not only learn a lot from the companies but also provide a lot of help in company development. Usually any experience in one company less than 2 years is not considered good amount of experience gained and also its a costly process for the companies to recruit new employees every year(this is especially bad for start-ups). Every student who graduates and uses the OPT and stem may be working for the first time as a full time employee in the their area of interest.This is their chance to explore the different kinds of work positions available in their field. 
A lot of international students are leaving the country as their STEM is expiring. If this continues the companies that invested in hiring them will not get their return on investment of the employee. Also, the demand for the employees in this field will increase which will increase the salaries for employees with more stable working visa. As the talented employees leave this country the companies will be paying more for the visa status as compared to talent. 
To conclude I support 24 months of OPT will bring up US economy and help international students which is a win-win for everyone.
