I do strongly support the proposal of OPT extension for the following reasons:

1. International students have made a huge contribution for the growth of USA economy in recent years, especially in the field of technology. If the OPT extension rule was cancelled, USA would lost most of technology potential talent people. 

2. In almost every university's engineering college in USA, most of students are come from China, India or other foreign countries. Obviously, there are just a few USA students study EE, CS or other relevant engineering majors. If international students can not own a longer OPT to train in USA, definitely, America will lost lots of talented and professional technical people. They have grasped the core technology in America, but take back to their country without making contribution to America. What a pity.
