Kyle Liu I just want to say two things. 
One, almost 900,000 international students come to the United States every year, contributing tens of billions of dollars to the American economy, creating more jobs. These students and their families pay full and expensive tuition to US universities, and these students are and will be very important to the universities in financial terms. In return for their cost, these students hope to obtain training in the USA in order to pursue good job opportunities in their own countries in the future. In case the international students lose the training opportunity, they will not come to the US for college like they do today. First, the economy will lose tens of billions of dollars a year, and numerous jobs. Second, universities will charge American students much higher tuition and need more of tax payers' money to support them. 

The other thing, the US leads the world by its high technology. Everyone should know how important international talents are to the high tech industry. Losing these international talents, those high-tech companies will lost competitive advantage over foreign competitors. High tech companies and the economy can NOT afford to lose international talents.
