I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Those students who had learned knowledge from the U.S. universities should have the chances to work and make profits for the U.S. society, which should be their right and more important be their responsbility.

2. There are many people who have made GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS to the U.S. and the world are used to be an international students. The U.S. government should enrourage those students make contribution to the world NO MATTER they are a domestic student or a international student.

3. Competition does exist. Most international students who had received high degree did not gain a job with low payment. Let student work in the U.S. will help U.S. increase its competition in the worldwide.
