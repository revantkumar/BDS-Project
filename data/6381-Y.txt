Zhoutong Fu I sincerely agree with and support the proposal to extend international students' OPT related to stem majors. U.S., as a nation originated from immigrants, has always been kind and nice to people with expertise around the world which in return has witnessed the tremendous growth and enhancements from technology. 

Extending OPT for excellent international students serves the people of U.S.
