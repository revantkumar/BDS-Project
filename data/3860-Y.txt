I am from China and I am seeing a lot of my friends leaving U.S. due to working visa issues. They work for companies like google, facebook, LinkedIn and Tripadvisor. After failed to obtain a working visa in US, they transfered to other office in Ireland, Canada and China, doing the exact same job, get similar salaries and NOT paying any income tax to the US. 

Making OPT extension longer will be a win-win situation for all parties.
