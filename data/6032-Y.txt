Yang Luo I support this STEM OPT extension proposal strongly for several reasons:

First, extension of OPT would improve the competitiveness of US high level education. Longer OPT would help international student apply what they learn to intern, even full time job. In this way, student would become more professional and more experienced after graduation. This new OPT policy would attract talented people all around world come to US purse their further education.

Second, student with great potentials would explore and refine their skills during a longer work time on OPT, if STEM OPT was extended. They can make contributions to US continuously.

Finally, stand on fairness, US government should provide fair opportunity for foreigners who study in US, love US and wan to purse a brand new life in US. Diversity is much important for a country, and it is also why US became a super power country around the world.

Again, I SUPPORT this proposal extremely.
