The new extension rule has several advantages for boosting US economy. First, the companies or institutes that hire OPT employees value the diversity of their employees and thus create an innovative environment. Second, by extension for a longer time, the companies and institutes could better evaluate the performance of their OPT employees to determine whether it is worth to provide H1B support in the future. Third, it will be more likely the OPT employees are committed to working rather than worrying about the legal status for working.
One may argue that the wages for hiring OPT employees are generally lower than native born employees, thus it reduces and competes the job markets for native born employees. One solution to that will be increasing the minimum wages for OPT employees using median instead of minimum wages in the fields while taking into account of location and education completed. In that way, the decisions of hiring employers will not be affected by the lower cost of hiring an OPT employee.
