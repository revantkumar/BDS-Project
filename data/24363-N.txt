It's time we start to protect the hi-tech jobs in this country for US citizens. We have plenty of qualified technical people here and do not need foreign workers coming in to lower the standard of living of our workers by these companies being able to cut labor costs by hiring these workers. I have personal knowledge of these actions. I was a CTO for a tech company that laid off our own workers only to hire H1B workers at much lower salaries in order to save money. I refused and resigned my position in protest. This needs to stop now before we become a third world country.
