I support the OPT extension. I believe it will be a great boost for the US economy just as it was before. 
Firstly, it is obvious that only the best international students may have the opportunity to work under this extension, and the ones lacking knowledge and skills will have to go back to their home country because no employer will provide them a job position after finding out their value. 
Secondly, the US has much more job demand in the STEM field than it can supply by itself. (Refer to Jonathan Rothwell, "Short on STEM Talent", "U.S.News", Sept. 15, 2014, http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real)
Also, as US economy is part of the world economy system, to prevent importing students with good knowledge is equivalent to giving great high tech workers to America's competitors. Why do the US train those students with scholarship, sponsorship, even paying their living expenses if they cannot be utilized in the US? 
My opinion is that the OPT extension is a good rule to utilize valued high tech students, and the workforce demand in STEM field is far from full.
