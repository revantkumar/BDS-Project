I support this proposal.
a.U.S. was founded on the belief that freedom and opportunities can be pursued on this land by people with talents and dreams from all around the world. This belief, by now, has made U.S. the greatest nation earth. Whoever is opposing this proposal is NOT an immigrant generations ago?

b.Recruiting and the job market are really about the qualification. Hiring international students has to go through more complicated process and cost the company more with the sponsorship with the risk of students having to return to their home countries without the H1B later. Its already difficult for international students, so why do these hi-tech companies still hire international students? Dont they know hiring international STEM students costs more, is more complicated, and has more risks? The only answer is that they ARE QUALIFIED for the position and can finish tasks efficiently. Otherwise why would profit-driven companies hire international STEM students?

c.International STEM students are not the cause of lower salary in IT, but OUTSOURCING is. Cancellation of STEM will only lead to more outsourcing instead of driving salary levels up. In fact, STEM students earn salary higher than average salary level in the country and its ridiculous to assume them of causing lower salary.

This proposal will only drive U.S. economy and benefit the job market in the long term. Therefore I fully support this proposal.
