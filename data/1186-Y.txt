I support this proposal because of the following reasons:

1. Students like us will have more time to make contributions to U.S.
2. Most of the Chinese students are the ONLY child in their family, they will return back to their country after the OPT. 24 month more working experience can make them more competitive when finding jobs in China.
3. This proposal will bring some competitions between U.S students and foreign students, but they are positive and good for the society. It will bring more competitive grads to the local companies and thus cast positive impact on the overall economy.
4. The new proposal will make U.S's college more attractive than colleges in other country, for example, the UK, since students will have the opportunity to gain more hands on experience after graduation. More foreign students will also benefits the college because of the academic diversity.
