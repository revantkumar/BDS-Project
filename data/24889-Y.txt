I am an international student who obtained my STEM bachelor degree two years ago. I didn't get the H1B lottery this year and my OPT Extension run up. I had no choice but went back to MBA program. I think if I can still use my previous STEM bachelor degree to do another Extension after I complete my MBA would be very helpful for my career.
