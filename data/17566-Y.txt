We definitely need these foreign students to fill our STEM job market. Our nation and people will benefit from this proposed rule in both short term and long term.

In the short term, this proposed rule will allow high tech companies, like Google, Amazon to hire these potential employees with lower cost. And this won't threat our native job market, since the number of native STEM students is highly less than the demand of job markets.

In the long term, these highly educated students are the potential immigration in the future. Imagine how much money our government need to invest on a native children to bring them to this education level. A lose immigration rule which improves the rate of the high educated in our popularity with low cost should be encouraged. 

Last but not the least, remember, the American came from nowhere but immigration.
