Sahil Dhir USCIS has come up with a very good STEM OPT plan. I think this should be increased to 36 months from 24 months as it will help increase the economy of US. If it is reduced to just one year, many international students will stop coming to US as it will give only one chance for them to H1B lottery whose number of petitions are increasing every year.
If International students stops coming , it would mean less students in University and less revenue for universities which would directly impact the economy.

Also STEM extension of 24 months will help the International students who have graduated from US universities to make contribution to US economy by working for a longer time.
