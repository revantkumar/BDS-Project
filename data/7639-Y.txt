John Spendlove Immigrants who come to the United States to obtain STEM degrees should be encouraged to stay here once they have graduated. Otherwise foreign STEM grads will take their skills and education back to their home countries costing America the opportunity for job-creating innovation. Not only do we have a shortage of qualified STEM candidates in many U.S industries but also many of the these STEM graduates will start new companies that create high paying jobs. The rule change being proposed will help keep foreign STEM graduates in U.S. For these reasons I strongly support this rule change and further immigration reforms that encourage highly skilled immigrants to stay and work in the U.S.
