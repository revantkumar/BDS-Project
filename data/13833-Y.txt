It is great if this can be approved. This can attracts more excellent foreign students come to America to study. Also increases the possibility they may choose to work in America after graduation. A lot of foreign students are very competitive and they can contribute a lot to the economy of America as well.

Some people think foreign students stolen their work. It is not true! The majors of most foreign students who choose to stay in America to find a job are those majors which are not popular between American. Even it is popular, the need of the companies in this industry are still much bigger then those American students can provide. That's why a foreign students can find a job in America.

I always thinking that inclusive of America is the main reason that it can become a super power. Let more foreigner students come to America can help it grow and make it stronger.
