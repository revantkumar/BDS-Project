Chalie Green I Strongly SUPPORT this ruling.

I have been working in a web design company as a manager for many years. As their country become stronger and stronger, more and more companies in China and India hire us to design website for them. For the convenient hiring opt students, I could easily chat with them and do business with the other companies. These opt students help a lot. 

I have never worried that American's jobs could be take over by their students. There is competition, there is improvements. Don't just look at immediate interests but long benefits.
