Training for F-1 Nomimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees shows total disregard for U.S. Citizen Students. The folks coming in have usually had the best opportunities their countries offer. They have no worries about financing their education. They are recruited by the best companies because they are foreign students. They have no problem getting established financially because they can use their earnings to set up their lifestyle since they are not burdened with huge financial aid paybacks. Just one more way for our scheming politicians to obligate a new group of voters. Since politicians can no longer frighten students with a science background with hell fire, they weaken them by giving their jobs away.
