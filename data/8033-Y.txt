This is a great policy as it allows international students to learn more about the United States culture and working environment, which is also an essential part of learning experience. In addition, it gives US firms the ability to find talent to help to grow the firms, and thus boost economic growth. 

I deem this policy as a win-win policy for both the US and the rest of the world.
