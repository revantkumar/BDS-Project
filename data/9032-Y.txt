jie chen I think the OPT does not take jobs from qualified Americans at all.
1. Americans are born to have advantage on language. So it is very common that less skilled Americans get employed but more skilled foreign students does not due to language issue.
2. There are not so many Americans majored in STEM, which lead to talent shortage in this majors.
3. 24 month OPT Extension is much better than 17 month since it is gives all students the same fairness
4. American needs foreign talents to keep its position in the whole world. It is that American needs foreign talents, not the foreign talents need American.
