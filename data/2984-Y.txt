The main reason for an international student like me to come to USA is because we wanna learn and add some change to our lives and at the same time contributing diversity to America. Some people think we are taking advantages of this country. In fact, we sacrifice more! Usually, we pay twice and even triple tuition than in-state students. The opportunities are earned by our hard work as well. We have to trying much harder to fit in this exotic culture and maintain our study performance. Because we believe in hard work will eventually give us a good future because this is United States of America, where miracles will keep happening here. Not to mention, immigrant is root spirit of this country. What makes this country strong is that here we believe in equality, talented people will always find their way to contribute here and to this country.
