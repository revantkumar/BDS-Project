Vote NO on any proposal to increase H-1B or permanent high-skilled foreign workers.

Vote NO on any proposal to increase H-2B low-skilled foreign workers.

I am for America! It is disgusting to watch our elected officials casting votes for bills that they have never read! It is disgusting to watch our elected officials cast votes for bills that more than half of American citizens are opposed to!
It is disgusting to watch our elected officials in both parties block our government from operating in the best interest of America! NOTICE..American voters will be watching your VOTES on H-1B & H-2B...if you vote against what the American people have sent you to do, then watch your back, because you will need to seek a different job for the next election.
If you don't believe this, then go look at the 2012, 2014, and 2015 elections, and take notice of all the new Republicans and Tea Party leaders that have taken the place of those that refused to look out for America's best interest.
