Support this proposal. Some comments saying foreign students are getting jobs from native Americans. I can not agree this. Many companies do not hire foreigners. Really small percent of international students can find a job. For my major, native students can find a job very easily.Usually, a company needs to pay more to hire a international due to the sponsorship. lower wage for international students is not true.You cannot blame foreigners for those people who are losing jobs. People won't lose jobs if there are no foreigners in America?
