I strongly support the OPT 24-month extension. Some comments are talking about their kids graduating from college and failing to find job. However the OPT extension is not for college graduates, it is for master and PhD students. The international master and PhD students are the most talented young people from their own country. They have contributed tremendously to the US scientific community during their master and PhD education. Twenty years ago, Chinese college graduates came to US for PhD and most of them stayed and many of them became prestigious university professors. Nowadays the number of PhD students who stay has declined significantly. Why? Because China has initiated many programs to attract talented people to go back with generous support. Those programs also attracted some young researchers from countries other than China. If US failed to provide eligible status and necessary support for talented international students, it will gradually lose its leading role in the world.
