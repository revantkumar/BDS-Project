Bill Feross As a software engineer in Bay Area, I believe if this proposal die, the IT industry will die. 

Every year more than 5 college students are hired as our new software engineers and size of our company is not large, only about 40-50 until now. Usually only 1-2 among these 5 guys are U.S. citizens. We treat these newbies the same no matter where they come from. Of course there is not do not any discrimination over Native Americans. Our hiring process is strict and fair, only the genius can join our company and until now most of them are international students from China, India etc. They told me OPT extension will help them to stay rather than get back home. 

Please think about this proposal for all the IT industry and the future of our USA. We need smart and talents rather than the trash from Mexico.
