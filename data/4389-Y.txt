I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:
1. It will benefit both US government and US companies since they can hire more talented and gifted students from all over the world, if the international students can get working permit extension.

2. The proposal of extension of OPT will give international students enough time to get the research project or work done since the research is always years long.

3. International students will make US competitive in the world. A lot of European countries are eager to attract more talented students to their countries. Since extension of OPT is a very heavy weight when they balance. This proposal makes US more attractive then others.
