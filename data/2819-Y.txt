Well for starters I believe in equality. I think every organization deserves qualified candidates. Fortunately/ unfortunately whatever way you want to say, most of the international students come to the united States for higher education (Masters or PhD) which definitely contributes to the growth of any organization and in turn helps making united States technology sector what it is today. I would definitely like the Americans to get a job also, but at same time, I would want them to become equally qualified also. I hear people being in debt time and again, but that's how parenting and banking sector work here. Parents stop supporting their children at a very early age making them going through debts cycle, but I think this is a topic of disxussion for some other day. Thus, I do support this rule, and I believe organizations are doing their bid in hiring and giving Americans fair and equal opportunities. Period!
