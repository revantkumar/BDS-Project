I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

In the first place, by expanding training opportunities for international students with STEM degrees, the university could attract more competitive students. Because most of the top students choose to go to America because they could have enough time to do their research and get more working experiences in the famous company. So it is completely necessary for them to have the expanding training opportunities. For example, my brother graduated from Peking university, one of the top university in China. He got offers from Imperial College and UC Davis. Finally, he chose to go to UCB for further study even without any scholarship. The reason is that his major---electrical engineering requires internship to put theory into practice. Therefore, he got lots of experience by the opportunities of OPT.

Besides, this proposal can also be conducive to increasing the job opportunities and salaries for local people. Because this opportunity means that numerous students could live longer in America. They would spend their money renting a house, buying food and travelling, which naturally enhance the development of the service industry. Local people can have more opportunities to cooperate with students, thus living a better life.

Finally, this opportunity is necessary for most technical company. As is widely acknowledged, America is famous for its highly-advanced technology. In this time, students with STEM degrees would definitely provide these company with fresh blood and amazing ideas.So both technical companies and these students are eager for such a chance for cooperation.
