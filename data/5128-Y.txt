I strongly support the rule of expanding optional practical training for F1 students. Apart from the benefits for F1 students, if this rule passed, it will also be a huge advantage to the US economy and technology. International workers and scholars are playing important roles in the US industry and academia, and they have made great contribution to prosperity of the US economy. With the extended OPT program, F1 students, many of who are financially supported by US colleges and universities, have more opportunities to make contribution to US. The concern that this rule will reduce the opportunities of US citizens is unnecessary, because the international STEM workers are actually helping the development of the high-tech industries in US, thus creating more opportunities for Americans, not only in STEM areas, but also in many others such as finance industry and service industry. If the rule is not passed, many companies will be affected and it will be a great loss to the entire US society.
