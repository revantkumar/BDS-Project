I agree with this OPT extension: 

1) It will help the United States to attract the most talented people in the STEM field as we know most stem major advanced degree holders are from foreign countries. To give them the chance to work for U.S. Companies will help to boost the economy and create more job opportunities. 

2) Unlike the illegal immigrants, those STEM major students should be treated differently. They can bring fresh blood to the technology innovation, foster the scientific breakthrough, etc., which are what we need for our current generation.
