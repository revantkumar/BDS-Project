I STRONGLY support STEM OPT extension for a lot of reasons. Just to name a few of them below:
1: 24-month STEM extension will definitely attract more talented international students to come and contribute to both US universities and businesses, which again is a key factor to keep US universities and businesses active, innovative, and globally competitive.

2: STEM OPT extension can greatly enhance both the quantity and quality of US workforce in those important majors, and increase the US tax income, which are important for US's economy and society stability.
