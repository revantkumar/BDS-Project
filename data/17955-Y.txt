This proposal is good for both nonimmigrants and US citizens. After years' study, F1 students need the opportunities to convert their knowledge from school to abilities for the real society. Especially in the area of frontier edge technology, they are the striking soldiers, creating more job opportunities for US citizens. They are not illegal immigrants. Any ideas of blocking them is not good for US. There are not enough US citizens qualified for the existing high-tech jobs. Even blocking F1 students, US will get nothing but losing the competitive power all over the world. Then job opportunities will decrease and so the US citizens will be harmed. The greatness of US relies in a large part on the contributions of foreigners. Please be smart. Let it pass.
