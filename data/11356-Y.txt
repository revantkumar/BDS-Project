I support the STEM rule. To be fair, the STEM rule is a "win-win" strategy for both US and international students. The STEM rule will be a great attraction for foreign skilled student to apply to US universities. Therefore the technologies industry in US can thrive on the continuously competitive candidates market. Those US citizens who only looking at "protecting" their own work opportunities are actually lowing the bar of US education and professional training and will literally make US tech industry less competitive thorough out the world in the future.
