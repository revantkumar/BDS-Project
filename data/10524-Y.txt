I am a currently working in a public IT market research company and I know exactly how important it is to give international students the time and opportunity to work. Also I can't imagine how my company will be if there is no F1 student working here. As the chance to gain H1B slot is very low, it's very critical to the country as well as millions of company to sustain a longer time that stem students can work.
