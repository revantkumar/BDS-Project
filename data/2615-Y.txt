I strongly support the extension of OPT. 

The most important reason why I choose the States to further my study is that I can work in the States for a period of time after graduation. I think this is the unique advantage of the States. For international students, the most important factor of choosing school is whether they can find a job abroad. Because working experience is more important than classes in university. If students can not work to get experience and sharp their skills, most of them will choose other countries, suck as Australia and Canada, to save money. 

What's more, it is ridiculous that some people said that international students are taking jobs from domestic citizens. We have to inform these people that the government has restricted foreigners to find a job in the field of STEM in America. So the real reason why the unemployment rate is so high is that there are no enough engineers in the States. And we all know that most domestic citizens are not qualified enough to work in the field of STEM. So cutting the extension of OPT wouldn't help reduce unemployment of American, but might cause decline of economical development.
