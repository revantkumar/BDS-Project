I support the expansion of OPT program. 
I believe that bringing more talented people to America will benefit our country in the long run. 
This country has been talking about immigration reform for too long, and it's time to make things happen. 
Our politicians put so much time talking about issues with illegal immigrants, while our system does so little for those educated people who try to stay here legally. This is ironic indeed. 
Many high skilled foreign stem workers get paid much higher than the average salary, and they contribute to our country in various ways. They work for high tech companies that push forward the most advanced technologies. They are involved in important research projects that can change our everyday life. And unlike the prevailing misconception here, they pay more tax than average Americans do. 
A lot of international students come here to pursue advanced degree and have invested heavily financially for their future. They often come from highly educated family, and are not willing to compromise for low paying jobs here. After all, education is not about making big fortune, it is about living with dignity and following the passion. So let them stay and contribute with dignity, instead of kicking out all the engineers, scientists, and doctors.
