This rule is absolutely beneficial for both the U.S. and the skilled international students, and I strongly support this! The OPT extension rule can encourage more talented international students to come to US for further study because of the job opportunities coming along with this rule. And this will in turn ensure the general competitiveness of U.S. academic sector, by the financial support from the foreign students tuition payment and the great achievements of these international students. 
Besides, in addition to contributing to the industries relevant with the STEM fields, the large amount of living expenses of these international students also improve the local economy in U.S.
Of course, there are many other advantages of this extension rule, and I just cant agree more with it.
