Anonymous It is time for Americans to speak on behalf of our ignored policies and political procedures. If this Country has noone standing on the laws of our Nation, we will soon have no Nation. In an effort to help others from foreign countries, we have short-changed our own young Americans entering the workplace. It appears that many of our elected Legislators are submitting to "what is right in their own eyes" and for their personal gains, while ignoring the desires of those whom elected them to stand up for America and the future of this Country. I oppose The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau's Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for all eligible F-1 Students. I am disappointed in those elected Legislators who are incapable of complying with current legislation, yet run for an office making claims "For The People". It is time to represent The People of this Country, those who have entered our Country legally, and to either comply with, or change legislation by Due Process instead of blatantly ignoring our current laws.
