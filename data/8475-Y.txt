I strongly support this proposal for 24 mouths OPT extension. In STEM majors the majority students are international students, when they graduate, they become valuable work force for most tech companies. Without OPT extension, a good amount of them who lose the H1b lottery has to leave their job and leave US. Then the money spent on recruiting, training are all wasted. And the job vacancy is still to be filled with other students in STEM majors, which are also mostly international students. This would be a total waste of time and money for all the parties, and no one would actually benefit from it. Without this new OPT extension policy, tech companies would start more recruiting campaigns abroad, to attract STEM major students studying in other country, because by then US would be much less competitive to attract international students. So by then not only tech companies need to pay for it, but education and tourism as well.
