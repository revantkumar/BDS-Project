American workers first. The American born young people that I am personally aware of in my community struggle to find jobs of ANY kind. I am speaking of people in the 18-30 year old age bracket. These young people are smart and willing/wanting to work. There are also countless middle aged and older Americans in my community who are employed in jobs that cannot possibly sustain a decent, healthy lifestyle. 
It is way past time to address the needs of AMERICAN workers. YOU people(in government) have caused our employment problems by allowing millions of manufacturing jobs to leave the country due to your corporate enriching free" trade" deals. You then add insult and further injury with YOUR open borders policy and job stealing illegal immigrant treason. 
I/we have had enough of the knife in our back. It is time to stop twisting it and take it out.
