Jessica Qian I strongly support this new opt extension rule. It provides those international students and researchers great chances to bring what they learnt or researched in practice. This is a very important reason that most of the brilliant students choose US colleges instead of European or Asian ones to pursue their graduate degree. Without this rule, the US colleges will be less attractive and the nation will lose the chance to get those talented people who may make huge contributions to this country in the future. There are a few international employees in my company. I have to say they are really competitive. They also bring diversity into the company's cultural, which inspires people a lot in getting creative idea. It will be a pity if we can not keep them here.
