I strongly support the new rule. Every high tech company in United State is crying for more qualified employees, and a major source is killed by current visa policies. Therefore, extending the opt stem extension to 24 months not only providing more time to train and learn for STEM students but also providing more talents to the high tech companies in America. 

I know there are some American misunderstand that foreign students take away their job opportunities, benefits, pay no tax, etc. Yes, it is true that foreign/OPT student do not have to pay SS and Medicare, but in other words, they get no benefit from SS and Medicare at all. So, do they really bring a lot of harm to American? Besides, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce,
international students contributed more than $27 billion to the U.S. economy. Thus, while thinking of how much foreign students have taken away, please also think of how much they have contributed to United State. 

Although some people are so worried that this new rule will decreased their job opportunities, please think deeply that if OPT students really the main cause of unemployment. Well, if there's no more foreign student working in US, does it mean every American will get a job? I believe most of the companies are seeking for talents rather than cheaper labor so I don't think this rule will have a big impact to the unemployment rate in United State. 

Cultural diversity is needed in every single industry and same as in United State.
