I am currently working in automotive industry and would like to share I comments. The auto industry is getting back on its feet after the financial crisis, so we are recruiting more and more people. I found it difficult to find suitable employee from the candidates if I ignore all the international students. I mean, why would you be limiting them for working opportunities? We are a country of freedom! If they could only work for one year, I would not employ them because the training cost is too much.
