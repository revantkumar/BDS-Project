Robert Schmidt Dennis Graham,

I am not sure if the OPT extension will be beneficial to Americans but your comment seems ridiculous(Sorry, I have to say that.). I am a general manager of an IT company. We need young software engineers no matter where they born. If you do not have outstanding skills to get promotions to a secure position before getting aged, youngsters definitely will impact your job even if there are only Americans in the job market. So please stop using your personal issues, which will make other objectors' comments also doubtful.

Robert
