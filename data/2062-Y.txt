Anonymous Chen We all know that US's economy development today strongly relies on high-tech industry, and the demand for corresponding talent is also increasing. Nonimmigrant student, studying STEM related fields, as a kind of valuable human resources, should be fully used to consolidate the foundation in STEM. In addition, most of them work as intern can be relatively basic position, which most U.S citizens would less willing to do, so the competition in these fields can be limited. Meanwhile, even shorten OPT would release the pressure of employment in US born citizens, but reduce the average competence in workers due to less competition (In fact lot of nonimmigrant students learn that the hard way), which industrial business would not like to see. In the long run, due to less chance to explore high-tech industry international students would have less interest in applying US universities, which would reduce the proportion of education income (an important aspect of educational income) and loose and lost the stable source of new employees.
