I AGREE with the OPT extension! Because if the students can get the extension, they can work for a long time after they find a job. We know that if companies wants to explore a project they needs generally about several months! If the people whoo didn't get H1B and have to go back to their own country, which will influence the company. What's more, in America there are a lots of companies needs the graduate students whose major is STEM. They can help the develop of this area!
