Russell Allen I am opposed to the Proposed OPT Expansion...and here's six important reasons why:

First: There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree.

Second: There are about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties, many of whom would return to those fields with appropriate incentives.

Third: The OPT foreign workers will displace graduating Americans who are struggling to repay massive student loans.

Fourth: By turning the F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas, DHS is doing an end run around Congressional limits on H-1b 3-year work visas.

Fifth: There are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas, yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields.

And Sixth: Big Tech lobbyists have spent over $1 billion seeking immigration increases, but Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are laying off tens of thousands of employees.

In summary, America has an abundance of unemployed workers. We don't need to import more workers for tech jobs. Please stop big tech lobbyists from trying to circumvent the limit by expanding the Optional Practical Training Program.

Thank you
