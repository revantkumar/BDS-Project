I don't know why so many people don't have such common sense? If you have a company, say in LA, are you only hiring people from LA? If there's candidate with great skill from Boston, will you reject the candidate because he/she will take job opportunity away? To make US great again, we need to welcome talents from the world, OPT STEM students are legal, talented, skilled candidates who will pay tax and make contribution to US economy. Isn't this a obviously right thing to do?
