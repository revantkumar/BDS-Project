I am creating this comment to support the implementation of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students. As indicated by DHS, I believe this proposal will benefit both the relevant students and the US government, universities and the society. Students are in desperate need of sufficient professional training opportunities after they graduate from universities and colleges, and 1 year as it stands now will not guarantee this considering some will have to spend months seeking for jobs and adapting to the work environment. In terms of employers, I have met several principals and managers with architectural engineering firms during my interviews. They speak highly of international students who own satisfying educational and professional experiences, full commitment to work, and willingness to relocate or travel, but in the face of the uncertainty of OPT policy and the likelihood of canceling the STEM extension, they would avoid risks and offer only internship positions instead of full-time positions with benefits until things are getting clearer, which is a huge loss for the employers if the students refuse the offer due simply to this. Instead, companies will undoubtedly benefit from the improved skills of their international employees during the 3-year OPT session. For universities and colleges in the US, their admission will be subject to the policy as a large portion of students (in particular those who have earned bachelor degrees) regard the US as the ideal country to further their education in master programs since training opportunities are provided. With the shortening or even cancellation of the STEM extension policy, they are likely to turn to other countries for less time-consuming and cheaper education programs, which will have negative impact on the ability of this nation to attract students and professionals in relevant fields to study, work and contribute here -- not desirable in the long term for the US government which
