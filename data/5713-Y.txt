Ray Chris I strongly support this rule!

I am a U.S citizen, own a house which nearby RIT and University of Rochester, in recently years, most of my tenants are international students. Some of them are now in the OPT term.

Since they rent my house, I could have my income and pay tax to my country.

I am sure that if you cancelled this rule, I will face the difficult to find tenants for my house!
