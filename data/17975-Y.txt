The STEM OPT is a very important aspect of American education. It not only makes the graduates available to the local companies and let them transfer their knowledge skills on to the practices followed in industry but also help the American institutions build a rich working alumni and thus facilitate research partnerships with their companies and job opportunities for the future graduates. I believe it's only beneficial that the graduates work for the local companies in their early career when they're more innovative, ready to take risks and the direct consequence of this will be better industry practices leading to new inventions and more start ups on the block, thus pushing the economy of America forward. Also during the early years of their career the graduates would form a strong alumni base and being in the same country as their alma mater they would feel a sense of belonging and thus the connection between them and the institutions would remain strong.
