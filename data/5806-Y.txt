Jennifer Lamie I definitely support this proposal. It will help USA keep top at technology and science field among the world, as more gifted STEM student will be attracted to US to study and research.

A lot of US citizens may worried about losing their own jobs. But the truth is most of citizens are not working in the tech/science/engineering field. The proposal clearly indicate that international STEM students can only work in fields related to their major, which makes sure those students contribute their intelligence to the high tech industry.

As US job market is recovering - in Nov 2015, 271,000 new jobs are added to the market, and the unemployment rate is down to the edge of 5%. Therefore it is not reasonable to say that jobs market are shrinking, or all the jobs should be saved to local citizens. Thus I would strongly support this proposal for the future of USA.
