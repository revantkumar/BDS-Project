I Strongly SUPPORT this policy. As a senior software engineer, I have several talent and smart developers who are international students under OPT period, all of them are perfect and efficient. That is why I want them to stay here and I can have better performance when meeting with my manager. If they do not have extended OPT, I need to spend more time to hire a lot of fresh guys, which means I need to pay more efforts on the recruiting and my performance will become worse. My manager will definitely be unhappy to me.

Someone claims that we need to create more opportunities for U.S. citizens. Sure, I am willing to do that, but could more US citizens choose to learn Computer Science major? I promise that I will recruit every citizen applicant but it is still not enough. 

Please extend their OPT period...
