Strongly disagree with proposal which in effect gives priority to foreign students toward gaining jobs in the USA!!! I recognize the value of encouraging foreign students with STEM degree to remain in our country, but absolutely disagree with any government plan which puts American citizen students at a disadvantage in being hired when competing for employment with foreign nationals in this country on any toe visa!!! What happened to the "government of the people, by the people and for the people?" Was it replaced with, "our government favors foreigners, to include lawbreakers and potential terrorists being allowed to enter the USA as "refugees" who are mostly unaccompanied makes of warfighting age, and the only thing this government gives to its legal citizens is higher taxes to pay for all the benefits and advantages it is pouring out on non-Americans.... Enough is enough.....
