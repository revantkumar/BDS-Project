I strongly support this proposal as it will give Americans more job opportunities rather than reducing them. A significant amount of international students start their own businesses or invest in enterprises after graduation - this does not only create more job opportunities for Americans but also raise the technology level and productivity for the entire labor force. We shouldn't let them leave because of their nationality; instead, we should keep them as a productive part of the labor force. Famous international entrepreneurs like Elon Musk was once an international student struggling with work visa as well and Instagram almost lost one of its co-founders, Mike Krieger because of student work visa issue. I think international students should be given the same opportunities as everyone else in the country to get proper training from their employers and excel in workforce to contribute to our economy. Equality is one of the basis of our society which has always allowed our country to grow and prosper. We should welcome diversity in the workforce and give the international students an opportunity that they deserve.
