As a beneficiary of OPT extension, I strongly support this rule. I got my master's degree last year and I have been working for General Motors for almost one year in Detroit. It has been a very productive year, get several important products released. I've been absorbing knowledge from my team, which contains both native American citizens and international coworkers with H1-B visa and OPT. I was graceful for this opportunity, not only because I get the change to join this great team, but also get to know a better and loving city, Detroit.

When I was deciding to pursue a masters degree, I had a lot of options. There are so many great universities all over the world, with amazing culture, best facilities, great resource. But I chose to come to USA. I deeply believe that this is an magic country, it's freedom, democracy, diversity, equally treat men and women strongly attracting me. Every good side of this country tells me this is the right decision. I wanted to pursue better education, I wanted to have a fair opportunity to compete with men and women, from all over the world. Now these dreams all come true, and I hope the future international students can also experience these, fight for their opportunities and make more contribution to this world.
