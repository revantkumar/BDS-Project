I came to this country as an immigrant in 1959. Now I am an American citizen, and have served as an assistant professor in a Mennonite Seminary, also now teach as an adjunct instructor. I have met F - 1 students from various countries, South Korea, Japan, China, Burma, and various African countries. All of them were in training for ministry, were hardworking, and trustworthy. To extend the time they can stay for training opportunities is a kind and wise decision.
