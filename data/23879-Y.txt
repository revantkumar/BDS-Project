I am all for this new proposal. I don't like the implementation of the mentoring program since it might make some start-ups and small technology business reluctant to hire international talent. Moreover it's always assumed that each employee has a development plan and seeks mentorship and training in his employment through the actual work experience without necessary needing a program to support it.

I am totally for the additional 24 months STEM extension but again I would loosen the mentoring requirements. 

I hope this rule is implemented as soon as possible and that measures are in place to ensure the process is smooth and easy.

Technology business more than any other companies need talent and would benefit greatly from hiring international talent.
