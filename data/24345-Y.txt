I am a recently graduated international students. As we all known, applying H1B is really hard these days and not every company willing to take the risk to sponsor international student. However, we still have right to work after graduate because of OPT. Normally, students graduate in May or June, then they will spend at least 2~3 months to find a job. After they get into a new company, it would be around the end of the year. And the deadline for applying H1B is April which means international students only have one or two if lucky chance to apply H1B or they will be send back to their country. This is a loss of talent and definitely a loss of resources. Most international student study abroad with scholarship which means they got invested during school. But if they can't stay in US or at least work here, all the investment were gone. 
I hope OPT can be extended.
