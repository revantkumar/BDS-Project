Many outstanding students could contribute their professional knowledge to the US and largely improve the economic growth, especially in the engineering field. 
The extension time could save the US company expenses on visa sponsorship fees, and allow the companies enough time looking for the best employee. 
The extension would do no harm to more immigrants, since outstanding students could secure job within one year of graduation, while if students could not, there is little possibility for them to find jobs during the extension time. The extension time would be just the time when more students live in the US for a short period, and send money into the US and contribute to the economy. Without a job, after the graduation, they will come back to their home country. 
During the extension time, many students without a job would do some part-time job as a cheap labor to some extent, while contribute their professional knowledge to the companies, especially small companies, and even volunteer work. This is definitely a benefit for small companies who are lack of money for sponsorship, but also need professionals.
