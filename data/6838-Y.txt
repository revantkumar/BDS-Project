Shufang Guo I strongly support this new rule! 
There are many different engineering and science fields OPT holders get hired such as chemistry, biological-genetic development, materials or mechanical engineering .... NOT JUST IT. If there is no OPT program most talented foreign students in advanced degree levels will go to other countries and this will dramatically affect the US university research. Additionally, US universities may be one of the most expensive ones among all the higher educational programs all over the world. But why these foreign students are willing to bear such a heavy burden and come to this country to study? Having a high level competition and talent pool in US universities is what makes it the best in the world! Another important reason is our excellent OPT rules, these practical training opportunities are as important as classroom learning. Without OPT, US will lose these students-researchers-professors, which would lead to a big disaster. US universities would eventually become mediocre and US science and technology field would collapse.
