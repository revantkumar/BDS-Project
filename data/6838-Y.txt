I strongly support the extension of OPT to 24. I consider this extension as one of the best way to let america become america again. There are a large number of talented international student want to show their talent to the US. Isn't it a good thing for this country? We can see that a lot of Europe country start to attraction more and more international to study and work for them after graduation. When they want to do this? Become they want to make their country be the same strong as US. I have to say that Europe has even higher population density than the US. They suppose to take care more about the job opportunities for their citizens, but they didn't do that. Why they didn't limit the chance of international student to work in their country recently, because they find out that the hiring rate even get higher than before for the local citizens. One of the example is Germany. We all know that the get through a relatively tough financial period after World War II. But they do get a economical boost for the recently 10 years. How these happened. Because more and more international students start to work for them. They provide their talented and special ideals to the old country and make the whole country get used to a new way to make a life. The called this phenomena as the industrial revolution two. Besides Germany, more and more Euro countries start to tried to use international student to change their country make them strong. If the whole Euro get raised again. I have to say it is not a good thing. They have already controlled a high percentage of the mechanical world. If they start to control the electrical world, it is tough to say of US can keep their leading place in the high tech world. For making the US keep as the top country, please let the OPT extension to 24 months. For talent, For money and for our great US!
