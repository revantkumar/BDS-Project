Sarah Ouyang I strongly support the proposed rule for the following reasons: 
1. Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes and their Tuition. At rate of $100,000 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $40,000,000,000) will go other countries with OPT system.
As for taxes, Total taxes paid by stem students is 2 Years x $5000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 4,000,000,000

2. International stem students not only contribute to US Economy growth but also create job opportunities for US Citizens. I work at Wallethub. Our CEO was an international student also. He is Greek and he came all the way from Greece to the US to study Civil Engineering and Economics. Eight years ago he started his own company in US which generated million dollar revenue per year. Most of my co-workers are Americans. I believe there are hundreds of thousands of international entrepreneurs in the US that are contributing to this country.

To sum up, I'm strongly supportive to the proposed rule.
