Nowadays, more communications and work are carrying on among different countries. As an international students, I am glad that I have the opportunity to be here--to learn, to share my culture with the natives, and more importantly, to be employeed as a research assisstant to investigate related topics in food safety area.
American is a country of freedom, I do appreciate this. This helps me devote myself to the lab projects here. Also, I believe my ability, especially the research ability could make contribution to American food safety area, to the projects in my lab, as well as for my own publications.
According to the above reasons, I support this policy.
