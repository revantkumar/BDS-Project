I strongly support this rule. After learning for 2 years in the US, I am doing a project with my mentor and I am currently in OPE EXT. If the bill can extend the period to be 24 month, it helps me a lot to finish my project, which is funded by the professor. Also it is part of the taxpayers contribution. Pls let it pass.
