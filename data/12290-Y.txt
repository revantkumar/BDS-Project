I strongly agree with the new policy that OPT should be extended for 24 Months for All Eligible F-1 Students. First of all, it's beneficial for the entire high-tech industry based on Silicon Valley, that recruiting large amount of STEM program students with OPT extension. Secondly, considering future trend of big data, USA will need large amount of Data scientists and mathematician to help in all industries (financial service, market research and high-tech). That means OPT extension of 24 month will help USA attract more talents in all of these areas. Lastly, a fast development of US economy will give US gov more funds to build up infrastructure and solve more social problems, e.g. better education facilities, aging problem, etc.
