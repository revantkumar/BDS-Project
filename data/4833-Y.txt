I strongly support the OPT extension.

International students contributed a lot the US economy. According to NAFSAs latest economic analysis. International students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year. Most of that comes from the tuition and fees and living expenses the international students paid during the stay, opt extension will keep attract the international students to choose US high education and contribute to the US economy.
