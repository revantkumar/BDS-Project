I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Lots of international students come here to learn our technique in our top universities. We need to keep them here for several years or at least 2 years to contribute to the country, so that US can keep leading position in the world.

2. It is a 'WWW' world now. Most of companies hire their employee through Internet and it is open to the world. Salary is also same and 'open'. There is no difference between international students and urban students. 

3. All companies want to grow up aggressively and earn much more money. They just want to hire most ideal employee which can help them. They know spending money in hiring may bring them much more. So they just want to get the most ideal candidate, no matter urban or international.
