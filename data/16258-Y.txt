I strongly approve the OPT STEM extension. I work in a top tech company and also recruit college new grads by myself. We really need more qualified people in the industry! Even after considering those talented foreign students, we still find it's very hard to find enough people we want to hire to keep up with the speed that the company is growing. I can't believe if our choice is forced to be limited to only US citizens, how hard it would be for all tech companies to grow. Those people who are against the extension, please work hard on trying to improve your own skills to find a better job and stop blaming other people!
