I support the STEM OPT Extension for 24 months. This would greatly benefit the talented students and improve skills. It gives highly talented people to succeed and contribute to us economy. Many students leave their family and career to get the best education and to have a chance at better life skills. They should at-least be given an opportunity to improve their skills.
