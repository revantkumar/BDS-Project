Dick Young This proposed rule is simply a corporate welfare concession to high-tech employers who want cheap labor at the expense of American workers qualified to hold high-tech jobs. It is NOT in the best interests of either the American worker or American economic, industrial or political security to increase the number of foreign citizens having access to our high-tech processes or information. 

The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
