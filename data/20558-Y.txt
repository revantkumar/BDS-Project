I strongly support this proposal since not only foreign students but also native workers will benifit from it.Usually F1students take occupations which are too hard or too tedious for native workers.Without those diligent F1 studentscompany would suffer from economic losses and lead to cut off native workers to save budget.The extention of OPT will enable F1 students to work in American for a longer time and benifit both native worker and F1 students.
