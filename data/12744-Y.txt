As an American citizen, I'm in support of the OPT STEM extension. American universities attract the brightest minds in the world, and graduates from those universities go on to provide massive value for institutions here in the US. It wouldn't make sense to not give these extremely talented students whatever resources they need to stay on in the country and provide value for us. It is truly a win-win situation.
