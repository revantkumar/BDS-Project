"not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes."
"a 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Ins titute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors."
"Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields."
