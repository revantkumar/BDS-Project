During my internship in one of the biggest pharmaceutical business manager companies, I noticed that there are many international workers in the technology center, where require workers to have high level skills in analytics and data area. The reason why the company hire these international workers who are on H1B is because that it finds these people who majored in STEM are very strong at technical skills and very devoted to their jobs, which add great value to the company. Therefore, I believe it will be critical for America to keep these talents from leaving America in order to keep its leadership in the global economy.
