This is what happened to Disney workers who were terminated and had to train their replacements.

OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors.

OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.
