Dear Sir or Madam,

I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Many international students work very hard in college and most of them obtain great scores after graduation. The goal for the talented international students is to work in US right after graduation to make big contributions to US using what they learnt in school. 

2. Yes, competition does exists but this is critical to make America become better and better. Competition leads to pressure, pressure generates motivation to be better and this motivation makes US be the most powerful country in the whole world. Obviously, international students need H1B visa sponsor and compete with those whose native language is English. If they are able to find a job specially in a fortune 500 company, it is apparent that they do have the skill, talent or perks which can not be found in most domestic students generally.

3. Diversity is very important for the U.S which keeps America be stronger and stronger. Google CEO: Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO: Satya Nadella were both international students when they graduated and they indeed made great contribution to US specially technology field which matches STEM pretty well. Besides this, many international students work very hard as engineers and scientists to help to drive the American companies become successful!

Thank you!

Best Regards!
Chow Hong
