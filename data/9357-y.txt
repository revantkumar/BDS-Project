Robert Lee It is the DIVERSITY and INNOVATION that makes the US a world leader in the STEM area, and the extension will undoubtedly strengthen the leading position. The universities and colleges will be globally competitive in attracting the best STEM students among the world. And with more talented foreign student devoted into research and development work as the historic record suggests, STEM companies will accelerate their developments and eventually creating more job positions. I support the new OPT extension.
