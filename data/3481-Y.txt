I strongly support the OPT STEM extension proposal. I believe America is a nation that provides equity to every individual regardless of his/her nationality and race. This is what makes America the strongest country in the world right now. I believe Foreign students also have their rights to be educated, to pursue job opportunities, to compete fairly in industrial job markets, and to make contribution to United States development. Up till now, F1 OPT students have already made huge contribution to America's technology innovation and economic development. I believe this proposed rule will continue bringing huge benefits for both United States and F1 Students.

Thanks,
