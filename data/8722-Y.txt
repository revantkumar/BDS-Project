Making STEM major OPT extension to 24 months is very crucial to both international student and the U.S.

For international student:
1. Students come here to learn, and wish to apply the knowledge to the real work at U.S. STEM majors are not easy majors, students put effort in it and deserve a longer time to stay in U.S. and contribute more using the knowledge.

For U.S. Government:
1. If the extension gets approved, more talented international students would love to come to U.S. and study, which in the end, a lot of U.S. companies will benefit from getting smarter people from all over the world.

2. U.S. values diversity. If the extension couldn't get approved, it will lose thousands of talented people, leaving this country. STEM majors are not easy majors, all industries need this kind of talented people. If these people left, it would cause a big lose to U.S., directly affecting the economy of U.S.

3. Less international students would come to U.S. To study. A lot of universities would have less tuition income and would cause a great lose for keeping the campus running, keeping good professors to stay. In the end, it's still a totally lose of talents to the entire country.

In a word, the extension is super necessary and reasonable.
