QI LU I agree with STEM OPT extension with several reasons. First of all, STEM OPT extension will increase domestic consumption and stimulate American economic development. It will not influence the employment opportunity of local citizen and residents because the OPT extension only suitable for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students. In converse, the field of STEM is lacking of labor and the demand of STEM employee keeps increasing for recent years. International students will make contribution to the shortage STEM labor market as well as release the conflict between STEM and other industrial fields. In addition, STEM OPT extension for international students will attract more international students to study in U.S., which make great contribution to the high level education for U.S. as well as broadcast the reputation of U.S. university and college worldwide. It shows the culture tolerance of U.S. culture and increase the revenue for universities and colleges. In this case, the benefits of STEM OPT extension will override the disadvantage.
