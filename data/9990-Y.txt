It is a great rule to expand training opportunities for F-1 stem students! So far US attracts the most talented STEM students from all over the world, who in turn become the most well-trained workers that are the key force to drive the innovation, growth, and competitive strength of US economy over other countries. It would be a huge loss for the country if the STEM OPT extension is revoked or shortened, many most talented workers will be forced to leave US and go back to serve their home countries. For example, the government and many research funding institutes (DARPAR, NSF, and so on) have been supporting STEM PhD students doing cutting edge research for decades, most of whom are F-1 students. It would be ridiculous to spend so much money in training those smartest people in the world for 5+ years, and then send them back to their home countries after they finish the training and get ready to be the best workforce for US. Why not keep those best workers we could find in the world in US and serve the growth of US? The new STEM OPT rule is a great solution to help keep best STEM workers in the country.

Even though the country has been promoting STEM training, US is and will be still very short of workers with STEM degrees in the upcoming years, who are the key force to drive innovation and growth of US economy. The new rule just helps to satisfy the need of high quality STEM work force in US, and helps US to maintain its competitive strength over other countries. The new rule simply reflects the open culture of US since its birth, which is the key element that makes US unique and more and more powerful.
