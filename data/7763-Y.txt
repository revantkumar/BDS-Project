J Lee I think I got some words to say. What excuses that people used to persuade the government to ban the STEM extension? Taking the jobs from us? Come on, if you don't qualify a position, you'll never deserve it. It has nothing to do with STEM extension, stop using that excuse. What makes the U.S. so powerful in only 239 years? People, intellectual human resources. America is a nation of immigration, people came here with various cultural background. They work hard, overcome more difficulties than you thought, and now you are saying "no, you have to leave to your own land, I don't care how much contribution you could make," that is not good for our country. On the other hand, is it really gonna bring more benefits to the America if we ban the extension? Thinking about competition, competition boosts everyone's potential energy; competition generates innovation, creativity. What do we want as a whole nation? We want to keep the dominant position in the world, we have to absorb all the smart intellectual human resources. It's never a wrong thing to have elites. I am not sure if banning the extension could raise the chance of being employed, but I can predict that we'll lose the long-term treasure. Thinking about the nation as a whole, do what favors us.
