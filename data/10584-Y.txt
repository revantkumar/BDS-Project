I personally feel that a wise decision is made in the proposed new stem opt rule. It really helps students to gain more practical knowledge and contribute to the technical companies. It also opens up the scope of wide opportunities for foreign students to pick USA as a place to study and practice stem programs. We as students would really appreciate a proposal like this which would help us to implement all the theoretical knowledge gained in universities. 

In short I would say a YES to the proposed new stem opt rule which would help thousands of students to contribute towards technological success.
