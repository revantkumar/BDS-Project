I strongly support the new OPT extension rule! This is a rule directly tells people why the United States is a great country. More importantly, this is the rule which directly helps the United States maintain its advantage in technology, economy and in preserving culture diversity, which in turn ensures the United States to be a great country. 

There are a huge number of talents from all around world come to US to learn the most advanced and cutting-edge knowledge and skills. We came here not only because the US has all the educational resources we desire, but also because its openness (such as allowing people to work here using OPT after graduation) allows us to apply our knowledge and skills here. Substantial contributions have been made by International students who are enabled to work here by the great OPT policy. There is no doubt that those contributions helped the US maintain its leading position in technology and science in the world. 

Now the DHS has come to a cross road of whether to grant more convenience for international students to devote themselves here or to put a barrier on the way in which international students contribute to the US. Which way should be chosen? The answer is obvious. 

As an international student with a STEM background studying in Carnegie Mellon University. I strongly support the new OPT extension rule because I have seen so many benefits brought to both international students and the US society by the OPT. As more and more talents of the whole world assembles here every year attracted by the new OPT policy, the generated social wealth will definitely be enormous. Please proceed with the new OPT extension policy for the benefit of all!
