Immigrants are making great contributions to this country, and the original purpose of this OPT program is to keep the talented students for science research & technology development. I cannot believe if we vacate this rule what will happen on those high-tech companies like Google, Microsoft etc. To sack those high tech workers home will in a short time cause panic for those companies, which may the economic worse. Also, if the number of foreign students reduce largely because of this, we are losing more money, because many of them not only come here to pay tuition, they also do shopping, traveling etc.
