I strongly support extending OPT! Not only because I am a international student, but also I believe this policy will benefit the US society in the long run.
Currently I am working as an IT administrator at a trading company. Before I came there are two American people work in this dept. After I came they both find higher pay position from other companies, now I am working with two positions here, I am getting a pay check which is less than any of the previous two persons have. But I am very happy working here, because I believe this is the blessing from God. And I will continue to work here for a long time. 
I didn't take any Americans' work opportunities, instead I am making contributions to this industry. With my contributions, workers here are experiencing a better work environment!
Keep it up, OPT extension!!!
