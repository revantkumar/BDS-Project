OPT STEM extension is necessary and important for foreign F1-students. This helps them in getting practical experience which will enhance their education obtained in USA.

Only 1 year will not be sufficient to find a position and learn any new skills or techniques. Therefore, STEM extension is really necessary.

I strongly recommend the 2 year STEM extension.
