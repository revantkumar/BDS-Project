This proposal should definitely been approved.

it is not true that foreign students/workers can get jobs easily, they have to go through rounds of interviews and need to have more skills than local people. That means it is even harder for them to get jobs when competing with Americans.

besides, a certain degree of competition is necessary for this country. and the benefits brought by the competition would be enjoyed by every American people.
