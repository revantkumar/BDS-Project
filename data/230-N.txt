This proposal will do more harm than good. Put American workers first and end this proposal immediately. You should be ashamed of yourselves. I propose you investigate the people who wrote this proposal and decide what their true motives are. There are millions of qualified American workers that are out of jobs. You should refocus and change your proposal. Provide big incentives to employers who hire and train Americans first. In fact, we should change your proposal to penalize employers who hire foreign workers first. Fine employers that don't even try and find qualified American workers. Your proposal is very, very harmful. Shame on everyone who contributed to your proposal. It's a disgusting piece of work. It will hurt American businesses, workers, and students. This proposal does nothing for American workers. When will you ever understand? Put America first.
