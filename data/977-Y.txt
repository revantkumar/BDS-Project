Without improving and expanding OPT, thousands of F1 students will lose their work opportunities in US. But it will be a great lose for both the companies and the US society. 
This will also cause the decrease of future international students. For many US universities, they will lose the tuition income because of the decreasing of the number of international students. For the US, they will lose those great talented human resource. 

Thus I strongly support the OPT expanding proposal.
