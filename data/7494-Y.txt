Joy Lee I totally support the proposal for several reasons:

1. Government should let international student to work here after they achieved their degree. Practice is the best way to improve your ability. One year is not enough to finish one big project, which is usually making big contribute to US society.

2. Second, competition can help people improve themselves. Someone citizens may say that they cannot find a job because of our international student, which is really ridiculous. Jobs are offered for the best candidate, if you are good enough, why are you afraid you cannot find a job? Thanks to the competition, everyone will work harder to improve themselves, and improve the society at the same time. 

Thus, to extend the OPT is really a good decision in order to make the society stronger and richer.
