I strongly support the new OPT extension rules. Allowing international students who received American degrees in the STEM fields to practice their professional skills in a working environment is crucial to their education experience in the US. The OPT extension rules will greatly help the students to cultivate their all-round capabilities relating to their careers. The new OPT extension rules are not only beneficial to the nonimmigrant students, they also help America to grow and improve. During the OPT period, the young students will contribute to the US economy and technology with their knowledge, expertise and creativity which make America a successful country. Since OPT and OPT extension are only temporary working permits, and the OPT extension only applies to a certain group of international students, it will not harm the job perspective of massive US citizens. In fact, international students with STEM degrees are good supplemental human resources which America should take good advantage of instead of sending them away. In summary, I support the changes made on the OPT extension rules, and I hope it will get approved for the benefits of both America and STEM students.
