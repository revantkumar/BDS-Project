I strongly support the extension to be extended to 24 months. 

1. USA is a diversified country, and what makes the country great is its diversity and inclusion. Thus, the country not only needs people from all over the world to come to this land to study, but also need them to contribute what they have learnt. 

2. The world is a global economy. Allowing good talents to contribute themselves is a great way to keep the country competitive in a long run. 

3. If USA welcomes students to learn from different countries, the regulation must be made to be beneficial for these students as well. Especially for STEM field. 

4. This world needs to be competitive. It is not people from other countries fight for jobs with local residences. If you are good enough, you will always get a job. If you are blaming other people for being too competitive, then it becomes your problem for being easily replaced.
