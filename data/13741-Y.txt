I SUPPORT the proposal. The new OPT extension proposal will bring numerous benefits to the country and the companies. International students on STEM majors have contributed significantly to the U.S economy especially within high tech fields these years. Specifically at Phd Level, only limited number of domestic students prefer to continue their study pursuing a doctor degree, which leaves companies not much choice on selecting qualified employees. The new proposal will give both companies and fresh graduates opportunities on choosing best employer/employees, thus will consequently put predictable positive effects on U.S. economy.
