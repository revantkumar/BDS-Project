I strongly support this proposal. Post-graduate training is as important as education itself. This is the rule that attracts lots of international students like me to study in United States. As a postdoc researcher, it takes at least 2-3 years to finish a research proposal (e.g. NSF or NIH). This includes developing technique, designing and carrying out experiments, analyzing data, writing up and presenting the discoveries. This could not be accomplished without the OPT extension.
