I abdolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. America is a country that could contain a variety of talents ,and most international students of STEM are full of talents and they should have the rights to stay longer in America .Students form Asia have a varity of talents and they are good at mathematics and analysis ,they could provide more power to the further development of America .
