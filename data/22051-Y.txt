I strongly support this proposal. 

It will benefit the whole country in the long run by allowing more foreign talents to work in the United States, especially in the STEM fields. STEM related jobs are big contributors to the development of the country. With the growth of the technology, economy and many other aspects of the social wellbeing, the whole population of the Unitied States will be benefited. 

This proposal also reflects the true spirit of the equal opportunities, which has been supporting the growth of United States and everyone living in this country. We shall embrace such spirit for a better future.
