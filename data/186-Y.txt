This is without a doubt, a step in the right direction to fix our broken immigration system. Lets do something for people who enter this country legally, pay huge tuition fees and before they leave should be able to contribute to our economy. 

International students contributed more than $27 billion to the U.S. economy, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.In 2014, the continued growth in international students coming to the U.S. for higher education had a significant positive economic impact on the United States. 

Open Doors 2014 reports that about 74 percent of all international students receive the majority of their funds from sources outside of the United States, including personal and family sources as well as assistance from their home country governments or universities. Students from around the world who study in the United States also contribute to America's scientific and technical research and bring international perspectives into U.S. classrooms, helping prepare American undergraduates for global careers, and often lead to longer-term business relationships and economic benefits. 

While our politicians are pushing for amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants, we must first focus on highly qualified legal aliens who are contributing in so many different ways. 

Thanks.
