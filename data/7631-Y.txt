I support the proposal for OPT extension. As an international student study in USA, I know that many research and projects taken in STEM fields are complicated and require a long time to finish. Without the extension, many projects will be stopped halfway. To keep the nation and its industry/academy remain competitive, its very essential to extend the OPT duration.

According to one article from Duke (http://today.duke.edu/2013/06/internationalengage), the existence of international students benefits the U.S. classmates, not only on campus but also long after graduation. The OPT extension is a way to attract more international students to study in America. Thats why I think this proposal should be supported.
