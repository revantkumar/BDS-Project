Lihui Wang I strongly support this proposed rule to allow international students to work here up to 36 months since it can benefit both international students and tech companies. 

For tech companies, they need international students to take those roles. It is known that international students have very good performance in those fields. Otherwise, those companies wouldn't have hired them. Not passing this proposed rule means that those companies would lose a lot of competitive labors in the tech market. And their business may start declining if this proposed rule fails. 

For international students, they need to find a job to cover the tuition and living expenses they spent during their study in US. As we know, that a lot of international students came to US with tuition loan from the government of their original countries. Besides, tuitions for international students are usually higher than citizens. It's hard to say that working here for only one year is enough for those students to earn the money back. Therefore, this extra extension would definitely relieve their finance situation.
