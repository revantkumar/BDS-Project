I am in strong support for this rule. I will tell you a number of reasons for me supporting this rule:
1) This will help US to retain the best of talents to stay and work for US companies, rather then gaining valuable knowledge here in US and then applying all the gained knowledge elsewhere in some other country. 
2) This rule is just allowing students to work for a US company for an extended 24 months, this in no way mean that the student will stay here as a possible immigrant. US has already proper immigration laws for a potential immigrant. 
3) People say that there will be a loss for Social Security in the tune of 1 billion $ per year, but this amount is nothing in terms of the number of dollars this students will contribute towards the economy of the country. 
4) US has been the epitome of innovations for decades. If you will not make student friendly laws, then not many students will opt for US at its destination for higher education. 
5) This, rule in no way will replace any of the jobs from American Workers. Most the the students with OPT are freshers with little or no work experience, and no company will want to employ these students in place of already experienced American Workers. 
6) There is also a possibility that these students after gaining valuable experience opt for higher education (Post Doc/Research) which is in a way retaining talent within USA.
7) Many H1B visa holders are against this rule, because they are worried that these students who already have better degrees will take up there jobs. 

It is to live the American Dream that students come here for there education. US has been the country of immigrants. It is for US to decide whether they want to retain them or not.
