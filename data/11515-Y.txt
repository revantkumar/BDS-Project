It indeed a very important problem that the best talents cultivated by our American universities cannot stay here to contribute to this nation just be because of this stupid regulation. We do not welcome refugees and homeless from other country, but we do need those talents that contribute to us tax system and our common companies. I totally agree with this new policy.
