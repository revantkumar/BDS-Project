I completely agree with new rule to extend stem period to 24 months. F-1 Students should be provided with the opportunity to work here. They are huge talent which can used by US for its own growth. See the likes of CEOs of Microsoft, Google etc who are once F-1 students leading the tech gaints. Removing the STEM would discourage foreign students to pursue higher education in US.
