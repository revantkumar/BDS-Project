I support to extend OPT for Accounting major.

Reason: Accounting major students prefer to have a CPA certificate when we apply for a job in any accounting firms. 
However, as an international student, CPA is not easy and it needs to take a whole year to attend exams which have four parts.
If the OPT period is extended, we can have more time to prepare the exams, and we have more opportunities to get offer.
Accounting needs experiences, so when we can stay in a big firm for a long-term, we can learn more experiences in the company.
