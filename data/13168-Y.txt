International students really need OPT extension to work in U.S. companies after they graduated from colleges or graduate schools. As we all know, STEM apply for those students who will work in technology areas in U.S. US also wants to leave those backgrounds students in engineering, computer science, data science and technology areas. Letting them stay in U.S. is a win-win activity. With the knowledge of these foreign students, it brings US companies thousands millions profit, or even more. Through the connection of these students, it is also a great opportunity for companies or government build global relationships to countries where these foreign students come from. STEM students' OPT extension has hundreds of benefits and zero hurts to US. There is no reason to stop this immagriation regulation which already benefits students and this country so many years.
