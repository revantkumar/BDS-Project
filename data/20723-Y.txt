I object to the provisions to increase the STEM OPT extension from 17 to 24 months. There is no reason why non-immigrant foreign students need to spend a total of 36 months undergoing OPT training, when their course of study is shorter than that in many cases. In addition, US students seem to be considered fully trained at the completion of their studies, so why do foreign students need this additional training?

The support for this provision is strictly to provide employers with a pool of employees that can be paid wages lower than what would be demanded by US employees who are apparently fully trained after the same amount of education.
