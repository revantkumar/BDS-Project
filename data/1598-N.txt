This is not about helping students from out of this country; get training before they go back to their own countries to work but a way for companies to get around not being able to get enough H 1 B visas to allow them to hire cheap labour!!! These students further use this as a way to stay and hopefuly get an H 1 B. Companies don't have to hire a permanent worker ie a US citizen worker and they also don't have to pay medicare and SS taxes which further saves them a ton of money and deprives medicare and SS of much needed monies.

We do not need the OPT program. We need companies hiring US citizens and permanent immigrants already here for jobs that pay fair wages and to which they are paying SS and medicare taxes on.

Furthermore; who is vetting these students before they get work permits? Who is keeping track of where they are? Who is keeping track of if they overstay their visas? and the list of issues goes on. DHS / USCIS did a bad job with the DACA kids vetting so we doubt you are going to do any better with these students.
