Let me start by stating how important immigrants are for the great power of the US. 

Look at the Google homepage doodle today http://www.google.com/doodles/hedy-lamarrs-101st-birthday . This lady was born in Austria-Hungary and later became a US citizen. According to Wikipedia, "the principles of her work are now incorporated into modern Wi-Fi, CDMA and Bluetooth technology".

The even more well-known figures: Albert Einstein, John von Neumann and many more. The technologies developed by these immigrants provide US with great advantages over other countries (consider the nuclear bomb and silicon valley, for example). 

The United States attracts talents. Many of them come to the US for higher education. If they show great talents and are recognized by companies and academia, US should provide better opportunities to keep them. Extending OPT will provide better opportunities for them to show talents, be recognized, and contribute to the technology development of the US.
