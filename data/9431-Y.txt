I would suggest to pass it for the flowing reasons:

Extension of OPT for STEM student will contribute to economy growth in US, especially for internet or technology related fields. Growth of US is largely rely on internet or technology related companies, while they lack enough well trained people to work for them. Extension of OPT will help those companies hire enough people for better growth and hence contribute to US economy. Also, extension of OPT will make US more attractive for international students, who contributes a lot to economy of US. Most of them didn't get any resources fro US government but pay a lot tuition and living expense in US.

Many people may worry that extension of OPT will take away American's job. But it is NOT true, since there are far more jobs in the market especially for STEM, but the companies cannot hire enough domestic people.
