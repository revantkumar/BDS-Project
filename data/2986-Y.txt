Priscilla Chavez Why do we encourage our children to go to college strive to be the best they can be and go after the American Dream and then stab them in the back by giving visas to foreign students to undercut American workers. American students graduating from our universities and going into the tech field don't have any chance when our own government is working against them. Priority should be given to American workers and the government should not be in the business of providing cheap labor to big corporations to undercut American workers.
