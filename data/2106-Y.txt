I strongly support the STEM extension for OPT students.

If students can work longer in the U.S after graduation, the employers can save a lot of money and resources. Employers usually give extensive training to new hires. If international students leave after one year of employment, companies have to re-hire people to fill in those positions and spend resources on training them while on the other hand those money and resources could well be saved if those OPT students were able to stay longer.
