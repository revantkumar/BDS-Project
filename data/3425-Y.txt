As an international student just finished my graduation education on computer science, we are capable to develop new systems, products and provide professional service for companies in this country. And we are actually the main reason that the information industry in US can keep growing like a rocket in such long a time. 

It is absolutely beneficial to offer us the extension authorization of OPT. By doing this, we are able to work in a more stable status, which means better quality, more creation and greater profits. At the same time, we consume here, we bring opportunities for food service, bank service; we helped community to improve the education, communication; we pay more tax so that there will be better public services like police, transportation, health; we build beautiful houses, and we make our selves new examples to courage more people to fight for their lives. I cannot enumerate all advantages because of we, the fresh, vigorous, hardworking and highly educated students, I just know for sure that we are the source of energy and creation, we are making this country better.

And actually it's government's responsibility to provide better policy and treat this as a national strategy since this country is always a nation of gathering the most talented people from all other places of the world. This is the soul of this country, isn't it? Without an open mind attitude, there won't be the USA today. I can never image any reason to deny this policy, personally I think it should be longer than 24 months. Let me tell those people who think we might take over their jobs: YOU SHOULD MAKE YOURSELF STRONGER INSTEAD OF COMPLAIN THIS POLICY. YOU SHOULD MAKE YOURSELF CAPABLE TO WORK WITH ME AND COMPETE WITH ME EQUALLY SO THAT YOU WON'T BE PART OF THE REASON IF THIS COUNTRY FALLS DOWN. ANY CLEAR MIND SHALL REALIZE THAT TO ENABLE AND EXTEND THE OPT AUTHORIZATION IS THE ONLY CORRECT SELECTION!!
