I am in support of extending OPT to 24 months for foreign national students. USA is a land of immigrants and in recent past foreign students have contributed immensely to economy. Many of the enormously successful companies like Apple, Google, Facebook have been started by first or second generation immigrants. This has created hundreds of thousands of jobs for US economy. Also, the younger skilled immigrants have contributed to the social security system which keeps the social security system better funded.
