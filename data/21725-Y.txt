I am against this rule for the following reasons,
1. A lot of students come on F1 visa just for the sake of entering the US and not for some high level education and research. They attend some low level universities and institutions many of whom are involved in visa fraud. Many of them were busted and are under investigation by USCIS & concerned authority right now. Giving OPT to each and every F1 student is not a proper rule.
2. OPT can be given to those who are really into cutting edge and high skilled fields and where American workers cannot fill the vacancies. This rule gives OPT to all students irrespective of vacancies in a particular industry or sector. As such, companies prefer to hire such candidates over American ones due to their (F1 OPT candidates) low cost to the company.
To conclude, I am against the rule of giving OPT to each and every student who completes a graduate education in US
