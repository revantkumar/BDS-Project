Based on my experience as a student majored in computer science, what we learned in college has huge difference than what is actually being used in the real world IT industry. Many of the text books used in the college mainly covers fundamental theory while the skill for preparing students to tackle real world engineering problem is placed on the back burner. Extension of OPT would help enable students receive enough field of training through many of the long term industry projects and help companies reduce the cost of rehiring people. Therefore, I hereby support to extent the OPT program.
