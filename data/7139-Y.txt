Aruna Wijeratne I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. Additionally, retaining educated people in US makes US the world leader in Science, Technology and thus the world economy.
