I am currently an international student on F-1 OPT STEM extension. I received by doctoral degree in Electrical Engineering from Washington State University. Since graduation I have been part of the development team in a software company that services the energy sectors in not only the USA, but in Canada, south-east Asia, EU and Middle East.

One criticism that is always levels against international student is that they/we are stealing American jobs. I completely disagree with that. In almost all graduate schools in engineering, as has been pointed in the text of the proposed rule, an overwhelming number of doctoral students are international. Hiring an international student is costly for a professor as it limits the type of funding they are pursue for the student. Given the chance professors would prefer hiring US nationals. But despite this advantage, an overwhelming majority of the STEM PhD are international, which points to the fact that there aren't a whole lot of US Nationals to fill the positions in STEM graduate. A consequent effects of this is that some of the most skilled workers, workers who understand the new frontiers of technology and can give American businesses the competitive advantage, are the international students from such STEM programs.

While it may be true that American workers are facing tough challenges from foreign workers, I think the WashTech lawsuit was direct to the wrong visa program. Students that benefit from the America's education system should be given every chance to contribute to America. This is definitely how other developed nations treat their international students.
