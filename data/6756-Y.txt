Anonymous Anonymous I strongly support the new proposed OPT extension rule.

1. As I have seen, there is no such competition between foreign students and Americans on STEM subjects. There will be no such thing that hiring cheap foreign labor over Americans. As a matter of fact, for a same job position, American students are always given first consideration due to their less complicated work authorization situation. However, only American students alone cannot meet the needs on STEM graduates.

2. If people are worrying about foreigners taking over their jobs, why offering them higher education opportunities at the first place? US universities spend tons of money on training those foreigners to become experts in STEM, and for what? Sending them back to their homeland instead of making contribution on US economy? That just doesn't add up to me. An OPT extension will help US to keep those talents to continue contributing to this country and even forever.

3. America is built by the hard working immigrants. This happened 300 years ago, it is happening now, and it will continue happening in the future. Immigrants, especially skilled immigrants have always been an important part of American history. And they should continue playing this role in any near future you can foresee.
