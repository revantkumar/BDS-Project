I shall list several reasons that extending OPT would benefit the economy and the society.

Most mentioned reason for this extension is that international student are "stealing" local people's jobs. And this is apparently not true. 
All students in STEM will and only eligible for applying for jobs related to their major, otherwise it won't get approved. The jobs most needed by local people are not those STEM related jobs, and, in fact, companies are struggling to find people with STEM backgrounds because STEM majors are not so popular with local students. Students with STEM majors are actually fullfilling the shortage in the STEM related job market. Most importantly, companies tend to hire local students because of the high cost for sponsoring International student. This is why it is NOT true at all that international students are stealing local people's jobs.

Also, it was said that 

The STEM international student are actually helping the economy and advance of the society. As we know that technology and science are the things drive the society forward. International STEM student is fulfilling the shortage in this job market, helping with the smooth advance in all science related industries. 

That is why I think extending the OPT is helping the society and the economy.
