Why don't US want more well-educated people to work here? I'm a PhD and work in the university, and my wife now has these kind of visa issues. I have to spend a lot of time and energy to try to solve them-----I should have done a better job and write more papers!

As far as I can see, if the US government would like to reject the international students, then there might be less and less great students would like to stay in the US(I will definitely be one of them), and I don't think without these students the university in US could still lead the world. Of course, this doesn't hurt in short term, however without these great university and innovative works they made I would say it is extremely hard for US to keep developing the hi-tech companies, which can definitely hurt the job market in the longer term.
