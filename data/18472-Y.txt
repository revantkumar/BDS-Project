I support this OPT extension policy to 24 months of STEM.

I am one of the STEM F-1 students requiring OPT and H1B to work after graduation. This extension provides us more chance to draw lots of H1B so we have more opportunities to work at US and contribute our efforts to the development of the society.

Even if I am not belonging to those STEM F-1 students, I still support this extension because it will help the development of the US and the further whole world. With the excellent work and achievements of the F-1 students, the US will keep its style of freedom and equity. Thus the science technology will accelerate the world towards the ideal one. It will also unite people from different countries and cultures together, helping for world peace.
