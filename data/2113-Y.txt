I strongly agree with with proposal that OPT should be extended for 24 month for STEM students. 

First, most STEM majors has working programs which lasts for at least 2 or 3 years after graduation, and the integrity of these programs would be greatly affected if a STEM student can not work for the entire process of the programs. For example, my major is Civil Engineering, Construction Management, after my graduation, almost all the jobs I can find would have construction projects that last at least 3 years for mid-size projects, and at least 2 years for small size projects. If there is no 24-month OPT extension, then that means I have to leave the project at the end of first year, which would really impact the process of the project as well as the learning process after my graduation. 

Second, for most high tech companies in US, such as Google and Facebook, they strongly rely on talent people from other countries. If the extension of OPT is not available, that means these high tech companies has to change a lot of employees every year, which would be a disaster because they usually need to provide training for new employees, and want these employees to work for years after the training, thus, the result of no OPT extension would be, the cost of projects would be much higher, and the process of development of new technologies would be much slower, which is definitely very bad for US's economy. 

Third, as I will go back to my home country after I learnt a lot of useful knowledge in US, a longer OPT period would make my learning more complete, which is also one of the most important reasons I considered when I choose to pursue my education in US. 

Thus, I strongly agree with the proposal that OPT should be extended for 24 month. 

Thanks
