I strongly agree with this proposal on STEM OPT program. I think it will be beneficial to US economy as a whole in a long term. Among those international students who graduate in STEM fields of study and with higher degree, many of them are elites in their countries. It will be a big loss if we let them leave US just after a short period of training (one year based on regular OPT program) after graduation. In reverse, by extending the STEM OPT program, those talented students can obtain enough training experience and make a big contribution to various high tech industries. The creativity, diversity and intelligence those international students can bring with will inspire the whole US economy growth.
