I strongly support the extension on Training Opportunities.
As we can see the US is and was the most powerful country for decades.The deep reason for this is high-quality immigration from all generations attracted and worked hard on all kinds of situation to build the society especially on technology. For years the US has been the dream land for the best students and scholars all over the world due to the open mind attitude.
The negative effect,which can be a signal for the attitude to technology students and scholars, on cancelling extension OPT can be far-reaching. How many loses will there be When the best students all over the world no longer believe this is the place they are welcomed?
During and after the OPT, talent employees will stay and contribute more to the US in the most highly competitive area of the world-technology. Those who can't will contribute the consuming and demand for American companies.
There's no competition between US citizen and international student.If there's no HUGE DIFFERENCE between the capacity for the job, american citizen will surely get the job.
In conclusion, the extension on Training Opportunities will benefit the US a lot without doing damage to the job market of American Citizens. I strongly agree with the proposal.
