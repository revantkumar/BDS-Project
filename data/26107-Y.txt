I strongly support this proposed rule for Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. Here are the top reasons why I would like to support this:

1. It is for the interest of many US employers and US government to keep talented F-1 STEM students here longer to make intellectual contributions to the country and keep its leadership in the world. The government has spent considerable amount of money and resources in cultivating these foreign talents and it would be a great disadvantage for US to just let them leave to contribute to their own countries as soon as they finish their studies in the states. STEM majors are the driving force for new technologies and a booming economy. These students are valuable resources, rather than a burden to the country.

2. If the US government are willing to keep illegal immigrants from the other side of the border to work in this country without valid documents. Why can't they keep legal non-immigrant STEM students here to work for the country just a little longer?

3. The Universities and Education industries would also benefit greatly from this rule as it would attract more talented students from around the world to come here to study in US. Their presence contributes to economy of the country as well.
