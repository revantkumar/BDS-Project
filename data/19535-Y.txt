I strongly support the new OPT extension rule.

As an international student now working in the financial industry, the new rule to keep all STEM students working in the American will highly benefit companies here. First, I'm enrolling the two-year program for 2 groups rotation. The longer length OPT time will give us opportunity to better finish the projects related to the program, and help us serve the companies better through deeply understanding the business. I believe there are millions of companies in the United States offering long period programs especially for research and development area. Secondly, the longer OPT will reduce the H1B application pressure on employer. They can be better prepared all the international application documents and at the same time save budgets. Last but not least, it will be a disaster if less international students supporting technology / mathematics / programming business. Base on a common knowledge, a lot of high-tech companies have STEM talents to help them dealing with coding and modeling problems. Can you imagine that one day these future business fallen because of lack of professionals from STEM field? 

I hope more people will support the new OPT extension rule, and we can work together to build a better and better America!
