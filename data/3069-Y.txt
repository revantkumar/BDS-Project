I strongly support the rule of extending OPT of F1 student status for another 24 months, as well as the rule of Cap-Gap relief allowing such students to automatically extend the duration of F-1 status. STEM extension means lower cost and more resources for the technology companies. Instead of suffering huge cost to recruit globally, the tech companies and research institutes can obtain highly skilled employees after the STEM students finish their study and training here in US, at much lower cost. These highly educated graduates will bring more tax, social security, and job opportunities that make America great again.
