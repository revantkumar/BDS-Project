I hope you stop the (illegal) expansion of the OPT program. There are many college graduates who are US citizens who care carrying school loans from our own colleges who need these computer jobs. Many of the foreign born students have little or no school debts,as many have obtained at least part of their education for free or small payments from their homelands. Coming here, they often get subsidies and grants. How can our own taxes be used to support people who are taking away our own citizens' jobs and opportunities? I saw this clearly in my own family in 2 generations.
Thank you.
