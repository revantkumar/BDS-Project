I strongly support the new OPT rule proposed by DHS for the following two main reasons. First, the United States is commended on and benefited greatly from its multiculturalism. The new rule will surely promote the cultural diversity of American society and attract more talented students from around the world to study in the U.S. Second, American Universities invest a lot of money and human resources on the education of international students. The new rule will allow excellent international students to practice what they learn in the U.S. and pay back to the American society by contributing their knowledge and skills to the growth of American economy.
