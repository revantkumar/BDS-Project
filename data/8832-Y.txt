I think government invests a lot on the higher degree education, such as scholarships for the undergraduate students, graduate students and PhD students. The government hopes that there would be profits after the investment. So after graduation, all these international students with higher education background can contribute their power in both industry and academics for united states, if they can work in the united states. That's why H1-B should be supported.
