This is a welcome move, i believe that OPT should be for 24 months extension. 

One thing we need to understand that F-1 is temporary Non immigrant visa, it will not take away any Americans job. F-1 students pay 3 times more fees for college what a resident pays. In Az in state tution fee is $12000 yearly but F-1 pays $32000. Its 250% more than American students pay in a year> In total of 4 years of Degrees course it pays somewhere around more than $100,000. if there will be no OPT or its not going to be extended then very few international students will come in this country. In addition to pay fees, F-1 students also contribute in economy by buying a car, renting an apartment or houses. If we do not get a chance to do OPT then why will i come to U.S.A for education, Canada and Australia will be better options.
