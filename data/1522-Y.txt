Shilan Dong International students need longer STEM time. This is not only good for international students, also, this is a better chance for Americans to learn about other countries. American is a wealth country, but it is not the only country in the world. Unwilling to extend the STEM is only making Americans less respectful to the world and more arrogent. This extension is a win-win thing.
