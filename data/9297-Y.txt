I strongly support the OPT extension. The main reason is that qualified jobs in the U.S. desperately need foreign students. As a matter of fact, the foreign students who decide to come to this country to study are the best from their countries, and they come here to benefit from the high level of education offered by the U.S. system. Once their studies are completed, only a small portion of them is able to find a job, because most job offers do not sponsor H1-b visa. The students who decide to stay, they do it because they see U.S. as a land of opportunity, where talent and hard working are greatly acknowledged. Big industries in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook or Apple welcome every year hundreds of talented young people, and their CEOs wish they could hire more. To this matter I can quote a paragraph in Steve Jobs's bibliography by Walter Isaacson in which during a dinner with president Obama back in 2011 he "stressed the need for more trained engineers and suggested that any foreign students who earned an engineering degree in the U.S. should be given a visa to stay in the country."
I see the OPT extension as a way to give talented foreign students the same opportunity as American citizens. I don't really see foreigners gaining an advantage in that, since, in the end, what matters is skill and preparation, and companies always strive for the best, no matter if this is found amongst citizens or foreigners.
