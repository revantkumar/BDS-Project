Strongly support the Rule. For one hand, this will free the H1B lottery from the heated situation. As an alternative option of the H1B lottery, the OPT and its extension can helps to release the country from the pressure of the immigration. Also, OPT and its extension can help more talented person to have an opportunity to contribute the this great country, both on the society building and on the economical improvement. Thirdly, the extension will be working for students with STEM degrees who are the main force of the high-tech industry. These student can not only help to accelerate the development of the high-tech industry but also can help providing high-quality service to the citizens of United States. Last, most of these students just want to use OPT and the extension to learn by working for one or two years. With the OPT and the extension, the United Stated can have these talented students' contribution without much increasing of immigrations. That's a win-win option. Can't see any drawbacks of this rule.
