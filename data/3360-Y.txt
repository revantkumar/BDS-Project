I strongly support this rule.

America is a country of immigrants. It's ridiculous to even thinking about stopping legal immigrants from getting a job. A lot of naive comments here said this place foreigners over Americans, which is terribly wrong. I'm telling you why:

1. People say this will place foreigners over Americans. Wrong! Indeed all this program intends to do is to provide an EQUAL opportunity for international students just as Americans have, it's not one over the other.

2. People say companies will hire cheap foreign labors. Wrong! Companies want to hire talented and skilled people for the job, nationality is not a matter. People working with OPT are just paid the same as domestic workers (come on, think about it, eventually they will apply for H1-B visa, which requires them to be paid above prevailing wage). They are also paying a fair amount of income taxes, and they are helping develop the US economy, bringing values to the America. It's a win-win for Americans and foreign people.

3. A lot of protesters here are saying foreigners are "stealing" jobs from them. That's simply ridiculous. People don't steal jobs from you. The rule is simple, people who are talented, hard-working, dedicated, get the job. Those protesters are just going to complain, they never find their own problems, they never learn, they are not willing to work hard.

Americans like to be treated equal. That being said, we should treat everybody equal, no matter where they came from. And this is a fair program, as it provides foreigners as well as Americans an equal opportunity.
