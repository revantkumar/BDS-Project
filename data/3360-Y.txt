Khagendra Siripurapu Respected Authorities,

Most of the comments here say this rule is going to take away american jobs. Their comments are based on conservative media rhetoric without numbers to prove it. If we keep that aside for discussion, Who is American ? isn't majority of these vocal Americans are 1st, 2nd or 3rd generations of immigrants?? 

It is not students who are taking away american jobs. It is Current H1-B system which is giving chance for industry to import cheap labor and put them on a "Green Card process ". This process is like treadmill you will be in same place in hope of getting green card even after a decade; for immigrants money is less concerned compared to fear of starting green card process if they change company. Companies know this situation & en-cash this by replacing american employees from jobs(since they expect more benefits/higher salary) . Immigrants would call this system is nothing but "modern day slavery" but for american who is not on this "immigration treadmill " might see this as "companies love to immigrants". If all immigrants also have visa flexibility on par with citizens why would any immigrant student/immigrant worker will work for less benefits.This is the same political system which fight for H1B increase instead of fixing the process of Green card. Because H1B helps companies to keep wages low by tieing worker to green card process. This kind of system is not helping immigrants and Americans. So instead of cheer leading for political rhetoric of "Students/Immigrants taking away American jobs" American should push their representatives for legal immigration reform as a long term solution.

I would conclude saying that Students who studied here got well assimilate to american culture & giving them a chance of chase their "American Dream" is a welcoming move. You never know next Billion dollar company could be from one of these students.
