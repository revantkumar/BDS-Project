I think this will do more good to both the international students and the US, because this will attract more international students to come to US for further education, and this will improve the economy since they brought more opportunity and money if you say into the United States, and also, if they can stay longer after their get their degree in US, they will contribute more to the nation since every nation needs more high intelligent people to built. And also, as a international student myself, I hope the United States would make it more easier for us to extend our visa, otherwise it will be painful to work here instead come back to my own country.
