As a STEM majored international student on F-1 visa, I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. The OPT extension was originally designed for students who received higher education in specific fields of science and technology to practice what they learned in various high tech industries which nowhere else in the world has a more advanced entire eco-system than the United States. The competitive advantage of this country has been and will always be built on technological innovations and progressions, depriving STEM students the opportunity to stay in the US for the long term and contribute to technological advancements is step back from making this country better and more competitive, and more importantly it sends an unwelcoming message to the international student community.

2. STEM majored international students do not pose a threat to U.S. citizens who also seek employment in similar fields because for decades there has been a severe shortage of STEM majored master/PhD students in the U.S. OPT extension was first implemented to solve this exact problem. In addition, over the years the number US college students who choose to study in STEM majors has been decreasing, so why all of a sudden the government needs to cut back on the supply of STEM majored students to the labor force. This simply makes no logical sense.

3. STEM majored students is only a PART of H1B applicants every year. They should not be singled out and targeted for a broader issue. STEM students contribute to the U.S higher education industry and they put in really hard work to seek opportunities to contribute to the greater society, they should be placed on a level playing field with all other qualified candidates. If regulations need to be designed and rolled out, it needs to be applied to ALL, not just STEM students.
