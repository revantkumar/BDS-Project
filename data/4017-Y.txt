Lynette Wiens We (hopefully including you) must start caring about our country and about our jobs that you are allowing to be stripped away from us. We don't understand why you are going back on your words you've promised us - you are not covering our backs, and it's legally just plain WRONG!!! Hope to God if you don't take a stand for us, your job will also be stripped away from you! Yes, one can only hope!
