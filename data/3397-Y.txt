I totally SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:
First, America was borne to be a great country that shoulder the responsibility to make achievements for human society. As the process of global economy is accelerating, some policies should be issued to keep great brains of various immigrants.
Second, job opportunities will not diminish. It should be admitted that there are some kinds of jobs which Americans are not intended to do or just not suitable for. So what is the reason to prevent them from working in these positions? It won't jeopardize previous job opportunities for native Americans. Plus, to some extent competition could help America foster numerous brilliant scientists and engineers. Actually, they are valuable human resource in the future.
