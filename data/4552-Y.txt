I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the US.
2. Diversity is very important not only to universities but also to the whole society.
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It actually man our mankind improving and growing.
