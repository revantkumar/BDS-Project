I just feel amused that some of us are mentioning about the cheap labor. Let's see what the policy is talking, "If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers, the employer would be required to ensure that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers in other employers of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area of employment." 

They pay the OPT student fairly simply because they deserve. They support and help the whole industry in progressing, as well for the whole US economy. I personally support this policy firmly.
