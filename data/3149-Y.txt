Guchuan Sun As a Chinese PhD student, I strongly support this policy, for several reasons.

1. It is good for the future of US. As we all know, international workers have made much contribution to US, especially in STEM fields, which is rapidly developing. Passing this proposal can encourage more students to stay in US and continue their research here.

2. It provides more convenience to international students. For us international students, longer OPT means more opportunity to get an H1B visa. International students, especially those with high education, will be glad to work in US. I am pretty sure most of the PhD student in STEM have all kinds of abilities.

3. It is also good to fight against illegal immigration. I do not think the OPT extension provides any chance to illegal immigration. On the contrary, it contributes to a more standard immigration policy. If US allows more STEM OPT students and at the same time limits international people in "grey zone", there will be more working people instead of some low-educated ones.
