I strongly support this policy!

Some people said Americans will lose job due to the extension of OPT of STEM F1 students, even some disabled people complained about that, which does not stand. Obviously companies all yield precedence to the disabled people. And because STEM students are all well paid and take technical jobs (which cannot be done the unemployment natives), we can see that STEM F1 students in fact help improve the economy.
