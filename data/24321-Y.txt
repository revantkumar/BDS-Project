I strongly support this new policy for the following reasons. 

1. A very important reason why the US can keep its world leading position in economy, science and technology is that the talents from all over the world contribute to a highly diverse and innovative working environment, especially in the high-tech industrial.

2. The expanding training oppotunities will attract more international students to study in the US, which brings more fundings to the US education system and stimulates the local economy in many college towns around the US.
