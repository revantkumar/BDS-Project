I strongly support the proposal for the following reason:

New graduates from U.S. institutions have the best potential of contributing to the development of American scientific and engineering industries. It would be beneficial for companies to progress in a faster speed and create more opportunities for American students and citizens in the long term. The training opportunity does not improve the chance for non-immigrant students to stay permanently so there is nothing to worry about in that sense. It would also boost the diversity in these fields such that more innovations can be inspired and better products can be produced and make their ways to American families.
