As to a lot people said international students are unqualified or uneducated to certain positions , however, if you read carefully through the proposal, DHS has said the OPT extension needs the official review and will not grant if they are not qualified.

Plus, public colleges and universities REALLY REALLY benefit from the tuition payment from international students when compared to the in-state or out state students.
