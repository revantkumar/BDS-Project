Fei Lu When I was not in the US, I have already known that what US is, or it was told to be. It is a peaceful, fair and hopeful land. And When I am here, I feel it still should be, for me, for you and for the whole society.

OPT extension of F-1 student is important for US society, one year OPT is too short for the company or the society to know if the student is really helpful for the company or the society. OPT extension for STEM F-1 student will not reduce the job for other Americans, they actually contributes and creates.

US society needs a lot of well-trained high tech workers which requires years of education and lab works. STEM students are the main source of those workers and which is not conflict with other jobs for local Americans.

Plus, to maintain US the most competitive country of the world, US needs fresh blood, mainly STEM students, in the research area. These jobs are generally tough and not everyone willing to do. To realize American Dream, STEM students will accept such jobs.

Last but not the least, STEM students are well educated, therefore, it will not cause any social problems. They only can make the society safer, more colorful and fruitful.

Please, let the students stay to make the community better, the country better and the society better. Given everyone the opportunity, that is the spirit of US, for Gods sake and the founders of United States sake.
