David Jones Let's see the statistics from the survey of graduate students and postdoctorate, conducted by National Science Foundation. (Attachment Enclosed)

By 2010, international students account for 70 percent of the full-time graduate students (masters and Ph.D.s) in electrical engineering, 63 percent in computer science, 60 percent in industrial engineering, and more than 50 percent in economics, chemical engineering, materials engineering and mechanical engineering. These students represent a vital source of talented professionals, researchers and innovators for U.S. employers.

STEM OPT provides the opportunity for the students to contribute their knowledge to our nation. If cancelled, the US will lose 50%-70% intelligent power. Why do we cancel it? Additionally, our proud college/university education will be meaningless if 50%-70% graduates cannot find jobs here.

Please keep the STEM OPT extension and make the competitive environment open to all the motivated students.
