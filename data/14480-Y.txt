I strongly support the proposal because of following reasons: 

First, diversity is the foundation of the contemporary culture and economy of the United States. People from different country with various backgrounds keep coming to U.S., bring their intelligence and contribute their own effort to the US society. With this proposal, U.S. can attract more international students to pursue a STEM degree here and make contribution to the U.S. industry and economy. 

Second, U.S. should give the students graduated from STEM majors a chance to implement what they have learnt in the U.S. universities, rather than just let them learn the most high-end knowledges and watch them going back home. And the importance of expanding training opportunities is that most new employees start to make contribution to their companies from the second year of working, as it is a few months to a year for a new college graduates to get familiar with the working environment and the knowledges specific to the positions. 

Third, the reason why there are more and more international students filing the positions of STEM companies is that the STEM, especially the high tech companies are expanding dramatically these days. U.S. citizens alone cannot fill the gap between the large amount of employees the high tech companies need and the limited number of candidates holding U.S. citizenship. Just take a look at the percentage of international students takes in the current number of employees in some high tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook, you can understand how important the international students are. If we cannot have these international graduates to stay and work in U.S with expanded training opportunities, there is no doubt that it will have a big impact on the high tech companies as well as the U.S. economy.

To sum up, I hold the opinion that the proposal is of great importance to the U.S. and I look forward to seeing that it can come into effective soon in the future.
