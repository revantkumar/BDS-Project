I definitely support this rule. STEM internationals are helping US in many ways, especially in the development of modern technology. There is a large shortage of STEM workforce in US to satisfy the need, and the gap will increase as time flies. 

If US still wants to keep its leadership in the world, technology advance is absolutely the number one thing to care about. In order to keep this advance, it is best to keep all STEM internationals bring fresh blood to the industry, particularly those who want to stay in US and may even want to be the immigrants. And the advantage of this will also benefit Americans in many ways, such as creating new companies with plenty new jobs and keeping all the cutting edge technologies stay in US.
