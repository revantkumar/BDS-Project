SHIQI WANG I strongly support the STEM OPT extension. 
First, OPT extension is not a negligible factor that attracts large amounts of international students to study in the United States; without OPT extension, many students will probably not come to the US for higher education, as a result, US Education Industry will be affected badly. 
Second, international students take a large proportion in STEM fields. If STEM extension is overruled, many talented students in these industries have to leave and there will be heavy losses in STEM industries, thus directly influencing the US economic and technological prosperity.
Third, United States is such a nation that advocates egalitarian and freedom. I believe that excellent scientists and engineers are borderless; those talented people from all over the world come to the US to acquire more advanced technologies and professional knowledge, and actually they will greatly contribute not only to the nation, but the whole world. 
Above all, I think STEM OPT extension is not only a benefit for international students, but will play a critical role in U.S. competitiveness and the national interest.
