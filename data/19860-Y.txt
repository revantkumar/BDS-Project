I noticed that the supporters of the F-1/OPT programs appear to have mainly foreign surnames and vice versa. My husband is an engineer and has seen the dramatic change that has occurred over the years from replacing American engineers with foreign workers. His business complex which includes other companies, primarily GE, he describes as looking like a third-world country and English is barely heard. 

Early education in the U.S. is suffering and American students have serious doubts about getting a job in occupations that require a STEM education. This is due to the preferred employment by US companies of low-wage employees brought into the US for these programs. It is a tragedy on two fronts. It dumbs down the American student population; and the well-educated foreign students who could make significant contributions to their home countries are greedily kept in the US to increase corporate profits. 

"It is nice that America allows foreign students access to American institutions of higher learning, as those individuals can return to their home countries and help them to improve the standards of living for their citizens. However, until every STEM-trained American citizen is gainfully employed in one of those professions, we should not have non-citizens taking those jobs, and we definitely do not need an expansion of the current indefensible program." (Echoing the thoughts of Mr. Cooper.)
