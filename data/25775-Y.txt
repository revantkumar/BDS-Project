I strongly support the OPT extension.

Firstly, international students contribute a lot to the growth of US economy. These students are high-quality work force that cannot be ignored. Their knowledge is a great support to the development of USA. Without policies like OPT-extension, USA will lose its vitality because it can no longer attracting the most talented students all around the world. American dream will hardly become true. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension..

Secondly, America is a country of immigrants. The request to place the right of citizens over non-citizens is simply RIDICULOUS. Just remember, every citizen or their ancester once was an immigrant.

Thirdly, USA probably has a lot of STEM people, but it simply does not have enough STEM talents.USA needs the talents from foreign workers to keep its machiens running well, and running better than the rest of the world.
