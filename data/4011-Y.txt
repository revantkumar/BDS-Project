This is awesome. You guys have no idea how difficult for international students to find a job in US because of visa status issue. For those who are lucky enough to find one, they have to struggle to find legal status after their F1. This act is a temporary solution for the ridiculously low chance of H1b selection process. Those are people who truly wanna stay in the country and make contributions. Go easy on them.
