I STRONGLY SUPPORT this rule. When I read some of the comments from US citizens talking about how this rule will take their jobs, the company will pay less, etc. It is NOT TURE!!! First of all, if companies did pay less to hire F-1 student and if you have evidence, you can report it to USCIS or DHS, and they will lose their e-verify and no longer able to hire foreigners. Secondly, from my personal experience, the reason why companies, such as Google and Facebook, want to hire STEM students is that they are way better well-trained than citizens. The companies have to pay extra fees to apply for H1b visa and it is not guaranteed. They may fail in the lottery and companies have to let them go, which will directly harm their profit because you have to find another well-trained guy to fill in that position. So a longer extension will provide more stable workers for high-tech companies and which are the hope of US economy.
