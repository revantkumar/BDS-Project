It's really a shame to see the descendants of immigrants oppose to this claims just because they are less competetive than the new graduates. They don't even think how their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents came into this country.

If you have stronger skills, you shouldn't worry about someone stealing your job. No, they just find a employer who needs them, with tons of adverse factors than citizens.

Anyway, I thinks this comment system is totally unfair. Because the population who are beneficial from this policy aren't familiar with American rules, and they have weaker expression skills.
