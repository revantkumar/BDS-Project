Xing Wei Hundreds and thousands of students have to go back home immediately after their OPT ends. I am sure companies will suffer from losing intelligent and hardworking workers. It will cost them a lot to recruit new workers. For students who hold the OPT and work for the US companies, they have at least bachelor's degrees. They play an important role in every field, including the economy, technology, engineering and etc. If they are not allowed to extend their OPT, they won't have much chances to help the country using what they learn from this country. It's a sad story.
