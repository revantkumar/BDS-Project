I strongly agree the proposal. It is a great idea for USA to become really international. Diversity is needed in this country and diversity is also how this country was built . Each company and organization would benefit from people from different background, nationality, and race. Great ideas are generated through mixing different thoughts instead of a single one. International students will benefit from the 24 month OPT by applying the knowledge to real world, which contribute to the growing of US. The company and employees would benefit more from these young people who can speak more than one languages and work really hard for their company.
