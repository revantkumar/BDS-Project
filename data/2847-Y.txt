Improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students is a double-win strategy for both US and international student majoring in STEM.

The reason why US leads the technology is because it has the best environment for foresting top engineer and scientist. It has very open policy for absorbing excellent engineers and scientists from all over the word. Expanding STEM will help US retain the excellent human resource in technology and science and maintain its leadership in science and technology.

I believe expanding OPT for STEM will not affect the employment of US Citizen. High-tech companies in US need enormous amount of employee in technology. The number of U.S citizens who have advanced degree in these fields is too small to satisfy the needs of those high-tech companies. It is very clear that international students are serving as complement for those US companies rather than competing with US citizens for a job.
