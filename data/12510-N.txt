This ruling will place American students to great disadvantage. There are not enough jobs for foreign workers and for our own people. Over 40% of Americans with STEM degrees are unable to find jobs that utilize their training and education. Companies make up phony requirements to obtain the foreign workers. I am requesting from you a study on the number of Americans displaced due to the entry of foreign workers -- e.g. those at Disney.
