International students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to NAFSAs latest economic analysis. And what makes study in America so different compared to European countries is the OPT program that allow students to gain more work experience. And if OPT extension is canceled, I think most Chinese students like me will consider Europe or Canada instead of America when they pick the school. International students are here to bring more money and talented people, not get Americans' job. Besides, America is a free country and it's a country made by European immigrants, African immigrants, Asian immigrants and other countries' immigrants. And people like me, we have a Bachelor or Master or PhD degree, we proved ourselves more talented. With us being part of this country (let alone we are not even immigrants), while we are getting more experience in the OPT program, we contributes more to the companies, to this country.
