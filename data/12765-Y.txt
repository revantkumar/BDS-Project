I actively SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule.

As my personal experience working in high-tech company, most large projects last at least 2 year or more. 12 month regular + 24 month extension for STEM OPT is reasonable and perfect matches the term request for a project.

If someone working with his OPT has to quit the project because of the issue of his VISA, it will be disaster of the whole project and company. Since to take over others work in computer science industrial, for example, you have to spend a lot of time to read and understand others code and logistic. It has strong impact on the progress of the project.

As we known, not only high-tech industrial project; but also education research project requests long-term duration. And for many companies, the demand for STEM major student is huge. The new OPT rule can be the best and strongest backup of the projects that have STEM OPT student involved in.
