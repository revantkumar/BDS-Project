It's real helpful rule. But in the mean time before rule is implemented there are many students on F1 STEM OPT between 10/19/2015 and the rule to be implemented date. Can yo please add something to the rule to help students who are in this situation?

Otherwise student should leave USA, because there STEM OPT is going to end just before rule in implemented and they cannot use it. There are many whose 12 +17 months STEM OPT ending in November , December of 2015 and January of 2016 and they see the rule but cannot use it as it is not implemented yet.

I would also recommend to have rule changed so that more smooth transition in career is done for F1 students as H1b visa are very limited. We have good jobs that are very helpful for economic growth but cannot stay and contribute just because we don't have work authorization. Doing Master's degree and working for awhile we really get integrated to the society and love to have our family and children grow here. Please do consider human aspect and impact of the rule too.
