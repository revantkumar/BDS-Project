I Firmly support this decision. As an international employee myself, I can see this is a win-win situation for U.S. companies (esp.high-tech ones) and for highly intelligent and hard-working international candidates. With lots of advanced degree candidates joining the industry, companies can embrace healthy competition and cultural diversity that contribute to move the entire U.S. economy to another high level.
