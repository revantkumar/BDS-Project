Anonymous I Strongly support this amendment and greatly appreciate DHS for proposing this.

Its good for the students who have chosen US universities to get their Master degree, to achieve more exposure in US companies. US companies are known for having the most diverse resource pool which gives a unique opportunity for these students to work with top talents. With global universities competing to upgrade their status, these measures will provide a continued advantage to US Universities which have been a magnet for top students from all around the world.
