I support this rule and strongly hope it is passed. Extending the OPT for international students is not only good for the American employers, but also beneficial for American local workers. Because it will improve the general economy, which will in return boost the companies and increase the overall income. When the whole economy of a country is improved, the life of local people will also be improved. Local people gain benefits from this, too.
