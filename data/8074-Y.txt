I am a Chinese student who planning to study aboard after graduation. I hope the total OPT can be extended to three years. Currently, United States is my top choice due to its OPT plan. However, if the OPT shrinks to merely one year. I cannot see the advantage of American high education comparing to Singapore, which is also one of my choices. My major is Civil Engineering and with minor of mathematics. I plan to do some engineering related works after graduate study because top-notched engineers always learn their skills from experiences instead of schools. I admire America's achievements in many engineering field, but if there is no enough time for me to learn skills from employment, I think the value of American education will be significantly weaken.
