American jobs aren't being "given away". Americans do not pursue STEM careers nearly as much as people in other countries, and they absolutely do not pursue graduate level degrees in STEM. Quite frankly, Americans do not seem interested in taking these jobs. 
As for American graduates competing with foreigner who will accept lower wages, foreign students will often have a master's degree or higher and will therefore be more qualified for the position. In addition, foreign students must stay with the same company during the OPT period, and are therefore immobile. They will accept lower wages because that's what's offered to them in the STEM market. Is that their fault or the fault of unethical American companies?
