Micheal Yu Please approve this regulation. As a country founded by immigrants, U.S. attracts international elites to build herself. Without this OPT extension, more and more STEM graduates are leaving this country due to immigration issues. This will hurt the U.S. economy and international competitiveness. This regulation's contribution to US economy will create thousands of jobs, which provides more job opportunities for citizens instead of reducing them. To maintain the American status as an economic superpower and keep its promise of American dreams to generations of immigrants, we have to approve this regulation!
