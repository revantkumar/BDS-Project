Yu An I am strongly supportive of this proposal that providing 24 months extension of OPT for STEM F-1 students for following reasons:

1. As an international student, being able to practice the knowledge that we have learnt into particular work after graduation through OPT is one of the most important reasons why I come to United States. That is the reason why most of my friends accept the offers from universities in United States, not from UK or other countries, because we all know how important it is for us, especially for STEM students. 

2. With the increasing of international students, the economic of surrounding area of campus has been improving fast. Local residents are making more money by running any kinds of supporting business, such as restaurants and properties. For local natives, more job opportunities are created by the expansion of these companies in order to reach the need. I can clearly observe the progress of becoming more economical prosperity around our campus.

3. I have to say competition exists,but it is not a bad thing. Even if STEM students have OPT extension, there are too many disadvantages on international students compared to natives. To achieve the same career goal as native residents, international students need to pay more efforts and language will be the first barrier. Therefore, to those who claim "Let's keep these jobs for hard working Americans, not foreigners!", I just want to say you are not hard working enough.
