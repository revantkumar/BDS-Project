I am a CTO of a small tech startup in Bay Area and our company has ~10 international students who are using OPT to work. Based on my hiring experience, it is EXTREMELY hard to find qualified engineers in US job market without considering OPT student. Please, do expand the OPT or increase the quota of H1B.
