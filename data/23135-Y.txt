I am a STEM majored graduate who is working in an IT company now. As many other STEM majored graduates, I wish to contribute my knowledge to the scientific and tech-related areas in the United States. When I heard the news that I lost my H1B petition and the opt-extension was revoked, I start to worry my eligible status in the US. This definitely has bad effects on my daily job.

As we know, the competition in the scientific and tech-related job market is more and more intense these years. If there is no opt-extension for STEM students, most of excellent graduates will be forced to leave, which is a great loss to the US. 

I strongly agree to give a longer time period for these great graduates to get their eligible status to work in the US.
