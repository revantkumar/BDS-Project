I support this extension of the STEM F-1 students. 

The main reason is, United Status is a country built by immigrants, and one of the most important reason that US is the strongest country in the world, is because it is attracting and welcoming people with talent and professional skills from all over the world. 

Here, we are not even talking about luring experts from other country, we are talking about thousands of young men and women who ALREADY TOOK U.S. ADVANCED EDUCATION for several years! So we spend the world's greatest teaching & training resources to educate them, and then kicking them back to their home countries because we "worry about they may take our job"? This is completely joke! Young labor, especially well educated young labor is the most valuable resource in the world, and every country is fighting hard for them, like China just repeal their single child policy in order to boost their young population.

If you just want your job security, go live in some island country where there are less than 100 population, so that no one can take your job! 

Btw, here I also disclaim that personally I am not under F-1 Nonimmigrant status thus I won't take any benefit from this.
