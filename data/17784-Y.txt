I strongly support this proposed rule for the following reasons: First of all, It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US for better education and go through all the cultural and language challenges deserves more time to practice their skills and expand their experiences in industries after graduation. Secondly, it's good for US economy to have talented foreign people to work in IT area, since not a lot US citizens are willing to study in area such like engineering. Last,it's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
