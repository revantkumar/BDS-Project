Parashar Thanki I strongly support this proposal by the DHS to amend its F-1 non-immigrant visa regulations on Optional Practical Training for students with degrees in STEM from US institutions.

The contribution of these approximately 1 million international students to the US economy is very substantial. Starting from immigration fees all the way to tuition fees. According to the US Department of Commerce, international students contributed more than $30.5 billion to the US economy - not to mention the various industries they supported in employment. If the STEM extension would be revoked, it would definitely be a major turn off to a lot of international students who come to the US for higher students. Most of these students take out loans in their home countries, and they look to employment in the US to help them get back on their feet. If the STEM extension is invalidated, this will definitely decrease the inflow of students to the country.

This will adversely affect the US economy in many ways - all the way from tuition fees to the lack of top level talent at the industrial level.
