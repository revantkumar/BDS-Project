I absolutely support the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. This is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who are studying at Universities, who are working at companies and who are planning to study abroad in America.

1) International students are playing more and more important roles in US. They make contribution of government revenue, create values for their companies and make US. a better place.

2) I believe every international students or aliens have a American Dream. They are eager to work at America to have a better lives. They are eager to be viewed equally, to have the basic right of work. However, right now they also need to worry about someday their working right will be deprived. And this proposal of 24 month-extension is absolutely a hope for them.

3) OPT extension only benefits not all the international students, but these who attained STEM degree, and limit them to work in their industry. Therefore, there is no necessary to worry about it.
