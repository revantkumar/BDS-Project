I strongly SUPPORT the OPT-extension for the following reasons: 

1. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed. Stop hiring international students will not help those who do not study hard and have no talents in certain fields. It will only cause an economic decline in general and slowdown the technology development of America because a huge amount of vacancies would be left to people who do not qualify them.

2. If intelligent International students with STEM degrees were allow to work more 16 more months, they would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as the technology development. 16 months more employment benefits both the employers and the employees hugely. International students got the best education from American colleges. It is their duty to contribute to the American economics as return.

3. After calculation, it turns out that out of all potential international employees, only 19% of them could stay and get a working VISA from the lottery. Most of them will eventually go to their home country and work there, leaving a lot of vacancies for newly graduated students.
