As a UK student,I strongly support this new OPT extension rule and to be honest, it's my reason to be USA to continue my study. I'm a electrical engineering student in England. Actually, I have already got my offer from Imperial College and University of Collage London.The most important reason that I give up studying in UK and choose to study in US is I really want to get the experience of US life and work.As you know, electrical engineering in US is somewhat better than UK and therefore I believe its necessary to go to US and bring something new back to UK. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to still study in UK. What a lose-lose situation!!!
People always say that US is more open than UK, but if this rule is terminated by some reasons, I think US is just like UK and it will follow the old routine and finally lose in the future.
