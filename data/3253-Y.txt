Catherine Markitell Many of our college graduates are out of work. There are record numbers of "adult" children living with their parents. Baby boomers not only have to take care of their elderly parents but now their children. Give the young people a break. STOP TAKING THEIR JOBS AWAY FROM THEM. We can't get visas in THEIR countries to work because THEIR country protects THEIR rights!!
