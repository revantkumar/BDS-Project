I strongly support this new OPT policy.
A lot of foreign students are studying at United State now and there will be more and more students in the future. OPT extension helps a lot of F1 students get the opportunities to contribute to the development of society since most of majorities in STEM are related to high technology and science. A lot of citizens complaint that the new OPT policy will reduce the opportunities for the American people to find jobs. However, I don't find any relationship between them. Since the science and technology are developing faster and faster in the 21st century, there are more and more high tech positions in a large number of high tech companies. For example, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn are recruiting more and more employees in these years. I don't think it will reduce the chance for American citizens to get jobs after the new OPT policy are rule because the shortage of high tech positions in these field. 
In contrast, if the US government just opens the door for the high tech talents, it will lose the leading positions in the world since China and Indian becomes stronger and stronger. I think a lot of American citizens simply regard OPT extension as the illegal immigration case. Actually, the big difference is that illegal immigrants will do harm to right of US citizens because they are hired as a lower cost. Its result in the lower opportunities of employment for American people if most of the employment positions are filled in the traditional industries ( food, travel and traffic ). However, positions for the high tech fields are never field since it develops more and more faster. If the OPT extension is abolished, a large number of talent foreign students lose the opportunity to contribute to United State society and will back to their Countries ( China, India and Korea). It is such a pity for the United State. Therefore, I strongly support this new OPT policy.
