I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The development of the U.S cannot leave without the international students, especially in the area of STEM. With the expanding of OPT for F-1 Students, these students will bring more improvements in technology to the U.S.
2. Improving and expanding OPT for F-1 Students will absolutely attract more international students coming to the U.S, which will in return bring more benefits.
3. The U.S is a country of immigrants. Diversity is the tradition and one of the most important characteristics of the U.S, which also makes the U.S the most powerful country in the world.
4. Competition does exist but in my opinion it will improve the competitions of both native students and international students rather than take the opportunities away from native students.
