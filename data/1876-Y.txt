I strongly support the new rule. 

I don't even understand why we think this will be a threaten thing for United Sates citizens. 

It is actually a good thing for us to keep all these talented people. The other reason why we need to keep them is not only want to keep their talent, but also everyone will see the benefit from it. 

We will understand more about their culture, we will have more opportunity to have business with different country. We will also earn a lot from the competition with them. 

Look at Europe, and then look at us. We shouldn't just close our door to shut those people from our country just because we afraid of competition. We will learn and benefit from it too. 

Again, I believe it is a good thing for the whole United States.
