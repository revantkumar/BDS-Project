I'm for this proposal.

For this proposal only, I believe that more international students with a undergrad, graduate, or doctor degree would choose to stay in states for the purpose of bring united states to a higher stage -- make it a better country. Also, I think it's reasonable for all the students to have access to OPT extension. STEM is not the only talent that international students can provide. Now, one step at a time.

Students will be less stressful when applying or simply waiting for the approval of H1B, that a happier human being is created by this proposal. How simple is that? 

Corporations would benefit from this proposal as well. Normally 12 months would not be enough for individual to find a job and get trained and evaluated from the company. With the extension of OPT, companies will definitely spend more time on training, evaluating, guiding the employee. This proposal will bring more value to the company and cumulatively bring positive impact on the economics of united states. How wonderful is that?

If someone is against this proposal based on the reason that these students are stealing jobs from them. I believe a mature and reasonable employer would hire his or her employees solely based on whether this person is the perfect fit for the company.

Sincerely,
Shaohua
