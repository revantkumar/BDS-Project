Brad Peter I don't think there is a competition in getting jobs between the Americans and the foreign students. The foreign students who are in STEM programs mostly seek jobs in tech companies. For a fresh graduate with an F-1 status, he/she is only able to get jobs in non-classified commercial companies, which always prefer someone with a green card or citizenship. That said, the F-1 students who get the job are really good fit to these positions. Why don't we want people who have THE ability and/or even better others to stay and work for us?

In addition, Americans can easily get jobs in government departments, most of which don't accept foreigners without at least citizenship. The number of American graduates are far from filling up the positions that require graduates from STEM with advanced degrees, and US need the positions to be filled so companies can operate--less people will lose jobs, for Americans! 

That is why we should support the extension proposal. It provides an equal opportunity to all the people who are good are what they do, and it helps the American economy to be more diversified and robust.
