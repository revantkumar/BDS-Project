Fan Chen F1 Stem students should have the right to work in U.S for two more years, because first we will definitely bring benefits for American economy in many ways like working for big companies and make some break througn in some area. Then we live here, we consume every day, we make America more racial diversity.
Since, I strongly recommed the government can extend the OPT for us!
