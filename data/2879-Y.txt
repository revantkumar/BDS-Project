I do support the extension of the OPT for F1 students.
I'm a native American and I was really shocked by the negative comments under this rule... I worked in IT industry for nearly 12 years, and have met a lot of foreign students mainly from China and India. I know one thing about these people: they are intelligent, diligent and kind! 
I reviewed many comments arguing that these students robed job opportunities from citizens and I think this is ridiculous. If two candidates have the same interview review while applying the same position, the citizen candidate would have a much bigger chance of getting hired than foreign student, because the citizen doesn't need to apply for working visa and thus the company don't have to cover the application expense for him. So while you guys yelling about competitive foreign students 'robbing' working opportunities from you, why don't you take that time and learn some real skills?? 
There is no doubt that many of the foreign students have very impressive skills, so why don't hire them to help us develop USA to be a better country? Imagine if these intelligent people not getting hired and they turned to other countries, as time goes by, I believe that American IT companies cannot survive in the world-wide competition because many of the best people are working for countries like India and China. 
Overall, I can't see any reason to reject these intelligent people out of USA.
