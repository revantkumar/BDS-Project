I strongly support the proposal to expand the OPT for F-1 students with STEM degrees.
Reasons: 
1. US high-tech industry needs these STEM F-1 graduated students of high-tech background/education.
2. Even if they are not in US, there are not enough US students who study the STEM related majors in the universities. The F-1 students will not actually take the jobs from the US students.
