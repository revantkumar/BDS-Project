I am strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reason:

1. This proposal will bring a huge positive impact to the American economy and create more employment opportunities for American citizens. This proposal allows international STEM students to have longer training period after graduation and make more contribution to difference industries. While they are helping to improve American industries development, they also spend large amount of money for living expense, traveling and education. All of these will improve American economy in a incredible fast and health way, and create more and more employment opportunities for Americans. 

To make the cake bigger first so that everyone involved can have a bigger piece, or stop others' help at the right beginning because of worrying their will steal our pieces--Which will be the better and smarter way?

Thus, I SUPPORT this proposal and am very sure this will bring a huge positive impact to the U.S..
