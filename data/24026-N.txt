The Department of Homeland Security proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare.The preposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in The United States from one year to three years. It artifically expands the pool of avilable workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers !! Please put American workers first as should be the case.
