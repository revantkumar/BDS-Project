Ernest Thurston I am opposed to this program because it takes jobs away from US Citizens in favor of non-citizens. It also gives training and education to foreigners at the expense of our own students.
Why should we be giving well paying jobs and training to someone from another country when we have college students that can't find a job. 
Why should we be giving jobs to someone who will be using our social programs without putting anything back into our programs and economy. 
Why should we have a government program that provides training that will be used in another country and provide income that will most likely be sent back to a country other than ours. 
Why do we need another regulation on top of the current ones already approved by Congress. 
Immigration laws are supposed to support the integrity and security of our national borders. This does neither. 
I believe that when Congress makes a law it should be followed and agencies should not be able to get around them by making "rules" that have the effect of a new and different law that Congress never intended.
