Joey Lee It's shortsighted and unjust and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' right to work in US after graduation.I believe that allowing international outdents to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out.

Immigrant-founded Outrun 500 companies employed 3.6 million workers within us and responsible for more than $1.7 trillion i revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership for a new american economy.

It is in the interest of American people to let more talented international students to work here in order to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, H1B holders pay more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the state, those money is used to increase the medical and other American's life.

Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. For example, the minimum hourly pay standard for H1b holder is $24.16 in Albany, NY, and NY state has a minimum wage limit of $9.00. This is not even near! In fact, an international student needs about 3 times the salary of the minimum pay to stay in the US, and the payment is usually far higher than this because they usually work on comparatively rewarding positions like software engineer/developer.

American people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors and harm US interest.
