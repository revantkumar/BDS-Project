The United States need high-tech engineers and researchers to help its leading position in the world. The OPT extension program is good both for the STEM students and the employers. For the STEM students, they can have a longer time for the training and gain more experience. For the employers, especially for those high-tech companies, they can hire STEM graduates for a longer time so that they can make solid contributions to the companies. I see no reason to cut this OPT Extension program. It is a Win-Win option.
