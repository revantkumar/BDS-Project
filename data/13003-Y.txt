I strongly support the OPT extension.

Right on the contrary of many anti-OPT-extension opinions, OPT holders are NOT cheap labors, and they are not stealing away jobs from Americans by getting lower wages. Since OPT extension requires the job to be directly related to the person's degree, the OPT extension holders CANNOT do whatever jobs they want to do. They do not have choice over what job they can get. They are totally passive in the job hunting. If a company would like to hire an OPT holder, his wage by law CANNOT be lower than the wage of citizens. In other words, the US citizens are more competitive than those OPT holders.
