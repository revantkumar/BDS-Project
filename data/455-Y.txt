I support the rule. We are talking about STEM graduates trained in US universities here. We SHOULD give them opportunities to advance their careers and contribute to the economy. This would provide an additional chance for their H1B application if they wish to stay further in US. In an H1B application, the company(which is e-verified) has to provide details about the compensation given to the candidate to the DOL. Hence,the argument that these graduates are hired just to lower the wage rates is questionable. These people come in to the US *legally* following all the rules and regulations set forth by the DHS and USCIS. The United States has always been a land of immigrants and getting the hardworking and talented students from all over the world will create a better scenario of growth and future entrepreneurship which will create opportunities for everyone, INCLUDING the US citizens.
