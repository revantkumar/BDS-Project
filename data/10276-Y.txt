OPT STEM extension is a extremely important for all international students here in US. It provides the opportunities for internationals to work and apply for H1B Visa. Sadly there is a H1B Cap and thousands of people's future is controlled by the lottery and we cannot do anything about it. Extending the STEM Extension will provide every international 1 more opportunity in the lottery, which is extremely important. Extending OPT is not only beneficial to individuals, but also beneficial for companies, industries and this country. It is sad to see more and more capable, talented internationals have to leave their job, and this country because of the H1B Cap. Companies across the country are also struggling for hiring replacements for these talented internationals. Please, not only extended the STEM OPT Extension, but also increase the H1B Cap, so more and more hired young people can devote themselves for this country.
