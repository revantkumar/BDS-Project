I have been read this policy from US government carefully. I strongly support this proposal because It's a intelligent and wise choice and it can make a huge contribution to the students who study abroad. OPT extension will provide the graduate students more time to looking for a propriate occupation that they get by even get ahead. We known practical training is a significant preparation for us to start a career. Following this benificial proposal, the graduate student could accumulate much more experiences if they receive longer practical training time. As for me, my major is electronic engineering. If i study in US. I would take advantage of this preciuos opportunity to gain more relavant knowledge. I will become more competitive after entering compony. 

So. I hope US government could agree this policy. Everyone can benefit from it
