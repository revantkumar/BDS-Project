I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:
1. The U.S. should let international students have more chances to stay in the country, especially STEM students, to stay longer in the country after graduation, so that they can boost the technology and economics of the country. Foreigners are a large component of high tech systems. They create more job opportunities and more products, make development to the economics and technology, which benefit the Americans as well. Besides, they contribute more than 30% of their salary to the federal, which is used to increase the medical care and public services. 
2. The purpose of OPT is to have more exercise in the related area after the international students. Many scientific or technical projects require more than one year. How could a student have enough training in the working area in less than one year? If those students are forced to return to their countries before they have some achievement, what a severe loss for the science and technology! What we need is more people who are involved in high tech areas, and absolutely, the amount of the local scientists/engineers can't satisfy the needs from the country.
