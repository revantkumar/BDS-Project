Hongbo Wang I am a Chinese student who graduated from Florida International University last year with master degree in Engineering Management. I am currently working in the Air Conditioner company as an Application Engineer. I love my company located in Doral,Miami because I have got a lot of knowledge and experience from my job. My company will sponsor me H1B visa next year due to my excellent performance in the past several months. I really support the new STEM proposed rule because it will help me to get more working experiences and improve my ability. Also,I will continue to work for my company in order to become a better enterprise. I think all the foreign students with advanced degree who graduate from American universities will make a great contribution to the development of USA economy. They work so hard to find a job and utilize the knowledge to make profits for the US companies. They don't deserve to be deported from this country.These people are great assets for US so that they should have a longer period to stay in USA. So I hope the proposed rule could pass smoothly. Thanks for the proposal from DHS.
