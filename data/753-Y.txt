I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the OPT extension.It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens.

Are we the one who robbed all the jobs from Americans? No, we even create new positions for US citizens. It is true that most stem students choose to work for tech companies, but a considerate number of stem students has invested in various fields, such as real estates and catering. For these students, they need the extension only to take care of their business, and this has becoming a trend. They are self-funded and therefore will not put downward pressure neither on the wage nor the job market. They even create long-term jobs for US citizens since most of the employees they hired are US citizens, some of which have been offered a management position. To simply shut down the OPT extension is reckless and unreasonable, and would surely undermine the economy of the US.
