I strongly oppose the proposal. Extending STEM OPT will be of no help without increasing H1B visa cap because a lot of STEM OPT holders will still be forced to leave after 3 years of OPT. Then by the time they have to leave, it will create a even greater costs for companies because they are experienced employees with a lot of company-specific knowledge. Extending STEM OPT will also create an even larger pressure in the H1B lottery process because a lot of people whose OPT would have expired now get extended and they will remain in the pool for H1B lottery. Year over year, the chance of getting an H1B will be slighter and slighter, and employees may become reluctant to employ STEM students to avoid the risk of losing an experienced employee three years later. Extending STEM OPT is also unfair to non-STEM degree holders who fight equally as hard, or even harder, to stay in the U.S. if the United States cannot be fair to everyone and provide equal chance to everyone, how can it entitle itself as a country of freedom? A lot of non-STEM students are equally valuable as STEM students, and they are forced to leave the country without even getting a sense of what American Dream is all about. So if STEM OPT were to get extended, the same, or similar extension should be provided to non-STEM students, or the H1B cap should be raised.
