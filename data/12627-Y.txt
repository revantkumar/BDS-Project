I would definitely Support this new 24 month extension. I majored in Nutritional science in college. This major is quite new, and I would not have any chance to practice what I learned in class back in my hometown. We don't have any nutrition department in major hospitals. I love my major and would never intent to change that. With extra working opportunity in U.S, I could learn more and help more people. As I work in a large hospital in major city, there are all kinds patients in there. Some of them can't even speak English. I am very helpful for coworkers and other nursing staff.
