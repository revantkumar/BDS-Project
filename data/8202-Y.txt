I strongly support expanding opt for STEM degrees.
1. The typical duration for projects and researches in STEM fields are 3-4 years. If foreign students involved into these projects and lose their visa status in the half way, the contribution they can make to the projects are limited, and it will decrease the value of education and training made by academic sector and industry.
2. Foreign students made big contributions to economy by paying expensive tuition fees, housing rent, cars, supermarkets, restaurants. And OPT extension is actually a major attraction for foreign students. If the extension is no longer exists, it will immediately result in a bad economy influence.
3. Foreign students is not taking away jobs from native students. Since only e-verify companies can sponsor foreign students opt extension, and one of the rule for being e-verified is to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DHS and SSA. This memorandum requires employers to agree to abide by current legal hiring procedures and to follow required procedures in the E-Verify process to ensure that E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. Violation of the terms of this agreement by the employer is grounds for immediate termination of its participation in the program. So this rule ensures companies will provide equal opportunities for both domestic and foreign students. The correct way to say is the job is taken by qualified students with good skills.
