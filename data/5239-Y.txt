Gina Sinnett It seems this administration is intent on circumventing the Congress and the American
People's wishes again by expanding the Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with 
STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief. Why.... Do you not realize that the IT jobs will be taken from American 
citizens by these nonimmigrant students? or do you even care. Our middle class is dying. This administration has killed it.
Under this administration Citizenship is meaningless, our borders are meaningless, and you show more concern for Muslim immigrants in Syria over Christians who are being murdered by Isis. You are doing nothing to stop the genocide of Christians. Don't think this is lost on the American public. Stop the ICEB's proposed rule change NOW.
