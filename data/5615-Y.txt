Chong Li I think it is beneficial for the American high technology companies.
1. The high technology companies are in need of a lot of talented people in STEM. 
2. The companies could save money for the training. Every year, a lot of students have to leave US because they do not get the working visa in the lottery. The companies have to find new people for these positions and train them again.

The benefits is not limited to the companies. All the foreign students contribute a lot to the diversity. They are well educated. The fact of more of them is also a good thing for the good neighbors and the development of the whole society.
