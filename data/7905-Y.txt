Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule making (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate student / international student at University of Arkansas at Little Rock. 40% of the students at my university are Internationals with many of them on F-1 student status. I and many of my colleagues will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule. 

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

I am planning to use OPT after graduation to gain practical experience in the US because this gives me a chance to enhance and apply skills. This STEM extension provides me enough chances to apply for H1B there by extending my stay and willingness to work in US.

I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rule making process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best regards,
