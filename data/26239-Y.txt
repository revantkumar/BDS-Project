I strongly support the proposal for these reasons:

1. The U.S Government is expected to provide opportunities for students to make contributions to the country where they receive a well education.

2. Diversity is quite an essential part of the U.S in all industries.

3. Competition does exist, but it serves more as a push for the development rather than an obstacle.
