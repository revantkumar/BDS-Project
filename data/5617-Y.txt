I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this will allow some of the world's best and brightest students the chance to continue developing skills that not only will benefit them personally but also benefit our national economy. We need these students to help the US stay competitive in the world marketplace, plus to demonstrate to the world that the US is the best place on the planet to come receive the highest quality education and learn the skills needed to advance in your chosen field.

I would like the government to also consider expanding this opportunity not only to students receiving STEM degrees but also to students in the liberal arts. To me, a college graduate with a B.A., I believe in the value of a liberal arts education that broadens students in areas of music, history, languages and other fields. Students coming to study in these fields should also be able to be included in this program.
