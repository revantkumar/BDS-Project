Hi James,

DHS has considered the problem you mentioned and they provide the following term.

"If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers, the employer would be required to ensure that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers in other employers of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area of employment. "

I believe OPT will not drive down wages and this extension is really a win-win rule for American and International students. 

Thanks,
Violet
