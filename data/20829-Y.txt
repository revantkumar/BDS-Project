I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The students who study in U.S universities could keep contributing to U.S. after they graduated.
2. Competition is good to keep the strength of U.S. stand out of the world.
3. Many foreigners such as Albert Einstein make great contribution to the world after they came to U.S.
4. Native workers would not lost their jobs because of the emerging market.
