Gaylin Zeigler This extension of time for foreign STEM workers to be employed goes way beyond the "training" period. It sets up an unfair
competitive advantage over American tech workers trying to enter the 
workplace. The student spaces should be used to train Americans.
The lower wages do nothing but provide extra profits for tech companies that already are making a fortune
ripping off American consumers. The "shortage" of tech workers is a scam; plenty of Americans need work, the industry just 
doesn't want to pay fair wages!
The lack of paying payroll/social security taxes is inexcusable! Americans should be given jobs
and taxes should be paid.
The whole program should be shut down, not just the extension!
This is politics at its worst, no wonder the tech area gives so much money to politicians!
These foreign students need to go home after graduation and help build the economies of their own countries instead of
having them continue to fall behind and require US economic assistance.

This F-1 rule proposal deserves a BIG F- grade on all counts!
