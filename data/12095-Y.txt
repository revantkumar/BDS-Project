The DHS should put into action and expand the OPT for foreign students. I've seen that many people posted comments to disagree it because they said "it should go to the American students". What I want to say that, the american students have no need of this permit in order to work. When a foreign student find a job in a company, the company has to prove that this job can't find a local person to do.
