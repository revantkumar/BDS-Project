Leo Yao I totally support the extension of OPT for STEM students.

As we know, studying and even working in the USA is not easy for international students. Only the top ones could be selected. Other countries such as China and India spent 20 years educating their students and finally made some talents. Every country will welcome them. Nowadays, they come to the USA for free and make a contribution to the USA. Why doesn't America accept them with OPT extension?

Image that, if international students suddenly disappear in SV, the whole world will get influenced. Indeed, it is competitive in the USA, but competition could compel personal development and finally benefit the country. If the top international students are not allowed to stay, native students will not work hard. As a result, the country will leave behind.

Someones say international students will take the places of native students, so they don't like international ones. This opinion is totally wrong. More students doesn't mean less space. The chance of getting a job is decided by the candidate's ability. If a talent in Google is kicked off, will Google hire an untalented person? Of course not. Google will prefer the position to be empty than wasting money to hire an untalented one. My opinion is, more talented students won't diminish the job space, but rather enlarge them. It's easy to understand. More talented students will lead to more productivity. And the USA will develop at a faster speed. And a lot of new positions will be created. It's a virtuoso cycle.

Finally, I wish to express my opinion again. That's is, extension of OPT will collect more talents working for the USA and will lead to the development of America and the world!
