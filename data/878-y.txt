Wei Yang As an Environmental Permit Specialist in state government agency, I am helping US protect the environment! For a complicated federal Nonattainment or Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) application, one year OPT is not long enough to finish the review. I highly support the proposal to extend OPT up to 24 months for STEM majors!
