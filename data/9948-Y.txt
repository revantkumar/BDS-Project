I strongly support the proposal to increase the STEM extension period to 24 months in the DHS Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002. I believe this will bring the best of talents in the tech industry to the country, and help both the student get industry exposure, as well as the industry get the best most inquisitive minds. This must be of course complemented by a reform in the H1B program. 

This 24 month program is useful for students who want to get the required exposure without actually having to worry about a work visa. The ideas and fresh perspective got by international students will be very useful for the industry.

Without this 24 month extension a lot of students would be very hesitant to apply to the United States of America which could lead to a significant drop in the number of international students coming to this country.

With these views in mind, I stand behind the proposal 100%.
