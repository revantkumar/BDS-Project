qinyun LI I strongly agree with this proposal for these reason:
First, this is the stem student which study difficult course which most US citizen will not like to enroll in , this means we help US is this terms of development.
Secondly,many student are willing for this prososal if cancel , it will decrease the number of international students,which US will earn $1000,000,000 from the international students.
Finally, this is only for 3years,not become an US citizen, don't be afraid.Most international student like to go back their hometown for life time.
