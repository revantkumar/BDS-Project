THIS POLICY CAN ONLY BENEFIT THE UNITED STATES. 
I definitely SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. What made the US special? It's the diversity. Because the US is constantly absorbing the most talented personnel. If you close the door, US will eventually lose its advantage. There is always a tendency that the people comes first thinks they own the place and exclude future coming people. Is this really a good thing? Survival of the fittest, that's what the nature has taught us.

2. It is already harder for a foreigner to compete with a native for a job position. If a foreigner gets the job, that's because he/she obviously does have better skills. For the sake of the development of the country, what would you like to see?

3. Extending OPT will only make the better people stay. If a foreigner isn't good enough, he/she will eventually be eliminate. The people who survived the selection will at lease level higher than the average.
