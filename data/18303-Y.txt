I believe OPT STEM extension can benefit regular Americans. On one hand, such extension allows the international talents to stay in the US to contribute to the economy recovery. One the other hand, given the limited quota of H1 working visa, this also allows entrepreneurs to introduce more innovative ideas, which is the key for the Americans to lead the world economy. I don't think this would hurt the unemployment rate in the US, because the US is lacking STEM talents anyway. Big and innovative companies are hungry for those kinds of labors, and it's not a situation that international labor forces are competing with the US local labors.
