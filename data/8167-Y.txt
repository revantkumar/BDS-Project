Qian Zhang I totally support STEM Extension. It definitely has great impact for both side-Country and Foreign Students.

As far as I known, STEM Extension must be a great advantage attract more foreign students, who made great impact for United States Economy. Compared to UK, United States is the better place for foreign students get advanced education. One of the important reason is students can get longer practical work time to improve themselves.

And for United States, a lot of STEM major students already worked for many companies and made a great economic benefit for technology companies. If STEM Extension rule been canceled, it will be disaster to all these technology companies.
