I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

I am Chinese undergraduate student major in computer science, and planning to further my graduate study in the U.S. One of reason that I choose to pursue the master degree in America is the excellent chance to have working experience in world top IT companies, which will make me more competitive in job application when I come back to China. If there is no OPT extension, one year's working time will make the decision of getting a master degree in the U.S become less attractive since my undergraduate school is among the top schools in China, where good master education can also be provided. I believe with the STEM OPT extension, the U.S. academic sector can surely remain competitive globally.
