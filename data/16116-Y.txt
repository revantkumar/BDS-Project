The source of the power of Unite State is the immigrant policy. As the most powerful country in the world, unlike Japan, China or Russia, America was not built by an emperor, but thousands of diligent immigrants. Actually, this always an good way to force young more energy. Look around, diligent, conscious, steady, these personality, which almost upon everybody before World War II, are hardly to find today. In a easy environment, people always become lazy.
