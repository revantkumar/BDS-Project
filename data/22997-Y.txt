I find a lot of people think the opt extension will lead to the increase of unemployment rate for US citizens. They blame the unemployment rate increase to the OPT program and internal students.That is absolute falsehood, on its face. As US citizens, we should consider about our own problems. If you were good enough, why do the employers still need to hire international students? If you were good enough, why do you need to worry about losing your job? If you were good enough, why are you afraid of being stolen the job by international students? Such a kind of viewpoint only reflects that some of us disincline either to work hard by themselves or let other get a job.
On the other hand, it is difficult for a foreign student to get a job, and the phenomenon that international students take US citizens' job does not exist. Give my own example to explain it. As a HR, I usually use a higher standard to evaluate an international student than a native when I give them a interview. A international student will finally get a job through layers of screening and examination, which means they should pass a more strict and harsher selection process than US citizen employees.
Diversity keeps our society dynamic and creative, so I am a supporter of STEM extension and United States should open mind and take this good proposal.
