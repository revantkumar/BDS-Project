I'm a Master student in Electrical Engineering from UCLA. It is this STEM policy that made me come to UCLA two years ago.
A foreign diploma is not as meaningful or attractive as the diploma plus the post-graduate training. 
First of all, the tuition is too high for international students that if they cannot make money in US, they will pay the amount of money for tuition that they can never make for a few years. This will stop most of the international students since the funding for international students is even tighter to get.
Secondly, the knowledge that is learnt in universities is not very applicable if the students directly go back to their own countries. But if they have chances to get into the real industry in US, it will become a nice bridge between their local industry and the advanced knowledge from universities.
Finally, in my current company, it is also very hard to find good candidates. We interviewed tens of people to fill one position because the position is so technical and it has very high requirements on knowledge that most candidates regardless of nationality don't have. If this STEM extension get vacated, it will cause a problem in many companies on business including the company I'm working for.

Hence, I highly recommend to propose this rule for STEM OPT extension or even longer. This will make a win-win result for both the international students and the United States.
