Yue Wu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

1. This can benefit US Academic sector
As a student from China, one of the biggest thing attracts me to come to study in US is the OPT program. OPT can provide student with lots in field experience. But only one year instead of previous two years program is too short for most of people to gain real experience. This will make US academic sector less competitive.

2. Competition is not a bad thing
Some people are concerned about that more international student will make a lot more competition in STEM field. This is not necessary. In the company I am working for, as long as you have the skills and proper experience, you will be hired. And company always prefer local than international student. Most international student is not even competitive as local, as these students have disadvantages in culture, languages etc. And from the perspective of the STEM field, only competition can make a industrial field more prosperous. Imaging only one Apple company in the world, it will stop inventing new cool devices because it doesn't have to learn new technology to compete with others. This can slow STEM field in US globally.

3. 24 months is very necessary
24 months is very necessary because most of the project in STEM take quite long time. Every company in STEM field requires employee trained before starting the real work into the production. The training process usually take from 3 month to 6 month. Imaging you hire someone, trained him well but can only let him work for less than one year. And after that, you have to hire someone else. By making OPT 24 months, it can save employer lots and lots resources.

Therefore, the proposal from DHS is highly beneficial for the whole US country.
