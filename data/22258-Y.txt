I strongly support the new 24-month STEM OPT rule. 

U.S will suffer from tremendous financial loss by revoking old STEM OPT rule and failing to publish the new one. Now, there are more than 400,000 STEM students studying in U.S. in either master degree or undergraduate degree. The average tuition per year they spend is more than $30,000. Totally U.S education system receives 12 billion USD per year. One of the most important reasons they choose U.S. for receiving advanced education is because it provides the best post-graduation training opportunity. If U.S. education system cannot provide STEM OPT extension in the future. It will lose in the competition against other countries that are providing it. Considering that a large portion of STEM students will abandon their future plan to study in U.S. That is a huge impact on the current U.S education ecosystem that has already adapted to wide internationalization.
