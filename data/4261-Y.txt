I strongly vote for the implementation of STEM OPT extension for following reasons:
1. Companies in US will benefit a lot from more resources of outstanding and well-educated international employees. 
2. Employees from different background will bring more diversity in each industry, which is crucial for the development. 
3. More competition can stimulate and improve not only international employees but also native US employees. 
4. More well-educated international employees are likely to found more start-ups, which will provide more work places. 
5. Economic can be stimulated by the consumption of international employees. 
6. The act is a symbol of the American spirit of "all men are born equal".
