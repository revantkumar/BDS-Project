Although I am a non-STEM international student, after reading through the rule thoroughly in the view of a current law school student, I strongly support this rule.

First of all, this rule proposed a reasonable background for extending STEM OPT. Back to 2008 when the extension was proposed, there was no doubt that it did save American economies from the weakest point in the past decades. Economy recovery should appreciate the contribution from international students. In my knowledge of American people around me, most of natives are in support of this good rule, as it does benefit the country itself in academy, education, economy and industry. As I can see, many negative comments contain few logic and reasonable providers, so I believe they are purely from some minor group's complaints.

Secondly, this is not to block American people's working opportunities, this is, actually guarantee that American people can do jobs that they are most suited. For a law school student, I do think I have the obligation to respond to justice and help maintain the spirit of law in the country.

So, I strongly support this rule.
