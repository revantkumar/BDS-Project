STEM OPT is crucial to those international students who want to stay and work in the US. As a manager in a tech company, I have recruited a lot of international STEM degree graduates and they have shown great work ethic. They are talented, hard working and honest. With out STEM OPT these students will have to go back to their country after graduation, which means we are losing these talented people to India, China and so on. Keeping these STEM students is key for US companies to be in the leading position, so I urge US government to pass the proposal and DON NOT cancel STEM OPT.
