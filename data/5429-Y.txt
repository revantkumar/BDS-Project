Priyanka Wasnik I support the OPT extension for 24 months.

I graduated in Dec 2014 with a PhD in Chemical Engineering and began working in Feb 2015 with an Engineering company. I had full scholarship thorough out my PhD program which amounts to $100,000 just in form of stipend apart from the tuition waiver that I received. In my office, I am the only foreigner so they had no idea what H1B is. Also they needed to see my performance before they could think of filing for my H1B. The company that I work for (my office is a part of the company) is e-verified and files H1Bs but now it can only be filed for the year 2016. My office/ company is ready to file my H1B for 2016 which can be filed by Apr 2016 and be applied from Oct 2016. I need a work permit till then. The OPT extension gives me and students like me an opportunity to work in the US legally while waiting for H1B application and then its approval. Since last year, OPT now has a quota system again. For students who don't get through the quota the first time, a 17 to 24 month OPT extension gives enough time to work with no hassles and file for H1B the year after. 

Without the OPT extension, I or students like me would have no legal work status and would have to go back to our home country. It would be a waste of time, money and talent for the US government to invest in people and let them go to their native country without contributing enough to the US economy. I came here because it's a land of opportunities and a country made up of immigrants. After spending 6.5 years in the US if I have to go back just due to work permit issues created by not so effective immigration rules I wont be in a position to ask anyone in my country to come here to study.
