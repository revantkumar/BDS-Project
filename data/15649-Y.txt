I strongly SUPPORT extending the OPT-extension. 

I work in an electronic commerce company. We are short of qualified software engineers. This year we hired some new grads. They are well trained, learning fast and working hard. With their help, we launched several projects. To support these projects, hundreds of job positions are created, such as customer service specialists, buyers and fulfillment associate positions, etc. 

If the OPT-extension is cancelled, half of my colleagues would leave, and it would be a huge loss to my company. 

With this comment, I urge you implement this new rule. Thank you for your consideration and time.
