As an international graduated student with a Master Degree of Engineering. I, personally, consider that the STEM OPT extension helps the talented foreigners students with higher education background and top-level talents better serve US industry, academic and economy.

OPT extension does not mean that all foreigners will take over local job opportunities. The American local company still have the initiative in hands. Those, who get the working opportunity, help boost the U.S. economy in a long run.
