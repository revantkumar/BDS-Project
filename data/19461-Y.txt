I highly support this proposal for the following reasons:
1. The science and economy improvement of United States are based on the fair and reasonable competition among employees. As long as a certain employee can use his knowledge and skills to make contribution to the building of the states. Especially, the International students in STEM, he should get the chance of longer OPT extension.
2. According to the longer OPT extension, American universities, institutes or any educational department can attract more talented International Students, which can strongly push the local education, economy and culture forward.
3. An equal competing environment is apparently an advantage for American Society, every department needs a real competitive clerk, rather than the one just protected by any policies.
