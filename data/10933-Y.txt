I am for the regulation to extend stem opt. Since America is always regarded as a freeland for people to pursue their dream despite discrimination of race. High-educated prospective immigrants with professional skills should be helped to stay in the US. Because these people possibly are persistent and share common value of American dream as they tend to study hard and work hard. They should be accepted to increase the diversity and help America develop sustainably by improving technological innovation.
