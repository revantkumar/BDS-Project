Why am I NOT surprised at this?

Our school systems have failed miserably at educating students HERE for such prestigious positions, involving Science, Tech, Engineering and Math. A good majority can't pass 10th grade reading and writing levels, let alone STEM!

It just goes to show, that Americas education system has failed and this will only get worse. Then again, it's all based on parental guidance, which as we are witnessing today, is also a dismal failure!

Do I support this?...What other options are there for employers who are seeking qualified people?

The ONLY thing we're good at in this country, is talking and texting on a cell phone and a lot can't even do that right!

There ARE people who cannot afford an education in the finer institutions, that should be given the opportunity first. 
Unfortunately for a lot of them though, they may not qualify for a grant or are preoccupied by family related obligations, that prevents them from the education required to fill these positions.

It's sad to see that DHS is seeking personnel outside our borders to fill these positions, instead of seeking people HERE to education them HERE, so that they could remain living and working HERE!

Bottom Line...
Giving Americans the opportunities, will make our country economically strong. Giving it to Foreigners will only make their countries stronger.
Is that what DHS wants...for America to fail and become "Third World"?
