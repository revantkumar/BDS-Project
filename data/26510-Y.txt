I am a postdoc research scientist working at world's best university in Cambridge, MA. 
I strongly support OPT STEM extension.

To my knowledge, OPT is not a real job visa, but a training process is part of the school education. OPT plays an important role in the U.S. education industry. OPT keeps and strengthens the global competitiveness and attractions to the smartest youngsters. These people will not only have directly economic impacts, such as tuition fees, housing rentals, international travels, etc., but also create thousands of jobs.

In addition, since the period of OPT is very short, employers are not likely to hire someone who may work only for a short time. Therefore, OPT extension would not take any job positions, but create more jobs for the U.S.
