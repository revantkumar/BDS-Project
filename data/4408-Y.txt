I think OPT for non-immigrant students is really important and necessary. International students coming to US are not only for learning advanced technology but also obtaining working experience. OPT is a good chance to start their career. It has to be fair for all student in US to have opportunity to work. International students are great employee sources for many companies. I think american companies really need international workers and also US government needs.
My point is: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees Is A Great Idea.
