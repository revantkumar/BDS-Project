I do support the opt-extension. Over many years, foreign workers contributed a lot to US technical industry. If we lose these foreign force, we will lose the contribution they brought. Without policies like OPT and OPT extension, talent foreign students will leave US.That will hurt a large amount of technical companies and cause irreparable damage to US economy. Don't let it happen!!
