One, save the money in this program for USA citizens. Already our graduate schools are filled with foreign teachers unable to speak English in an understandable manner. They show favoritism to foreign nationals for assistantships and other jobs within their departments. Often waiting until the very last minute to 'select' persons for these jobs and they go to more foreign individuals where our USA minorities can't wait that long to secure support as they have to pay their own fees.

Right now, anything keeping foreign nationals in our universities and colleges is detrimental to our own people. Quite frankly, we already give foreign nations enough US taxpayer money so if these foreign nation want their offspring to attend our schools and universities, let them pay the full load and then get them back on their way to their own country.
