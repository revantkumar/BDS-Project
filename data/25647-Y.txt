I strongly appreciate the decision of extending opt for 24 months.This time gives international students to get some practical working experience on their courses and to improve their skills, international students feels united states as land of opportunities,where we can be given a chance to prove ourselves. Education is taught every where but one can improve their skills only with practical working experience, people want to expand their skills with latest technologies as this is possible in developed nations.students feel opt period is a great opportunity for them.
