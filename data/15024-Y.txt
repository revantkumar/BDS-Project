Jiarong Zhang I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. As a statistics student, I could say two thirds of my classmates are international students. Our tuition are the bulk of the income of my department. The reason why so many international students choose US instead of other countries as their destination, one of the important reasons is the attractive OPT extension rule. STEM extension provides international student more time and chance to improve one's own competitiveness. Without the attractive STEM extension, US will lose lot of international students, and as a natural result, US's educational institutions will lose competitive power. Without international students' tuition, my department has to cut its expense and some US people will lose their work too. This proposal creates a win-win situation.
