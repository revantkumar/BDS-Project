Howard Zhang I believe this new rule will benefit universities in the United States. If this rule fails, it will decrease the amount of STEM students significantly and reduce the attractiveness of American schools for future international students.

First, the international students will increase the cultural diversity in school. Diversity is always an important factor in the success of American education. This will help develop international perspective and creativity of students. 

Second, STEM students will enhance competitiveness of American universities. Most STEM students have math and engineering degrees. They play an very important role in university research.

Third, STEM students will bring a lot of revenues for universities for sure.

Finally, I also want to mention that STEM students are always talents from accredited institutes. They are mainly from China and India nowadays. They have super low possibility of participating in terrorism or harming national security of United States. In fact OPT students can not work in any sensitive institute which is related to national security or confidential information. So STEM students definitely have no threat to United States.
