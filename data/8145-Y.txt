I think this is a great proposal for all the international students. I totally support it.

I am personally under OPT right now, I am working as a contract to hire software engineer. The initial contract will last for one year, possibly will be extended up to two years. Without sufficient OPT extension, I will not able to finish my duty for the company I am working with. It will definitely affect myself and the company. For me, I want to be successful in my career. For company, they spent some time to train me and want me to work for the company for a long time. I think both sides do not want to end the relationship due to some objective factors, such as insufficient working duration.

As a conclusion, I wish this proposed rule can become effective ASAP.
