Hi, I am happy to welcome the new OPT extension rule for F1 students. If somehow this is rejected, at least please continue with existing 17 months extension. Because 12 months of practical experience is not sufficient enough to gain the real world knowledge, which is the main agenda in US higher education system for most of the F1 students. 

This rule will help major student community and indirectly the US economy as well. Please consider passing this regulation.

Thank you.
