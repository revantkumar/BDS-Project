It's just unfair to reject foreigners to work for the United States. In my opinion, this is an open and free country where all the people should be treated equally. By the way, they are picked by the company which means they satisfy the standards of theirs, and it is kind of win-win. Moreover, they work for company to make more profits is do good to the country too.
