Optional Practical Training Program allows employers to hire foreign students for up to one year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training when they return to their home countries. Instead, his proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge for longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they receive their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's difficult enough for American workers, especially recent US graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more arduous by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
