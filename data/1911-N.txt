I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. 

Because of these illegal policies enacted by several Presidents without Congressional approval, my children and grandchildren can not find the type of jobs that were available to me and my parents to make a better life for our families. Some of them are just getting by and others are deeply in debt due to the discrimination caused by these illegal policies.
