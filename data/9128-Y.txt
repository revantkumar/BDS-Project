I strongly support this rules for three main reasons: 
1. It is a great opportunity to give every one a equal chance, no matter they are Americans or Internationals. An talented students need a equal opportunities to practices their knowledge after they graduate.

2. It is a great opportunity for companies to reduce cost and earn benefits if they hire international students do Technology job.

3. Internationals are mostly hard working and dedicate to job, they deserve this opportunities for STEM 
extension.
