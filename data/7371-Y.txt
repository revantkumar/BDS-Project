Christine Souza We don not need all these foreign STEM workers coming into our country taking away American jobs. I was appalled when I heard that a successful corporation like Disney was forcing American Workers to train foreign STEM workers to fill their own jobs leaving them out of work. What is happening to our country? American people are hurting. Our wages are stagnate and REAL unemployment is through the roof! We should NOT be bringing foreign worker into this country when we have Americans who would love those jobs. Put AMERICANS first!
