I strongly support this extension!

Obviously U.S. employers will benefit from STEM students with longer OPT period, because they can have more talented students to choose from. 

Also, nowadays China and India have become two largest market for the US companies to make money from. Chinese and Indian students take up a major of STEM students. So we can see without longer extension of OPT bosses in the US can hardly hire Chinese and Indian students to help grow their asian market.
