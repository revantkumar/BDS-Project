Firstly,it is unreasonable to impute unemployment to international students, on the contrary, the international students have brought many job opportunities in the U.S since they(especially STEM students) have accelerate the development of the high-tech area , which are eager for workers in recent years.

Moreover, if we look back at the developing process of the U.S, we can find that it is its openness which makes this country concentrated the wisdom from all over the world, thus it's necessary for the government to keep this openness in order to attract more elite to come to this country.
