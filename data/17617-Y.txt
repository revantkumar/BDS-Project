I strongly oppose to ending the program. It does need to be improved so that work permission is granted to those who really qualify. However, we as a nation do need foreign STEM workers. 

The STEM extension program does not grant any permanent status to any foreign STEM worker. The permission only lasts for three years, enough for US companies to utilize a great resource of STEM workers in addition to American students. 

It is irrational to object to employing foreigners when they are not really taking away jobs from us. They are helping our economy at a time when our education system does not produce enough STEM students to fill the job positions. 

I object to the idea that "we should only give American jobs to Americans." Most of us here have ancestors from Europe, Africa, Latin America, Asia, etc. Immigrants and foreign workers have been contributing to our economy to this day.
