I came to United States 3 years ago, and my major is computer science, which is a STEM major. I will graduate next year, so it is very important for me and the other international students to have OPT and OPT extension to accumulate working experiences after I get my degree in USA. In face, OPT and its extension have already existed for a long time, and help thousands of international students to get great interns in the companies in US

I strongly support that OPT 24-month extension instead of OPT 17-month extension, since most students in the colleges of the US are graduated in the summer, if we consider the H1B working visa, 24-month extension may give international students another chance to win the H1B lottery. 

In the past 3 years, I have met lots of friends in United State, I would like to have interns after I graduate or even to have working visas after I finish my interns, so the role of OPT and its extension are extremely important for international students like me, so I strongly support the improvements of OPT and its extension.
