A. Borensztein I would like to encourage the DHS and the OMB to approve the proposed amendment to the F-1 STEM OPT regulations. I have witnessed firsthand both as a student and as a young professional the major contributions that international STEM graduates from American universities have to offer as productive members of the US workforce. Approving the proposed rules is the right thing to do, not only in the interest of American industries and universities, but also to reaffirm the value of a diverse, multicultural workforce.
