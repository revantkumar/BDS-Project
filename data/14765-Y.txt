I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
There are so many talented international experts in STEM fields and they did a great job in the past years and they contributed a lot for the USA economy. Many of them went through the process of OPT-H1B. I think it is a good idea to extend the OPT in order to enhance their chances to stay at high tech companies and make more contributions to the development of USA. That is how our country become strong, right?
