As a matter of fact, everything has its pros and cons. In this OPT thing, I would more likely vote for it. Shortage can be much more obvious, which is it jeopardizes the working opportunity for American citizen. However, if we take it from three new aspects, we might find a new and opposite conclusion. First, we have to admit that American is a very special country which consists of different cultures, different people and different languages from its establishment. And it is it which makes America the most powerful country in the world today. Second, a more generous attitude will attract more talents worldwide devoting themselves to the development of America. Third, all the achievements made by human today derive from the fact of we struggling under pressure. It used to come from the environment, and now it is from ourselves. We live too much comfortable of having most of the things we want since we were a child, that is way too much from being a human. We human should always look forward to new opportunity and new chance with endless curiosity to make our live even better, now that curiosity is being diminished by subtle living satisfaction. We should be warned of this, we should be happy that there are still bunch of geeks who love to create with their talents and when facing them, people are more likely to be shown what should they really pursue.
