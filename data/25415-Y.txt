I strongly support that the proposal should be approved. Students with STEM degrees in USA, who have learnt the latest Internet technologies, are intending to make great contributions to USA's IT development. Yes, this may lead to more competition. However, competition does not mean a totally bad thing. For those who are willing to take the competitions will become more excellent, more productive and more competitive. The enhancement of a single man makes the enhancement of the world. There are still many statement to support me. I just put some of them here to make my claim and my support to the proposal.

Thanks.
