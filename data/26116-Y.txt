I do support the extension. I was a CS student and now i am working for a software company.
From my own experience, i would say that this extended OPT STEM rule will benefit both the F-1 non-immigrant students and the U.S. technology companies. The stem students are definitely need more than a year to participate in the real life works but not just practice in the college, and this extension would bring them more time to work on the real jobs. For the technology companies like google, facebook and amazon, these great companies spent months to training their new employees, and without the extension, the hiring process would be painful.
To sum up, this extension brings many benefits for United states companies and international students, so it should be approved.
