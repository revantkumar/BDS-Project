In my current company, 50% of the engineers are foreigners. All of them were educated in US and either in their OPT right now, or converted from OPT to H1B. Our company is making hundreds of million annual profit, and we are just one of the million high-tech companies in the nation who are heavily relying on qualified engineers. Losing those employee currently in OPT, or future OPT employees would have significant impact to the US economy. If US still wants to keep its number one position in the field of technology, extending OPT for these great engineers is one of the most effect approaches.
