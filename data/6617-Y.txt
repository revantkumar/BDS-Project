Dongyun Zhang In my opinion, what makes US such a strong and powerful country today is it's inclusiveness of diversity. The nations embraces the elites from all the countries, absorbing the brilliant ideas from all around the world. That's where creativity comes from, and that's what international students can deliver. The nation have been taking advantage of what comes from the world, without fears of facing the challenge from those place, and that can only be achieved by great nations.

International students have been winning their places because they have proved that they are better than their competitors, better in making contribution to the nation. I believe many of us have received the code of conduct training from the employers, which includes working with diversity. It is because that the people who lead the industry know that diversity brings creativity, thus leading to innovation. Without that kind of diversity, the companies cannot know what the world needs, which in turns harms not only the growth of their services and income, but also what the nations can give to everyone involved in the society.

As for the education, many schools in the US now accept international students, which also brings different cultures in to the classes. Native American students can benefit from this because they can broaden their views by communicating and cooperating with international students, which is helpful for their future, worldwide careers. The best way to get to know different cultures is to get to know people who come from there, and that helps all the students, native and international, to take a view of the world from more perspetives.

After all, having the citizenship or not, the key point is to work hard for the nation, to prove that what we do for the country can match what the country gives us.
