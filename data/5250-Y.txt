The reason companies want to hire international students is the students have the skills and can do the work, while there is lack of US workers who have the skill set needed.

To not hire international students does not solve the part "there is lack of US workers who have the skill set needed".

If the extension is removed, then the companies will be forced to seek labor overseas and move more business out of the states. This is already happening in Silicon Valley where the tech companies hire people in Canada to avoid dealing with the visas.

If US really doesn't want to keep the talents trains from US universities, and have them create more opportunities and hire US citizens, then shut down the whole OPT program. Completely forbid F1 students to have work employment.

The only outcome is big firms moving business away from US, but not increase employment rate. Lack of skill set has nothing to do with F1 students. The senators and those who oppose OPT extension should work harder on education reformation.
