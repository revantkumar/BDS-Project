I strongly support this rule. After reviewing the most objection, I find the most mentioned reasons are opt stem workers take the opportunity from citizen because the employers take advantage and pay lower salary to opt workers, which is not true.

Firstly, most big companies hire employees based on their experience and competence instead of considering budget first. The fortune 500 companies hiring more international workers than small firms and they can afford the salary. What the objectors supposed to do is not blaming the opt extension rule but urge a stricter progress to filter out those who abuse the system. DHS might require more supported documents to approve the extension.

Secondly, those who are eligible for applying opt stem extension are high skilled workers and already have some experience before their application. Because of the H1b lottery recent years, some employees lost the opportunity for status transfer. Passing the 24 month rules will benefit companies that want to hold their valued employees.

Lastly, stem opt attracts thousands of students to apply for US universities and promote the education system as well. Those scientific and technical program in school will definitely contribute to the development of the countries and GDP.

There's someone who abuse the system, but that's not the most, and it can be improved easily by amending the application requirements. People should be fair and have no bias towards most people who dedicate themselves to their career and make contribution to the county.

I wish the this rule take effect as soon as possible.
