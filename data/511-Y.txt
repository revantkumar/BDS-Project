My best friend is an international student. She majors in computer science and works extremely hard. But she has to be sent home even though she found a job just because she didn't win the lottery and her opt expired. I know some people always say immigrants "steal" their job. But STEM program is only for educated people with highly technical skills that the US needs the most. These smartest minds get together, create more jobs for America and help with the economy. Pushing them away only end up with the result that these smart people work for other countries and these countries become bigger competitors of the U.S.
