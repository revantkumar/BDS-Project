Jenn Chou It would be a good idea that if the OPT of F1 students gets extension. International students don't take the jobs of American's. They just do the job of those US citizens don't want to do or they are not qualified to do. As far as we know, most of the companies consider US citizens first when they are hiring people. It would be such great loss for the whole US economy and society in science and technology, even education and recreation, every field in this country, if international student have to leave before they fulfill their dreams to make this country stronger. Some US citizens blame international student taking their jobs. But that is not the right the way to survive or get the job back. The right way is to build up skills and make you strong so that you could be competitive enough. You would be hot and a lot of companies would want to hire you as long as you are qualified, strong and competitive. They would be happier to hire you if you are US citizen and also qualified for the job. Stop blaming foreigners taking your jobs! It is just like you can't blame your opponent, blame your team or blame the offical for losing the game. The only way leads to a winner is to make yourself strong. Parents and Grandparents care for their children and young generation. But the protection wouldn't last forever if your children don't work hard enough or if they are not qualified. Build the children with strong skills and competitive ability so that no foreigners would take their jobs, instead of blaming foreigners. The strong young generation with high responsibility for the family and country is the hope of this country.
