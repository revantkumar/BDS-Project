I support expanding training opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees for four reasons.

First, with the expanded OPT training opportunities, USA will be competitive in the world attracting top scientists and engineers.
Second, with best STEM students from the world enrolled in the school classes, native USA students will be inspired to work harder and learn more.
Third, USA schools will benefit from the increased quality and quantity of STEM students both financially and intellectually.
Fourth, this country is chased by other countries in the fields of science and engineers, and desperately needs top workers in these fields in order to sustain its leading position in the world.
