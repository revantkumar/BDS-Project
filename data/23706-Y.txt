I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons: if there are less skilled international students in IT companies in the U.S., there must be very bad influence on economy especially in this economic recovery stage. And it is the spirit that everyone is equal that makes today's America. Talented students deserve a good job regardless of their nationalities.
