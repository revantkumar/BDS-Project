I strongly support this rule. 

One should still remember the great recession in 2008, when the U.S. labor market lost 8.4 million jobs. If what ever will cause American people lose jobs, that's bad economy, not STEM students.

Actually the "old" OPT extension rule, which was effective from 2008, was proposed to recover the economy. And today, as President Obama says proudly, "our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis."

Students from all over the world come to U.S for her great diversity and innovation, learn from her knowledge and culture, and contribute to her success. Everyone should welcome this new OPT extension rule, as it's a sign showing the values we stand for, and it will certainly benefit further the economy. If you haven't found a job yet, work hard!
