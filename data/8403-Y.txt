I hereby support this because F-1 students with STEM degrees are essential to most of technology companies in the United States. And our country's economy heavily depends on those technology companies. 
These companies usually hire STEM students with OPT for doing some low-pay but important job. If the extension doesn't exist, many of the STEM students with great skills won't choose to stay because one-year is too short for actually learn or contribute anything real to a company. People usually have a job longer than a year or two. Companies doesn't like to recruit that often too because it will be a waste of money to find and train a new employee.
As the most advanced country in the world, the equality plays a big part. Providing better training opportunity for F-1 Students with STEM Degrees is showing fairness to your follow visitors who spend lots of money for the degrees.
Looking back in history, facts that are well known is this great country built on immigrants and some non-immigrants' hard work. Each era there are some certain type of workers that service the country, doing the work that no citizen would do. Now in 21th century, our country needs more strong skilled STEM workers than ever, and this extension is indeed the one the country needs, I hope it will go through.
