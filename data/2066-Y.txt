I don't think you are telling the truth. I am a graduate student of stem major and as what I am seeing, only 5 percent of American people choose the CS/EE major and the other 95% are mostly Indians and Chinese. How can you only provide the jobs for those 5 percent Americans and throwing out other 95% foreigners? If so, then thousands and thousands of engineers will lose their jobs due to their nationality. There are so many IT companies in USA, and if they only hire the American people, that's far from enough!
So I strong SUPPORT the proposal!!!! At least provide both Americans and foreigners the same platform. Be justice to all people! 1 year for opt is not enough!!!
