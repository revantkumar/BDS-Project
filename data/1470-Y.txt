Dr Pawan Singhal This rule will increase the amount of highly skilled workforce available to companies in need of STEM workers. These workers help companies innovate in various areas, and also benefit the economy.

The rule in no way encourages shifting jobs market to foreign workers. Since the companies are paying the same salary to foreign workers as US citizens, there is no incentive for companies to favor foreign workers over domestic workers. In contrast, the rule can actually encourage creating more job positions by providing a viable visa solution for foreign citizens to run startup companies. This is not only good for innovation and economy, but also creates job positions for both domestic workers and foreign workers.

Thus, I believe the rule will be beneficial to the US and people who live in US, and highly support this rule.
