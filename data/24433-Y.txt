I support this rule.

I can't believe that some of u guys curse the other supporters just because u are the opposers. 

This country need talented people to contribute and push it forward. If u can't do the jobs, pls let some others do that. If u vacate all of the STEM students, do u think u or your child can find a job much easier? Definitely NOT. So u are just attacking the policy just because u can't benefit from it, right?
