Faya Z. I strongly support this rule. Opt extension give international students more opportunity to gain working experience on their field in the US, no matter they will stay in the US or back to their home country after OPT extension. To give students this opportunity bring more positive effects to them and the United States. 

As we know, there are so many technology companies hire international students. It does not means they take American's jobs away, it because more international students study STEM major, less American. Companies willing to hire more Americans, but they are not that many people can do the job or do the job well. Without those students, many companies would not developing their new products, even start their companies. International students can fill this gaps and help the economies grow. 

For Americans, it is very important to understand OPT extension does not means immigration, OPT is temporary work authorization. They pay the tax, not waste our sources, even not get too benefits as a tax payer. They can not vote, can not drive without legal document, can not work outside of their major etc. They just have the opportunities to gain work experiences, and at this moment need to fight this right.
