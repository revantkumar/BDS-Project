Santosh Reddy Chada The STEM OPT is one very good opportunity for foreign students to get some practical experience for what they have learnt. It also gives students an opportunity to get an H1B status and also gives companies a chance to not lose their employees because of going out of status. So I strongly support the STEM extension and feel it has to be extended.
