If corporations cannot refrain from arguing that they should be able to hire the foreign-born Science & Engineering graduates of U.S. universities (thus reducing labor costs), very few should be allowed to be admitted in the first place. The vast majority of those slots ought to be filled with U.S.-born students while admitting the Leo Szilards, Eugene Wigners and John von Neumanns. 

Top U.S.-born students are heeding the advice of the market, parents and older siblings and avoiding fields which their government has flooded with foreign talent. Need confirmation? Check the names of the faculty at science and engineering departments across the country. For faculty less than about 50 years of age, a large fraction have foreign names. It's not because of a shortage of U.S.-born folks with high IQs and an interest in STEM fields and definitely not because the foreigners are superior. The situation in industry is similar, although not nearly so lopsided (yet). 

For further confirmation, the 2-20-2013 article in The Atlantic by Jordan Weissmann entitled "The Ph.D Bust: America's Awful Market for Young Scientists-in 7 Charts" makes it clear that importation of STEM graduates to the U.S. does a disservice to U.S. citizens in those fields or who may be considering entering them.

I urge the replacement of this and all such programs that favor hiring foreigners in preference to Americans with a program that yearly grants permanent resident visas to only those 1000 or so foreigners of extraordinary ability (and their nuclear family) who show a willingness to assimilate to become Americans.
