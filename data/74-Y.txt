I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. Stem F-1 students, especially graduate students, who are educated by good US universities, are valuable resource if they can work for US companies after graduation. It will be a waste of resource if they lose their chance to extend their OPT.
2. One of the key factors that US being the strongest country in the world is diversity. International students is an important part of diversity in STEM related industry, which contributes a healthy competition so that US companies improve their roles in the world.
3. As far as I`m concerned, the 24 months STEM OPT Extension is win-win to both F-1 students and United States. I know some people will feel threatened, but I really think the approval of the OPT Extension is a good thing and it will make United States stronger.
