Yash Usgaonkar The following are reasons I feel the OPT period should be maintained or extended for F-1 students:
1) Without the OPT, there will be a huge drop in the number of students who seek to pursue higher education in the United States. This will result in a collapse in the education system in the United States, as diversity will be at an all time low. Additionally, the resource pool for the American economy will also face a huge set back.
2) F1 students contribute to technological advancements. This is what the STEM program was set up for, and without the OPT, there will be no motivation for students to get involved in STEM courses.
3) Without the OPT, F-1 students will seek higher education in countries where policies are more student friendly. In a way, America will become unwelcoming, and the cost vs. learning trade-off will become unstable, forcing international students to seek education elsewhere.
4) Without the OPT, the average time an F-1 student gets to work in the US and contribute to its economy will be reduce drastically. I do not think this will work in anyone's favor.
5) The best companies in the world seek out the best talent. Scrapping the OPT would mean depleting their resource pool.
