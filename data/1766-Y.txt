I strongly support this rule with the following reasons.
The OPT Stem Extension Formal Training Program and Customized mentoring procedure and training rule should be simplified for the benefit of small employers as well and should reduce the unnecessary documentation work
Cap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and should be retained
Welcome the new proposals and without this the students will leave the US and there will be brain drain and students will be losing the touch on the Stem degree advancements and experience
It will make a dent in the student career and resume, if the Cap-Gap is Relief is not retained
Anyhow, if they are selected in H1b, they have to come back and work after 6 months. If this relief is there, it will avoid unnecessary travel and unnecessary lack of continuity in employment
