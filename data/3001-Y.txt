I do believe the nation will benefit from having international students working here. Most of those students are hardworking young folks. They can help keep the U.S strong and all the U.S. employers can benefit from the workers with different background. 

When I was in school, in my class(science major), most of the students are international. I don't think these students are stealing jobs from Americans. Americans always have their choice to learn these majors and find a job easily.

As far as I know, most of the international worker, they are dedicated with their jobs and complain little. I don't see any reason to send off these talented and hardworking people out of the country. It will be huge loss if do so.
