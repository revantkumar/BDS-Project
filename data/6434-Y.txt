Changyu Deng, Linear Tech The new rule is definitely good for international students and U.S. employers. For example, I graduated on 3/20/2015 and have been working for an IC company in San Jose since 5/18/2015. Right now, I am working on several projects which will last at least 3 years. My boss cares for opt extension a lot because company already spent money and time training me to be a regular employee. If opt extension doesn't exist anymore. That means they have to hire someone else to take over my projects. However, this process takes a lot of time and usually causes delay or even failure of projects, which hurts company a lot!
If new rule extends opt-extension to 24 months, international students have much more chances to try H1B lottery. As a result, companies are more stable and can retain/hire anyone who is competent for the job.
