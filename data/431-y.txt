Mengqing He I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First of all, diversity is very important for the US, which makes US the leader of the world. Previously so many talents from other countries got huge success. If the OPT extension is cancelled, there won't be many international students. And you can see those European countries, who do not have this benefits, are much less prosperous than the US. 

Second, the government should let these students who learned knowledge from US universities have chance to make contributions to the US. Otherwise I think it is a waste of education resource. When they get employed, they pay very high tax and bring consumption, which brings benefits to American economy.

Third, competition always exists, but it is good to make the world better. It can make those American citizens who do not have any skill learn and improve themselves, so the average level will get higher. Both international students and US citizens work for US, and make US better and better.
