Xiyao Chen I strongly SUPPORT this proposal!

The reason is:

1.The government should let the international students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Competition does exist, but most international students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics didn't find the low salary job which decrease the opportunity of native people, always they find the jobs that don't have enough American to do.

3. Competition is not a bad thing because competition can help U.S. to improve the ability of all people and improve the ability of competition for the whole world.
