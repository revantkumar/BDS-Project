Someone argues that this rule is for large firm to hire "lower wage" employees. However as I saw, most of these firms hires with very competitive wages and benefits. These firms are usually among the Forbes America's Best Employers list. They really need to attract people globally to do challenging work to remain competitive. Without this new OPT rule, these companies might move a lot of job opportunities abroad to hire internationally. This is not good for US economy in the long run.
