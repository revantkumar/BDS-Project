Mr. Obama,

As a long time supporter and constituent I have been pleased with some of the work you have done since you have been in office. However, when it comes to students being permitted to remain in the United States and to be allowed to take jobs away from Americans I am very displeased with your position. 

AT&T employee who lost his job when his job was sent to India and was subsequently laid off. I feel very strongly about these foreigners taking American jobs, here and abroad--it is likely consistent with the mentality that Donald Trump will use and strengthening America.

I am sure that if I were a student in a foreign country on a visa I would be promptly booted out after I graduated. Why should we, the United States of America be so give mean when other countries don't give a crap about our livelihood.
