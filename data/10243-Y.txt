Rosa Duan I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. There are many students graduating from US universities in the STEM field. OPT extension not only give them a chance to deeply understand American company culture, but also let them contribute to booming the economy. 

2. Diversity is important to US. Many of those student became a bridge between US and other countries. They help people in their countries understand American culture and their way of doing business. There are even many CEOs of big international companies who studied in US, worked in US before they started their own business. Later, they came back and invested in US, creating jobs for American people.

3. Competition do exist between native Americans and international students. However, those students are not taking jobs from American people. Instead, they help keeping the American companies competitive in the global market. Because those students are equipped with good technology /science knowledge and are willing to apply what they have learned in school in practice.
