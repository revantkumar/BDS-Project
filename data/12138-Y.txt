I strongly supported the OPT extension program. This is just for STEM graduate students, who will find jobs in area that number of local students can not meet the huge requirement of industry. These areas include IT, engineering and science. Nowadays, tens of thousands of foreign students are working in OPT. Without OPT extension, it is highly possible that they must leave in one year after failing picked up by H1B, which can be a serious damage to US economy. Every year, millions of foreign students come to US to take education. They are smart, hardworking, can work in lower salaries and like to take jobs in STEM area that Americans do not like to do. We give them the best education in the world, and let them go back to make contribution to other countries. This is the most stupid and ridiculous policy I have ever seen.
