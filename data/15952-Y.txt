I support the OPT-extension propose for several important reasons:

First of all, many companies in US especially in area of science and technology hire international students. Without the contribution of these students, it is difficult for these companies to keep low cost and contribute to this country.

Second, international students in STEM field have essential knowledge and it is not easy to training them to this extent. If we reject them here, they will find positions in other countries and they can contribute to the growth to other countries. As a result, we train them for nothing. Finally we will lose talented individuals.

In summary, we should keep talented international students here by extend OPT for them to contribute to our economic growth.
