Currently in a STEM master program, I have heard from alumnae graduated from the same program express concerns that insufficient period of time would not allow for enough experiences and training to help them succeed at job positions. The cost of transitioning to another position in a diffenrt country would be extremely high and induce a waste of energy and input into current position. Please consider the talent and effort of all these international students who invested tremendous amount of time and money studting and doing apprenticeship in the US. Please help them succeed in thier career paths, not truncate them.
