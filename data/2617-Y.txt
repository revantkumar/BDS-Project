I'm glad to see that DHS is proposing a rule that benefits majority people in the US. The United States is a country built by diligent and progressive immigrants. For centuries people come to this new lands and work hard to make their families' life better and their community a nicer place to live. One can say there's no single great project in US history without the contribution of immigrants: Chinese labors in the construction of California railroad, European scientists in Manhattan Project, and numerous legendary enterprise including Google and Yahoo! founded or funded by first/second generation immigrants. It's safe to say that new immigrants have contributed to american society(which is mostly formed by old immigrants) both physically and spiritually.
Without doubt, studying in the US is a very import for new immigrants to come to the US and start their own legends. This rule, instead of pushing them out of the border along with their educated minds, will provide foreign students a great chance to get into the US society and make contributions. It offers they time to understand the US, found the next Google, Yahoo! and bring job opportunities, wealth and glories to all levels of the US society. 
This rule is a wise move and it has my fully support.
