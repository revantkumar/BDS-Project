I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Be helpful to decrees the unemployment rate. 
The proposal of improving and expanding training opportunities will bring development of other sideline productions, such as catering industry, tourist industry, bank industry and etc. Therefore, a lot of job position can be available. STEM students will not contest with us, without them, we were still struggling under the economic crisis. 

2. Improve US high-tech development.
We should rejuvenate the country through science and technology. However, the people in our country is not enough for the development of high-tech. We have to attract the talented people come to our country to help us. Besides that, A lot of projects are impossible to be finished in a short time. If the new proposal cannot be approved, we will face a huge loss.

3. Keep us away from economic crisis.
USA is a immigrant country. If we want sustainable development and keep the citizen away from economic crisis, we need to have appropriate policy to attract foreigns. Otherwise, the talented people will go to other countries.
