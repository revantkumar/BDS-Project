I STRONGLY AGREED with this proposal.

I have viewed some of the comments, within them most comments that opposed this proposal saying that the STEM OPT students would take over jobs from US citizens. As an international student, I think I have rights to leave a comment. 

During seeking jobs and internship, I used to asked a lot of companies about their hiring standards. Take Palantir for example, the hiring standard is as follows: First, they will filter out those interviewees lower than a HIRING BAR, and then give offers to those interviewees who are US CITIZENS and US PERMANENT RESIDENTS, then OPT/H1B workers. Another example comes from Workday, another IT company, as is known to me(since I had an internship there), for most of the positions, international students are not preferred, since they NEED H1B SPONSORSHIP. 

So according to this, those OPT students are not taking away jobs from US Citizens and US permanent residents, they have lower priority than permanent residents during jobs seeking. 

But what if International students are given chances to get longer STEM OPT extensions? Personally I think it will bring benefits to United States:

1. With such a 24 months extension, increasing excellent STEM students will be attracted to United States, thus improving U.S. academic standards in STEM, and benefitting US students respectively. 

2. Longer OPT extensions provide longer time for companies to examine the ability of international students. By such strict examination, the real talents can be selected as permanent residents, in this way they are able to help build United States, and create more job opportunities. That's just the target of immigration policies.

So, International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare for US citizens and PRs. Losing them, on the other hand, will benefit our competitors. Thus I strongly support this proposal to be passed.
