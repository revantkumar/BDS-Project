A decision is made by evaluating pros and cons, I'm supporting the OPT extension not just because of myself benefits but also the benefits for this great country- America.

Pros:
1. OPT policy is a huge attraction for talented and skillful people all over the world coming and working for America. And the competition among countries is basically competition of people. If America wants to keep the top position in the world, she has to keep the best talented people in the world.

2. OPT brings competition, which keeps local companies active and give people motivation to work. Not like European countries, America respect the creation of individuals and doesn't charge a high tax rate from the people who are building this country to pay the people who do nothing but earning the benefit from others tax. That's the encouragement for people to work, because there are competitions, and companies can get the real talented people working for them. People object OPT, and claim foreigners rob their job opportunities, a question rise in my mind: if two equally good people are competing one position, one is a foreigner, the other is an American, most companies will choose the American with no hesitate. Then why foreigners can rob the job opportunities? Because they are much better than these local people. 

Cons:

It's important to have citizens have jobs to do, OPT has a huge influence on job market. However, people will be benefit from competition, and the country will keep competitive by supporting OPT.
