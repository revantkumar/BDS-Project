I oppose using American citizens' money to put Americans out of work. Obviously the Department of Education needs the money from the bloated DHS budget more than corporate campaign donors, so use the money there instead. When the immigrant taxes us, it's not immigration, it's invasion. The Constitution is quite clear on invasion. Alienating Americans has no short term nor long term benefit. This is the proposal of tyranny, in defiance of any rational social contract a people could have with its government
