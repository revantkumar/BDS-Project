This proposal will greatly benefit the America in gaining help from the talents we trained and produced. Keeping the high skilled talents and potential immigrants in America helps us to maintain our competitive advantage. It's been proven how important these STEM international students are to our technology and science industry. I urge Department of Homeland to implement this proposal as soon as possible so that we can keep the best talents in the world in our own country rather than losing them out to other countries in the fast-paced 21st century globalization.
