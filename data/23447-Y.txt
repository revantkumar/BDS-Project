Nowadays there are more and more international STEM degree students. They are not only contributing to the GDP of the US but also contribute to the developing of the country. They are the smartest group of people that graduate from the school. We should definitely give them more opportunities and time to stay in the US and contribute more to the country. It will also be benefical to them in the future career. So I strongly recommend to improve and expand Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.
