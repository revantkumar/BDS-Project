I support the proposed STEM OPT extension. It will be really helpful to students in gaining valuable experience after they complete their studies. I think the proposed regulation should also take into consideration students who, after completing their STEM degrees, worked one year on OPT, and then instead of extending their STEM extension, went on to pursue another degree - STEM or non-STEM. For example, if someone has completed a Masters in Information Systems (a STEM degree), then worked one year on his/her OPT and, then instead of extending of going for STEM extension, enrolled in a Masters of Business Administration degree (another Masters degree but non-STEM). Such students will be able to mix their STEM as well as non-STEM knowledge in order to gain new skills and develop their leadership talent, an opportunity which is hard to gain otherwise. 
Thanks.
