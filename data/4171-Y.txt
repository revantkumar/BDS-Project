Good thing! As this may offer a lot of opportunities to the new-graduates to stabilize their jobs. Some people refuse to accept this as they blame that foreigners "rob" their jobs, but just think about the value of OPT holders:
1. They are highly educated and creating new stuff, and they are increasing tax incomes of USA not consuming the wealth of the society;
2. The ratio of criminals is much lower than the average, which is good for a healthy society;
As a Chinese, I will also claim that there are so limited OPT chances, comparing to many other countries. Definitely an unfair thing in such a society purchasing "equality"!
