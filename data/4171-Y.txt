Joshua H I strongly support this decision to extend the OPT for another 24 months. The American is an immigration country. The people who are citizens now, probably were immigrants in the last generations. As long as the international students can contribute to the economy development in US and pay tax, who care where they come from. Those citizens that who can't find a job should further train their skills. You can't never find a job, if you can't follow the development of our society. Don't complaint others! There are tons of jobs out there. The only problem is whether your are qualified for it.
