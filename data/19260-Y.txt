Currently the strict limitations placed on the employment eligibility conditions and durations for STEM students have greatly impacted the opportunities STEM students can get to make contributions to America. They usually face disproportionally large challenges even they are willing to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in use for the greater good. Such intellectual power is often wasted, and the wish of these young people to obtain better career training and to earn a better life through hard work is often denied, by the superfluous and unnecessary restrictions. America needs these scientists and engineers. I support extending the OPT duration.
