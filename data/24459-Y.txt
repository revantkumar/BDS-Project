I strongly support this rule.
1. High skilled international workers have made great contributions to US and especially the tech industry. Eliminating OPT extension would greatly hurt the tech industry.
2. International students with OPT extension are still at great disadvantage in job search compared to US citizens. Companies would have to pay extra to sponsor their visas if they want to continue to work, and there is always uncertainty with immigration law. Therefore, OPT extension would not hurt the job search for US citizens. Moreover, the hired international students need to be really good at what they do, and their work in US would greatly benefit US.
3. Eliminating OPT extension would make US a less enticing place for studying abroad. Therefore we need the rule to attract more international students to study in US.
