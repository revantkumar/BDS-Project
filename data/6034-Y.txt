I am not surprised that the most favorable comments come from foreign students. You have allowed them to come & learn at our expense. They are supposed to go home when their finished, but they see how we have allowed all of the other illegals to stay, so I'm sure that they don't believe that they will have to go home. You have allowed our citizens to be second class as you push these foreign students take over our jobs. Congress do the job that you have sworn to do & keep our people working.
