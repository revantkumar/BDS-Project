Ruiqi Yang I support the 24-month OPT extension for F-1 students. For STEM students, their work are mostly long term works such as researches or development, it may takes a long time, maybe one or several years. So if they cannot get the extension while they also fail to get H1B visa, their work would be broken and the institute they are belonged to would also experienced a loss because of their leaving. And the institutes and companies would have to hire new employers to continue the work which could increase the cost.
