Letting international STEM students stay will INCREASE and not decrease jobs. Companies ship the jobs to India, China and many other countries with lower pay if they cannot hire enough high quality workers in the US, or if the cost of hiring a US worker is too high. On top of this, international students create more jobs by starting companies. 

International STEM students will help improve American companies' ability of competition and not level down the salaries. They have become an essential part of American companies, especially technology companies.Rejecting international students would damage long-term benefit of American people because they will go back to their country and devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields create jobs for the country they serve for.

In a word, the positive impact international STEM students bring about is definitely far greater than the negative impact, so I strongly recommend this proposal!
