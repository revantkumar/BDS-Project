US has always been the first choice for us Chinese students when we think about going for school in another country. One of the greatest advantage for US college system is that it's more friendly to students when it comes to practical training. It's easier for us to find better job when we have experience working in US company and then go back China. 17 months less working time here would make a lot of difference in this process and this would make US much less attractive to Chinese students.

Take me for example, I spent around 150,000 dollars (Tuition and Life expenses) in the last two years as graduate student and I'm pretty sure I'm spending less than average Chinese students spend. I'm also sure that Chinese students consist a big portion of the international students that come to US. Tuition alone would make it worth it for US to keep its reputation about open-minded for international students.
