This is a great decision for international students as well as United states, because many of them are talented engineers and technical specialists. Cancelling OPT extension will cause enormous loss to both US tech companies and international students. On the other hand, with this extension, f1 students will have better opportunity to show their talents and make contributions to US tech growth. I will definitely support this decision.
