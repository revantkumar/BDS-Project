It is a common misconception that hi-tech companies have too many people applying for their positions and there is a competition between foreigners and American people. Actually, in today's America, the hi-tech industry is still fast growing. There are so many emerging hi-tech companies. They can not even get enough people to work there. IF they don't get foreign workers, they will lose their vibrant growing power. 
NOT to say that when it arises that an American is confronted with a foreign worker for a technical job, the foreigner is disadvantaged at large. 9 out of 10 for chances, the American worker will be chosen.
