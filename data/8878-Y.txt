Daisy Chow United States is a immigration country. All the international students contribute almost the same with other residences. We have the equal right to choose to work here or leave. We pay taxes and other fees, same as the Americans. Or sometimes, even worse. We contribute a lot but we don't get the same right with the Americans. If the immigration office continue to protect the Americans and prevent others to come in. Nobody will come to study here as they usually did. We don't want to study here because the tuition fees are so expensive and a lot of our classmates are more stupid than us. But THEY HAVE A BETTER JOB AFTERWARDS. That's terrible!
