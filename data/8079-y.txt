Steven Sun I believe this new rule has more benefit than harm to the U.S. with respect to job opening: 

On hearing about this new extension rule, one might worry about that more job positions will be taken by those STEM international students. It would be true by a simple math if we assume the job opening as a constant number in the future. However, this simple assumption is too naive and can not withstand the question of real economical rule. 

U.S. are losing advantages in a lot of industries, meanwhile U.S. are maintaining and even gaining more advantages in an decent amount of industries. As everyone know that, those industries with advantages are driven by Science and Technology. The key is advanced Tech/Science and the culture of respecting intelligence helped U.S. 

Maintain the fasted pace of tech iteration which had driven tens of millions of well paid job positions requires as much intelligent STEM educated workers as possible. The new rule will affect a few thousand new grads each year, giving a little more competitions to new grads with citizenship, yet the amount of job opening been affected is far less important than the new opportunities been created for industries for business for workers.
