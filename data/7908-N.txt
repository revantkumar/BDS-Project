There is no shortage of qualified IT workers. I am not sure where you get your facts. I have been in the industry for 20 years. The only thing I have seen happened, every time the enforcement or laws change to favor foreign workers the salaries go down, jobs become scarcer and the quality of IT workers goes down. Why at the time that tech companies are all laying off people and more and more Americans are having harder time finding jobs are you adding more immigrants to the job markets? I thought the administration's objective was to help the middle class. This goes well against the statements of our president and administration has made. Please do know allow this to become the law of the land. The foreign students are not the best and the brightest. They are from elite families that can afford to send their kids to universities in US at the expense of Americans. This is complete contradiction of our values and administration's stated values.
