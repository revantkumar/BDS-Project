I strongly support the proposal to expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees based on one main reason:

It will help America to obtain more innovation powers and thus keep leading in the world. 

Most of the stem foreign students are top talents from their own countries. Those talents can provide huge innovation in America if they have more time to work here.
