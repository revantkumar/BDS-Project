PLEASE GIVE THE OPT EXTENSION TO FOREIGN STUDENTS

I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is very important for the U.S., the success of US is based on bracing immigrants and foreign talents. Quite lots of eminent people now as a US citizen were actually international students.

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. I know there would be a great shortage of big data talents in the coming 10 years. However, most US citizens don't like majors like statistics, math which is quite pivotal to be a data scientist, thus the gap has to be filled by international students who are willing to work on such 'boring' subjects to stimulate US economy. 

3. Competition always exists, but it's not a bad thing. Lots of innovations were realized under the pressure of competition. As we can see, the US citizens who worked harder can get a pretty good job as well. Those who oppose this rule are the people who are not worked hard themselves but not due to the competition.
