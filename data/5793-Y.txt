From the prospective of research and academic institutions, this OPT 24 months extension should be supported. The success of academic institutions contribute to the US economy and culture in varies ways.
This extension proposal can attract more excellent international students, and bring benefits to the US for the following reasons:

1. The STEM students are the main work force in research. 
As a former researcher in a top university in mid-west, I can tell in the field of Science, Engineering and Technology, a majority of productive researchers are STEM international graduate students. Their solid knowledge, critical thinking, analysis skills, as well as the hard working attitude, contribute significantly to the academic prosperity. Their excellence is not a surprise because they are the top students from their own countries, hence much more productive than average local American students.

2. Our educational institutions need STEM students to help improve the education quality.
The STEM students are the main part of teaching assistants in universities. Without these STEM students, the schools may face much more difficulties than now, to conduct educational activities.

3. STEM students help to create great learning atmosphere.
Due the reason mentioned above, that they are from the top students in their own country, these STEM student help to form an environment that promote everyone to pursue knowledge, and work hard, which lays a positive foundation for the whole society in the long term.

In the end, the STEM students are great advantages for research and educational institutions. To retain them and to attract more of them to better benefit the US, the OPT extension play a crucial role.
