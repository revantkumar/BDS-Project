This would provide a great opportunity for international stem students, which is important to attract these students to our universities. And the reason we want these students to come to our universities is to get them to find jobs here and stay. Why would anyone not want intelligent, hardworking people to come here and fill jobs that the vast majority of US citizens aren't qualified for (or even interested in) anyways? An influx of intelligent scientific minds is a great way to improve the level of scientific intelligence in this country, which, frankly, is far lower than it should be.
