I feel that this ruling is fair and shouldn't be targeted by so many negative comments. It is sad to see how many Americans are posting their oppositions based on "excessive competition". America was built on a struggle for the better, and it reaches its success today because the previous generations of the Americans were never of afraid of competing. In fact, they worked their way up among the best in the world, befriended them, learned from them, and excelled on their unique ways. That's what made America the world leader it is today. Last time I checked, they called it the "American dream". Have you all forgotten how many foreigners were involved in the space program, the Manhattan program, and all the great leap forward in STEM achieved by this land that would not have been possible if she was not a country that embraced talents from everywhere? 

Driving away foreign students by restricting their opportunity to study and work among the Americans is a policy that will reduce America to just any other old country on Earth. It is basically to say close your eyes and and the world will pause for you. That's not American. America a land where openness leads to excellency. It deserve nothing less than that.
