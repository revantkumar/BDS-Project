Here is how I think of this extension. I am a graduate in Top university in U.S. , major in STEM and to be honest, most of my classmates are not U.S. Citizen. It seems like most of U.S. Citizen did not pay attention to ANY STEM major, because it need extremely hardworking and patience.

Some organizations in U.S. think it is people from other countries take their advantage and opportunity, but the truth is, the IT industry was supported by numerous people from other country. Look at how much CEO and CTO are from India ?! How many leading engineers are from China?! The probability to get H1B is low in recent years, if you do not offer any extension of OPT, these top mind will come back to their own country and build company and compete with you !!! I think who go against this extension regulation is short-sighted and stupid!! They care about offering opportunity for less competent citizen, but the bloody truth is that this industry is in a world wide competition, anyone lose talent will lose the game! If you do not let the talent stay, the talent will learn advanced technology in U.S. and go back to fight you back ! remember!
