I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is very important for the U.S., we can see a lot of scientist who are contributing this country were International students as well. This is a significant contribution and help to United States development, and this situation works since it started.

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition makes companies to select more talents, and as result, to makes both candidates and companies to improvement themselves. Foreign students know this competition and they realize they have visa issue during work, which makes them work harder no matter in schools or work.
