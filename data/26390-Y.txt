I strongly support the extension of OPT.

The U.S. technology industry has a strong need for hiring new graduate employees in science and technology field. Unfortunately, the small number of US citizens does not meet this need. Hiring international students is crucial to the success of high tech industry, which in turn powers the US economy.

The extension of OPT provides a chance for international students to contribute to the technology boom of the US. It is with significant meaning to both international students and US citizens.
