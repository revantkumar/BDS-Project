I think this extension to opt is fantastic! With more people competing for a position, companies will have chance to select the exact person that actually suits the job. people opposing to this program are afraid of competetion and owning their losing jobs to the foreigners rather than their own deficiency. Even if the company hires those person because of less competitors, they are not capable of making any contributions and profits to the company.
