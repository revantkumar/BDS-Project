Alice Maag OPT extension benefits not only foreign students but also US citizens from the long term perspective. Since competition is the first cause for evolution. It weeds out the weak, especially the laziness of human beings. It leads to self improvement. Driving those international students out may provide some positions for us citizens for a very short time. However, absorbing those smart and highly educated international students into the whole industry here will definitely lead to a positive competition mechanism and can create more job opportunities for all the people who is believe in American Dream and do their best to fight for it. History shows everything. Qing Dynasty of China, an really anti-foreign period leads to a tragedy which reduce the national power of China to a huge extent. So I strongly support OPT extension!
