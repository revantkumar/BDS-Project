I strongly support this proposal. America has been a great for being accommodating top talents from all over the world. America owes its scientific and technological contribution to international scholars and students. People come to the United States for its great educational system and resources towards researches and studies. In turn, it creates more opportunities for Americans in a long run. 

Conservatism does not make America a better country. Over-protectionism is not how a great country should adopt.
