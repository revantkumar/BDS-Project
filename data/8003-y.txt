Jing Ran To who it may concern,
This is Jing Ran, a recent graduate from University of Pennsylvania. I strongly SUPPORT the proposal to extend the OPT program to 24 months. As someone who experiences it first-handed, I believe such training is essential for students to gain experience after their study, and is an important factor for the United States to retain talents.

Short version:
1.When I was applying for colleges 4 years ago, I had a variety of options to choose from. As a top student in my class, I could have gone to the US, UK, Canada, Australia among many others. When I was job hunting last year, I was again facing a crossroad - US, Hong Kong, mainland China, Canada, UK... In both cases, I chose America because I believe in the opportunities and development here. I believe in this society as a decent and just environment that rewards virtue and merit. If America decides to throw these human capital like us out, I guess I was wrong and would have considered otherwise. 
2.I know that a lot of people understand H1B as tech companies' conspiracy to get cheap labor or consider high skill immigrants a threat to American jobs. This is, honestly, quite insulting. The truth is there are so many people like me - Ivy League or other top notched university educated and are willing to contribute to this country - who depend on H1B to stay here. We did not come here to be cheap labor.
3.We are not stealing jobs from Americans. Quite on the contrary, influx of high-quality human capital is what kept a country more competitive in the world market. This is true in Silicon Valley and is true everywhere else. Our contribution has made sure that America maintains leadership in many industries, and that means a more prosperous society and more jobs.
