As a H1b worker, I strongly support this ruling. I've seen many talented STEM OPT students in my professional life, they were smart and productive, they helped their companies solved many hard problems. However, as many of them were just graduated from school, they still need tons of experience to become great professionals. I'm sure this act will provide them the necessary time to hone their skills so that they can make even more contributions to their employers as well as America. I saw some oppositions in the comments arguing about that STEM OPT workers stealing the jobs of American workers by asking lower wages. I don't know what are all those arguments about because that is not the case that I have seen in the companies I've been work for. I work in the technology industry, computer science to be exact, I've talked to many HR's and engineers in many other companies, they mostly complains about not being able to hire quality employees, and some companies even spend few months before they can hire the right guy, if they do find the right guy, they ARE willing to pay enough to keep them, be the guy American or foreigners. So those people's arguments that STEM OPT students lower the wages and stealing American's jobs is definitely invalid if not wrong. Employers aren't that stupid to hire people who is willing to earn less because those people tend to be less competitive. Moreover, STEM OPT students are only a small friction of all the foreign students graduated from the college each year, remember that, this extension is only for students who study SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING and MATH, think about that, how many great innovations have came out of these fields over the past few decades. America is built by people from all over the world, so don't keep those driven, talented and innovative people outside of the door.
