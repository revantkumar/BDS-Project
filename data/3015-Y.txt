Hi Alan,

Our government is not putting foreigners over citizens. First of all, international students pay much more expensive tuition which can be used to support American students who need financial aid. Second, their employment is highly restricted. They are not allowed to take any off-campus jobs or work-study jobs. All these are only available to American students. Second, in the job market, the visa sponsorship takes a lot of money, making most employers reluctant to hire international students. As a result, only the greatest and brightest of them can get jobs here. America is a country of immigrants. Illegal immigration is bad, but letting the real good people in legally is what makes this country strong and economically developed, so this proposed rule will make America greater in the long run.

Warmest regards,
