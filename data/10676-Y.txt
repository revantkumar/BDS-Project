I strongly support this effort. While our government is busy providing amnesty to illegal aliens, this is where are immigration system should be fixed. I believe most educated and sane people in this country would agree to the contribution of these STEM workers, though short term. 
Anyone who complains about it is ill informed or not qualified enough for regular STEM jobs. Please be aware that letting go these workers is not going to increase your qualifications, the companies will just hire these individuals at foreign locations.
