I strongly agree with OPT extension for several reasons.

First of all, diversity is important not only to academic programs but also for companies. Nowadays, international students already get limits from companies which do not sponsor h1-b. OPT enables them to gain opportunities to work in US, which is potentially benefit to both companies and students because several companies need international students for their global market or product development. 

Additionally, one of attractions for academic programs provided by universities in U.S is that international students can gain work experience in U.S after graduation and that is a great advantage for them to find a better job later in their home countries. If OPT is cancelled, it will heavily influence the academic program admission and further lead to issues in university education diversity. 

Also, most of projects in companies are 2-3 year long, it is totally reasonable to extend the opt to 24 months, which is good for company product and project development.
