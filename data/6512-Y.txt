Bob Don I strongly believe that F1 STEM OPT-Extension will greatly benefit US. 
This policy will provide the universities in US with best students in the world because it will serve as an incomparable advantage over other education systems. Most international students come to study in US because it provides sufficient opportunities for us to gain practical working experience in industry. That's why when planing study abroad almost all top students consider universities in USA as their best choices. Take me as an example, as a student who were born in China, if it were OPT-Extension for STEM students, I may not choose to study in USA because I don't want to stay too far away from my families and spend the high costs on education.
Secondly, it significantly stimulates the local economy. Usually when I worked, I spent more than 400 dollar per month for rental. 200 dollars for food, clothes and transportation. All these contribute a lot for local economy.
