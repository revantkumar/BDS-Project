In agriculture companies, training of new graduate employees usually takes 1 to 2 years; Companies prefer to apply for H1B for these employees after one-year running in period, and they want to keep the employee after they do so. Given the increasing H1B applicants and lower H1B lottery rate, a longer OPT period, which provide 1 more H1B application opportunity, will be beneficial to both companies and F-1 visa students/employees: companies don't need to rush to decisions and the students/employees get their opportunities to learn and work.
