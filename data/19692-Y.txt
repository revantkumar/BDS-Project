How ridiculous people are so shortsighted. OPT employees are actually boosting the American STEM business and creating jobs in these areas in the long term. American companies are hiring foreign students because their skills help them develop. The STEM industries still need more and more American workers, because they are expanding! Only the whole industries continues to prosper, can the economy grow and thus more jobs created. That is why countries like China are dying to attract their students coming back. To most foreign students, OPT is just a part of their education, they returned to their countries and possibly getting better paid jobs after gaining some working experience here. Those who eventually stayed in the US are just real talented and needed by American employers. Don't forget stopping OPT will lessen the attractiveness of US universities and hurt the education systems! If American STEM students are busy keeping foreign talents away rather than sharpening their own skills, US technologies and education will be outrun by other countries and you are waiting for the day that everything is not only made in China but also patented by China!
