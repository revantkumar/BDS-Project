I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:
1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.. 
2. As the strongest country in the world, diversity is very important to keep American 
No.1 position. That's why so many international students want to go to America.That's why America can be the strongest country in the world. American Dream is the most important point to attract the smartest people all of the world.
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Without competition, company will slowly lose its market, country will lose his position in the world. Lots of students don't take low salary, however they take a very high salary because the company can't find the proper people among native students, like GOOGLE, ORACLE, FACEBOOK. Competition will help increase the average technical level in america, no matter native students or international students, they will work harder and learn more. This will make America more competitive in the world.
4. We still pay lots of tax for American society and however still have lots of restriction compared with native students. The new proposal will give us more chance to get H1 visa due to the huge number of people applying for that.

Don't forget. Why people want to come to America and stay here. Why America is the strongest country in the world. If lots of students must leave due to the failure of the proposal, America will slowly lose his power in the world and replaced by other country. I think every American don't want that happens. In the future, when looking back you should know this proposal got approved is the right way you make America stronger.
