I really liked your training and mentorship program, but there are still scams happening in USA on jobs by desi consultancies while they put fake experience to get graduate job it is effecting other graduate who is sincerely trying for job whithout any expereince because even that 5-10yr fake experience guy is getting paid as a graduate(who may be a US citizen or a immigrant), and that's the reason why your citizens who are giving a best are not even considered beacause of this faking which a big loss for both citizens and immigrants,this is not a concern of just one student they 1000's of people who are facing this problem. if your government is really intrested to clean this shit please go to any desi indian consultancy as a student I repeat go as a "student" tell them i am ready to pay the amount of what they ask which they tell you it for "training" and further you will get to know what's really happening !!! there are 1000's of this kind of shit consultancies all over US. yes you heard the number right! it means you still have to uncover so much of this big scams on jobs please show us a way to which is more clear for us to search for jobs, we have already 1000's of dollars here I would more than feel cheated if your government can't handle this issue.
