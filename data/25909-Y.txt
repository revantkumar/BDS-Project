Thank you for clarifying on this rule! This will help America become a knowledge superpower and hold its competitive advantage in the long run. One request would be to consider the possibility of extending this by five more months so that students like me who graduate in December can get one more chance to apply for H1 and utlize the cap gap extension.Thanks again!
