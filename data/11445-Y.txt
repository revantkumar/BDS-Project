I quite agree about extending the OPT to 29 months.Because most of the international students who study STEM are probably the most intelligent people in their own countries.And they have to work much harder than local people to find H1B support and maintain their legal immigration status.They can work to support themselves so they won't occupy the public charge from this society.They can contribute a lot to this country's GDP.Also most of them are well-educated they have less chance to be a criminal person.Why not give these intelligent people more time to find their chance to realize their American dream?As we all know,the first group of people who establish America are people immigrant from other countries.Why stop good people from moving in just because they come a hundred years later?
