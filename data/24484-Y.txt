This is an exciting news for US! I strongly SUPPORT the proposal on the behalf of an academic researcher:

As more F1 students join the research, more projects are contributed by the intelligent and hard-working F1 students. Most of the projects, specially the valuable ones, could not been done in a short time. Expanding the time DEFINITELY gives the researchers a wonderful opportunity to maintain and continue the research production.

Otherwise, the F1 students have to worry about market from an early time, which trims their time spend on the research and project. 
Same thing even after the F1 students graduate. If they have to come back home, it's extreme hard to maintain and continue the research and project.

US government knows how to use international intelligence by holding open immigration policies to attract talented international people. In the days that the whole world is developing so fast, this proposal is an effective way to strengthen US.
