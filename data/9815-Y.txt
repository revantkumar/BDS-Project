I certainly support this proposal and think it would be a big step for the "American Dream" to come true. As we all know, the United States of America is an immigration country from its origin and it cannot become such a wonderful and powerful country in the world without the contributions and innovations that immigration brought from all over the world. It would never be enough to stop talents and high skilled immigration from working and living in America to contribute themselves to the country, unless we don't want our country to become better and more prosperous. They are the wealth to America and we need to give them more opportunities to help make their dreams come true. 

And I don't think this proposal would harm citizens on finding jobs in STEM programs. In contrast, I do think this would even do a great help to make related industries become more bigger and better, which would create more job opportunities and enhance the development of the whole industry. 

Why be afraid of the competition from those students? This world is full of competitions, hence it would even make us better and stronger, they would get together with us to make America a wonderful and powerful country in the world!
