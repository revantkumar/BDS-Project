Strong support! I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. On one side, US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.If we let the tremendous amount of skill-equipped human resources outflow from the U.S only because of weak competitive power of our citizens., then it will be an unestimated loss to our domestic companies and to the country as a whole. If our domestic companies are no longer able to compete with foreign companies hiring more talented workers who once studied in our country and eventually lose global market share, then our domestic industries will be severely impacted and unemployment rate of citizens will go even higher.
