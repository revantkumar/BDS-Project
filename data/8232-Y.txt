Hao Deng To whom it may concern,

As we all noticed, the STEM program has provided numerous talent students as candidates for US job market, and then become indispensable for many tech companies.

Most common US people cannot distinguish H1B and OPT. H1B is the working visa and OPT is the time of a student can work. 

For now, most students can have only one year OPT, which makes it very hard for non-STEM student to find a full-time job given the fact that there are so many applicants for H1B visa due to chances and cost issues. 

Therefore, STEM program is devised to increase the chance of employment for students who are good at math, engineering, computer science, etc and at the same time, make sure US companies can get enough staff they need for development. It is somehow unfair for international students who are not in STEM program but it is for the benefit of US, not internationals because US is not lack of business, marketing and non-STEM students.

Some people may claim that the consequence of cancelling OPT extension is the increase employment rate for US workers. But from my perspective, the most likely consequence is that tech companies or research institutes cannot find enough qualified workers with good skills. As we all know, technical skills are able to be quantified and measured and it means that training workers such as programmers requires time and education. If OPT extension is cancelled, most STEM students will choose to go back to their hometown, for example China, rather than wasting time in US for an internship. 

From a policy maker perspective, I will say there will be an short-term impact for employment rate temporarily. However, it will be a great loss for long-term economic development and if these companies fail, we can predict thousands of jobs lost.

Thanks
Hao
