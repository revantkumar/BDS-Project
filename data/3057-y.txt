Jiawei Lin As a new graduate who has worked for a U.S. company for almost half a year, I support the proposed rule that improving and expanding OPT for STEM F-1 students. This rule will not only benefit us, but also benefit the American employers and improve economy of the States. 

I got both my bachelor's and master's degrees in a top engineering college in States. Back in school,
there were more than 1/2 students from outside of States in my Master's classes. This is because not that many Americans would choose to continue their education right after graduating from undergraduate school especially in engineering or science area. This ratio also works after graduation. Tons of International students are currently working for their companies in relative fields. True, we paid high tuition to come all the way here, far from home, are for some good work experiences for a few years. But the more important thing is that America needs us. The schools need us and the employers need us. Many new technologies nowadays were created together by people from worldwide. This OPT extension rule will keep attracting International students to come to the States to get great education and also will keep providing work force to the high technology industry, and consequently, keep improving the economy of the States and technological innovation.
