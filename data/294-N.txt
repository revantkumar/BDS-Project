This sort of non-sense needs to stop! Instead of our Government protecting its Citizens like other Governments protect theirs, Our US Government is nothing but a bunch of "Whores" who sell-out to the highest bidder! "Americans First" is what Capitol Hill needs to be reminding itself! Even though I was a professional pilot, I've seen my job and other flying jobs go to non US Citizens, while these other countries REFUSED to even consider allowing me to work there! If this can't be a "two-way-street", then it shouldn't be allowed at all!! The true unemployment rate in the US is closer to 30-35%! With that in mind, employ Americans first! After all WE ARE THE ONES WHO VOTE, WE ARE THE ONES WHO PAY YOUR SALARY AND WE ARE THE ONES YOU WORK FOR!!!!
