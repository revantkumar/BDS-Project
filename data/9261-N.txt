Foreign students agree to leave after receiving their degree. Letting them stay at all much less increasing the amount of time they are allowed to stay is violating that agreement. Giving companies the opportunity to hire a foreign student with breaks for the company in lower wages and taxes not required to be paid gives them an unfair advantage over our own citizens. There is not a national emergency because of a lack of STEM workers or lower paid workers. There are instead greedy companies who wish to hire people at lower than minimum wage and a tax break for them. There are too many out of work Americans for this to be anything but a very bad idea.
