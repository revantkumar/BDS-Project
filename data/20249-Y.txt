We are highly concerned that you will be favoring foreign workers with a STEM background over American youth that are committed to a STEM education and have been recruited into highly acclaimed STEM schools. For instance, we have a grandson who dedicated himself in middle school to begin taking AP classes so as to gain access to a STEM high school by appointment. He succeeded in being accepted, one of only 100 to be accepted, to a highly acclaimed STEM high school in Seattle, WA. He has now been accepted into university this year after his high school graduation and will be studying computing engineering.

With these proposed regulations, it tells us you will be putting foreign STEM students ahead of our American youth in being accepted for employment by the government use of monetary incentives to employers. How very disappointing is that to our own youth, by our own government discouraging their employment by giving favoritism to foreign nationals! 

We plead with you to do what is right for our own first and change this proposal or delete it entirely!

Sincerely,

Ron & June Secreto
