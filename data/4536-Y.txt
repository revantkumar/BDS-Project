The new OPT extension will help US tremendously. Twenty years ago, best college students in China came to the US for graduate school and most of them stayed. They later on became prestigious university professors and made tremendous contributions to US scientific community. Nowadays the number of Chinese students who stayed after PhD program has declined significantly. The first reason is China has initiated many programs to encourage Chinese students to go back with generous support. The second reason is that many students in US who have obtained PhD degrees have problems to maintain eligible status, which is very absurd. US has been the greatest country in the world because it attracts the most talented people from all the world. With shortened OPT period, US will push these talented people back to their own country and from the long run will harm the US's leading role in the world.
