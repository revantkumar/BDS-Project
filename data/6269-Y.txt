I support this rule to extend the OPT STEM period for all eligible F-1 students. It gives students a chance to continue and explore job opportunities in the STEM sector. There are a lot of jobs available for STEM students, but there is a severe lack of skills and talent. If foreign students are granted the authorization to work in this sector, it will help fill the thousands of job positions.
