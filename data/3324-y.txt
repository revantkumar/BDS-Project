Robert Cooke I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. This rule let foreign students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Foreign students with OPT will not take up work opportunities for Americans because US Citizen and Green Card Holders have higher privileges by employers over foreign students. Employers hire more foreign students because they can not hire enough Americans. Competition would improve everyone's capabilities and make Americans more competitive all over the world.
