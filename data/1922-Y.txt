I suggest that we should keep the expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students because it benefits both the US and the rest of other countries. For the US, the stem majors are certainly attracting more and more foreign students coming to the US to study, and in the same time, paying the huge amount of tuition fees each year. If there were no more stem majors, it is certain that coming to the US for further study will not be their first choice. Besides, those students who can find employment after graduation are the smartest and best ones from the crowd. It is a good thing that these students can stay at US for a little longer and they surely will add value to the US companies. For the students, it is good if they have longer OPT so that they will be able to gain more experience of the advanced technology and methodology in the US.
