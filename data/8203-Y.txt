I maintain the idea that opt extension will help both students and the country. Following two reasons will illustrate my thoughts.

In the first place, opt extension makes difference for education. International students are not only seeking for advanced education but also industry experience in the U.S. Other countries like Canada already release such kind of regulation to help international students gain valuable work experience. If students can't get what they want here they will turn to other places and therefore the country will lose a great deal of talented international students.

In addition, there would not be any side effect for American students. International students meet a lot of restrictions in terms of nationality when finding jobs. And they have to pass several difficult interviews to get a job since jobs for foreign students can never be as many as those for native students, which also ensure the equality mostly.
