Xuan Huang It is not that OPT actually increase the probability for foreigners to be hired. Under equal circumstances of course domestic applicants will be considered first.

Aparently going through all those visa and document works will not be something to be welcomed by any employers. Problems in language the same. In fact, a foreigner can take only position that is proved to have no qualified American applicant, so that OPT is not able to steal working chances from domestic graduates.

Instead, companies benefit from people of various backgrounds and solid academic knowledge (by which they get the job with even all the strict requirement for foreign employees), so do their workmates. 

I cant see OPT gives any threat to Americans working competitiveness in their own country, except that it arises their awareness that there are other groups of people working hard as well on their on paths. The extension certainly provide valuable experience, for both foreigner who wish to gain more experience after their study here, and Americans in a society of open, cooperative environment.

On the other hand, the failure of OPT extension may somehow send a discouraging (unfriendly maybe?) message for the potiential foreign students who wish to go to college in the US. As far as for some people I know it already is, after hearing some negetive comments about the policy.
