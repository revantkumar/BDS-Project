Daryl Baker I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT policy. 

OPT students are making huge contributions to our country, especially in technology field. Many big name IT companies rely a lot on them. And such companies play a big role in our country's economic growth. In other world, international students' salary tax is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. It is good for U.S. citizens. With these international students' contribution, we could improve the welfare of American people.
