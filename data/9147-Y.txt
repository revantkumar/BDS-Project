Brianna Cj I strongly support this proposal not only because it will help growing the economics in United States but also because it will increase the diversity, thus people all over the world will contribute to United States and that is part of the reason U.S has the most advanced technology among the world! Without this policy, more and more intelligent people have to go back and so do their creative ideas and hard work.
From these points of view. I strongly support this proposal and hope it could be approved!
