Julian Parsons Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.
