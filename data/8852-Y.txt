I strongly agree with this proposal.

I'm not going to talk about the money international students throwing on education. I would like to say something about job opportunities. 

When an international student graduates from a US college, all he or she understands is how an American college works. After one years training and familiarization with his or her internship company, he / she knows the daily life and the basic rules of an American company. But after a three years term, by which someone could experience a completed procedure to build and to finish a project, the person has gained a thorough knowledge of how an American company treats its product and its customers. Those well-experienced young professionals, unlike freshly graduated students, are extremely welcomed in most of the foreign companies. After returning to their own country, they are more likely to get a quick promotion, and participate in their companies' management and decision soon.

We all know that US is doing business all around the world. Those Americanized "decision makers" are the best advertisement for US industry. Their career lives are initialized in a truly American way. They share the understanding of business with US company runners. There is already an international network established.

I agree that US young people deserve more "good pay" jobs. But you can definitely get more job opportunities by creating them, rather than reserving them. I am very confident, that fully trained international students will bring US companies more chances, and therefore more money, and certainly more potential job opportunities.
