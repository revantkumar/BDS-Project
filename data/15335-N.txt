Other countries -especially those who have a high rate of unemployment as we do - almost 93 MILLION AMERICANS WHO ARE WITHOUT A JOB - have to prove that they tried to hire Americans first (by putting ads in, etc.) before they are "allowed" to hire foreigners! Sounds like something we should do: call your State Legislators and tell them if you want this!
