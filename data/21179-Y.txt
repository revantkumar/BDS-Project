It's a great opportunity for US, this can make more talented people working in US for a longer time, some opt holders are really more suitable for the position than others, they just graduated from college which means well educated, and they have more motivation than natives, because they must work harder to keep their positions especially not in their mother town.
It's a great move to extent the OPT to 24 months, the opt holder can have 2 or 3 times to get their H1B visa done.
Great moves!
