KOUSHIKREDDY CHAGANTI I strongly support this rule because it gives international students an opening to expand their knowledge in their respective fields with the chance it provides international students to work and gain exposure directly working with the American companies. we are very thankful to the USA for giving us a chance to pursue our master's, it would be a great chance if we had an opening to directly apply the knowledge we gained by serving the American companies, which would be a great breakthrough in molding one's future career.
