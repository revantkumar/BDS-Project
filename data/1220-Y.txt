OPT STEM program is legitimate and should stay. It is not the reason for unemployment of U.S. citizens because there are same increasing percentage of international students among all graduating students every year looking for jobs. OPT STEM program only makes the number of international students participating in the drawing every year larger, but the limitation of number of H1B each year is the critical factor. Also,the program only benefits small amounts of people, and I would say they are the people doing real and meaningful things in technological and scientific fields. They deserve to have a chance to compete with U.S. citizens. Having a STEM program means that they got a second shot.This is a case of majority against minority, and I really hope that the government and U.S. court can make the right decision to protect the benefits of minorities.
