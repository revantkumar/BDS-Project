I SUPPORT this new rule. 

As an international student, I felt a little frustrated when reading those comments saying we are taking American citizens job. WERE NOT! When I go to career fair and try to talk to companies representatives, I always hear Sorry, we only hire American citizens. I feel a little sad when hearing this response, but meantime, I totally understand and think it makes sense. Because we are in the US, it serves its people first, even though only fewer company will receive our resumes and this is even true for unpaid internship. 

However, when I see so many people are against us, I wonder why Americans start to act so unfriendly. I always think USA is a diversified and friendly land. This is why I come here for further education and also suggest my friends come regardless of the heavy tuition fee. It is three time of that for Hong Kong University and Tokyo University. I hope that this rule will pass finally, this will be a good sign that USA is still a welcome country to all students and prospective students. Therefore, when asking about the life there, I will continue saying it is totally worth and will not leave a regret.
