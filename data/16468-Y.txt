The 24 months OPT extension is reasonable and should be passed.

I am an opt student who works as a software engineer in America. Good software usually takes years to be built and one year just let the engineer start familiar with the whole project. My company gave me around 3 month to familiar the whole project before I start to code something. In that case, Software Company won't want to waste so long time on an engineer who can just work for one year. 

Give these students more time to work in the company and contribute more to this country.

We call this optional practical training (OPT) so let's make it really practical.
