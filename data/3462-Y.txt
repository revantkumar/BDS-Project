I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule.

When I came to a point to decide which country to continue my master degree two years ago, I chose USA, mainly because there are more opportunities for students like me has a chance to gain working experience, which means a lot for students who pay the extremely high tuition but don't even have more chances to sharp their skills from university.

The rule not only benefits foreign students, but also has a great impact of the reputation of USA university, which keep attracting more talented people to country. If you ask me, what makes USA stronger and attractive than the other countries, this is the reason, TECHNOLOGY.

Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) related industries like manufacturing, finance, professional services, and trading are great contributors (around 55%) to the US GDP (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2014 data) . Needless to say the comparative advantage in STEM human resources help the US to maintain its world leading position. Not only do the industries that are related with STEM, but also the maintaining the US leading position in the world require a lot of hard working employees and researchers. Highly educated immigrants are great work force while few/ A few citizens are willing to do those tedious works with medium payment. Extending F1 students' serving time will benefit these major GDP driver areas.
