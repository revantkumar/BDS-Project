I am currently a Chinese student who now studies at Penn State University, University Park. I strongly support for the proposal. The US is a country that respect the equality, freedom and ability. I have a good grade with my major, I always enjoy my college life with my friends. It is very unfair for those who treat the international students like the locusts who taken the local American jobs! We are here because of the great reputation of education and the great spirit of working, competing in the field of business!! There is no good thing for either native Americans or international students to oppose the proposal!
