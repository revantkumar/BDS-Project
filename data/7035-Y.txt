Of course I strongly support the rule. For those U.S. citizens think that jobs offered to STEM students will take away opportunities from them. I want to point out that close the door is never a good way for a country's development. Positive competition and exchange is the correct way for a country's development! I come from China, one century ago, China was very poor and weak just because the government at that time close the door to the world and thus fall behind in the many aspects. 
We are in the 21st century! We can not stop the trend of globalization! This rule is smart to attract millions of talented students all over the world and contribute their skills to the development of the United States! We also pay taxes to this country to improve the well being of the whole society. All of the US citizens can benefit from this and can get more jobs from the growth of overseas education industry.
