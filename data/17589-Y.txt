As an owner and CEO of a start-up high-tech company in Bay area, I strongly agree to this OPT extension decision. Nearly half of the employees in my company are using OPT. They are talented and hard working. However, it is very hard for them to obtain the H1B visa through the lottery. If this decision is approved, they can continue work for me and create a breakthrough project which may change everyone's life style. Otherwise, without these highly skilled international employees, i have to give up my business. That's a great lose for me, for my family and for every people in the United States. In my experience, these international students work harder than american students, and they are more productive than US workers. That's why I prefer to hiring those hard working and highly skilled employees.
