Mir Shams Being able to work for a company in the US for a longer period of time not only benefits the employee but also is beneficial for the company itself. If the STEM extension period is extended by 24 months then the foreign employee will have total 3 years of experience with a company and eventually can become valuable enough to contribute to national economy. I personally appreciate the proposal to extend the STEM extension by 24 months and looking forward to this rule be in effect soon.
