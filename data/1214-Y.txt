I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
Some American citizen think international students took their job, that's untrue.
Companies hire people based on their skills, international students work hard, that's how they get jobs. Also, stem students are just very small part of international students, they are making huge value to the country, that's why the proposal would have way more benefit and it's very reasonable.
