Sophie Li The new STEM OPT extension proposal is not only good for international students but also great for the company that hired these international students. According to the current STEM OPT policy, not every international students can get their H1B to continue working in the US within the 17 months extension period, which means they have to leave after graduated for 12 months or 29 months. Leaving a company after working for just a short time destroyed the international employee's career plan. Also it is a great losses for the company. My friend's company has to hire new employees every year just because of their previous employees have to leave for failure in applying for their H1B. With this new STEM OPT extension proposal, this problem could be mitigating. This new extension proposal could provide plenty of time for newly graduated international students to find a job. And the new employees can work in a company for a longer time.
