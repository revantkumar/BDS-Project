For this rule, I want to say it's DEFINITELY a win-win deal. 

1. For any significant project, it takes more than several months to make a meaningful contribution and deeper understanding. If international student don't have this time, students are more focusing on short benefit. Eventually, it will hurt long time growth. 

2. Also, OPT extension is really a good way to attract students from different countries to study in America. Right now, more and more countries provide this way to attract talented person. If government cancels this policy, America will experience a severe talent loss.

3. Third point, international student take direct benefit to local economics. International students pay more than 30% tuition fee than residence. University, institution use this fee to purchase new devices, build new building and put in scientific project. 

4. Everify program is just a rule to protect international students from discrimination!!!!!!
