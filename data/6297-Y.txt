Govinda Bachani OPT Extension benefits the employers and US in a wider perspective, if we think about it. The US economy is dependent a lot on the revenue generated by University providing opportunity to international students to pursue degrees in the STEM field. If this rule is not implemented, the future students might not be inspired to join US universities which could be disaster in itself. 

As for considering loss of Job opportunities for American Citizens, I attend school at a reputed university in the Massachusetts and I can confidently say that there are not more than 15-20 American Citizens (in a class of more than 200) pursuing masters program. This in itself shows the lack of enthusiasm in American Citizens to pursue higher degrees in STEM field. A lot of organization prefer master candidates or they want people who have a years of professional experience for job opportunities. and if we consider sub par payment to immigrant workers, that's not the case. The organization put a lot of effort in hiring and the compensation offered to international student is at par with their american counterparts in most of the case. 

Though I acknowledge the fact a lot of staffing companies misuse the STEM Extension program to hire cheap labor in form of immigrant workers. I want that such companies should be brought to notice which misuse the law and strict action should be taken against them.

So all in all I can say the DHS has taken an excellent step to propose this new rule and a lot of people are going to benefit by this rule.

Thanks
Govinda
