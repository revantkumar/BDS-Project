Eason Sun I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because it is good for every side that involved in.

For the international STEM students it will not only provide more chances and experience of getting involved into truely advanced science and technology but also more chances to contribute to the project here. Thus it will improve the international students' ability and chance to find a job all over the world.

The proposal will also bring advantage to American universities. More and more country are providing more chances for the international students because international students will not only pay for the tuition, but also increase the effect of universities.

Besides, since now more and more American natives tend to learn law and business, the proposal help the American companies to get more skilled workers that satify the development need instead of being restricted by the lack of workers.

To sum up, the proposal from DHS will definitely bring the advantage to the all sides that involved in.
