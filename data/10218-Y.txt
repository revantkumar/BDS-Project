I strongly support this regulation of STEM extension. Since many high tech companies (e.g. IT companies in Silicone Valley) in the United States need a large number of talents and they hire large numbers of well-trained international students. They work hard to contribute to the revenue of the companies, as well as tax and GDP. Such companies could find enough U.S. citizens to satisfy their needs so that they have to hire international students. If OPT lasts for only one year, qualified international graduates won't be attracted to work for those companies easily and local economic will be slowed down.
