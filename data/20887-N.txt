The American people need to address the problem of a lack of opportunity for its own people first. We are not the worlds sugar daddy. This lack of opportunity is a direct result of the social engineering that has its roots originating in an elite class created by those only interested in personal gain and control (subjugation) of the American people.
Bringing in those who have no intention of benefiting this country and are only interested in personal gain and the furthering of a nefarious agenda is self defeating.
