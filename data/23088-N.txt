I oppose and protest the Optional Practical Training program that the Department of Homeland Security's is proposing. Why is it any of DHS's business anyway. It sounds like a back handed way for the Democratic Socialist party to bring America to it's knees by taking away jobs from US citizens. 

To bad our current government has so may traitors to our country. This kind of treachery is what is going to either break or bring about an angry ground swell of Americans who are tired of being treated like this.
