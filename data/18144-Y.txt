First of all, I would like to thank government officials in DHS could generate this new proposal in such a short time window.

This new enhanced proposal is bringing benefits in many ways for both students who are in STEM degrees and their potential employers. 

For example, per 80 FR 63387 in the proposed rule, a customized training plan brings multiple benefits:

1. This give students ability to discuss with their employers the training details regarding what they would learn from their training, thus provide them a fair understanding of all the pros and cons when comparing internship offers.

2. Greatly enhanced security aspect to the 2008 rule, by proposing mandatory training plan, letting school DSO and potential training employers to work more closely with each other could address the concerns that some ill intent individuals would provide fake documentations from non-existent employers and let them stay in the country illegally.
