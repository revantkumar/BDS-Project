Tianwu Zang I fully support this OPT extension program because diversity is the core value of the USA and STEM professionals are priceless fortunes to this nation. 
During WWII, lots of scientists and engineers came from European to America and made tremendous contributions to the Manhattan project. After the cold war, numerous scientists from the USSR came to America and helped a lot in the development of science & technology in the United States. In the past decades, tens of thousands of elite students in STEM major came from all corners of the world to study in America and worked in this country after graduation. Their talent and hardworking characteristics are one of the most important reasons why the United States keeps being the world leader in science and technology. It cannot be imagined what the USA would be today without countless contributions of these international students. Ignoring the importance of international education programs and reducing the working opportunities of international students are definitely anti-intellectual, which will cause a lot of harms to the future of the United States.
