I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I believe the current OPT policy is one of the reasons why the U.S. education sector is regarded as one of the best globally. It makes U.S. institutions popular destinations for international students to pursue tertiary education. Attracting foreign students not only helps U.S. institutions financially, but also provides U.S. students a more diverse educational experience and learn from their foreign counterparts. Countries such as Canada, New Zealand and Singapore are actively trying to attract overseas students, there is no reason why U.S. should be left behind. 

This new rule also helps U.S. companies, especially those which would want to expand their reach beyond the U.S. borders. With the OPT extension rule, companies may recruit international students and benefit from them both in terms of their technical skills they contribute as well as these foreign talents' knowledge of their home countries. 

Hence, I believe this new OPT extension rule is extremely beneficial to the U.S. and thus should be approved.
