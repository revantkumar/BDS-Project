The Federal Government should bias hiring towards US citizens. If foreigns are to be hired, it should be done only after all US citizen applicants have been determined to lack the necessary minimum requirements for the job.

The United States is currently in one of the worst employment recessions in history. To actively seek foreigners for employment while so many citizens are searching for work is illogical.

The proposal is bad, and as a US tax payer, I request that it not be employed.
