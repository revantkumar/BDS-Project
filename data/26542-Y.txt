I support the 24-month STEM OPT extension and the increased flexibility given to F-1 students to have additional extensions after higher STEM OPT degrees. F-1 students contribute to our economy immensely. As an immigration attorney helping startup founders, talent, and investors in Silicon Valley, I see everyday how brilliant foreign students strive to stay in the US to pursue their dreams, dreams which would dramatically contribute to the US economy. Please put this rule into effect.

There are two major challenges that I see. The first is that the DSOs will be completely overwhelmed with the increased reporting requirements. My experience from talking to clients is that it is already very difficult for the students to reach the DSOs for help. Also, the rule must go into effect before the February 2012 vacatur takes effect or else the government must find a way for these current students to maintain their status.
