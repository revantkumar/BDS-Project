I support DHS on this proposal. 
Without immigration reform to help remove barriers that prevent some students from studying in the U.S. or remaining here after they finish their degrees, the U.S. is missing out on enormous benefits. We must find a way to make the United States a more welcoming nation, a value upon which this country was founded. If foreign students are not provided amicable environment, the billions of dollars they contribute to this nation, along with the invaluable academic and cultural contributions they bring, will be at risk.
