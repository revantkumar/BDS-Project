I strongly support this rule. Nearly every US high-tech companies are hiring these F-1 student who have higher degree. It is no doubt that these high-tech companies are the core engine of US economy and US competitiveness to the other countries. Without these graduated student with OPT visa, you can not go shopping on Amazon. Without them, you can not get the results you want from google. Without them, you will definitely and only use iphone 6s for ever, but not iphone 7,8,9...Without them, who can help us develop the next generation high-tech products? All in all, without these hard working international employees, everyone in the US will live worse and worse. No internet, no smart phone, no online shopping, nothing. Is it still that powerful and freedom United States? Of course not. We can not lose. That's why we have to keep those international employees with higher degree and high technology skills. We need them.
