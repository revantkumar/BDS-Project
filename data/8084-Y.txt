I strongly support this new rule. Since it will not only help the US government retain more talented students around the world, but also create new job opportunities for American people. And I believe the choice of those US employers. Only best of the best students could be hired. These students will help US discover new business possibilities, which will contribute to the expansion of whole job pool.
