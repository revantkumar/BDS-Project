I strongly agree to this proposed rule on OPT STEM extension. I believe the proposed rule is beneficial to both the country and foreign students because of the following reasons. 
1. It attracts more talented international students to pursue academic degrees in higher education institutions in the United States. With more top international students, not only will the universities have more diversified environment, more tuition income, but also more talents to contribute in the academic studies so that the universities in the United States can stay highly competitive in academic frontiers among the world.
2. The 24-month extension of OPT helps the high technology companies keep talented people and boost the economy in the country. The STEM fields include mathematics, science, engineering, and computer information which are the most important fields in all high technology industries. Companies in such industries are one of the major contributors in the economy. With longer extension the companies can get more talented people and have them contribute with a longer time, which helps boost the economy. Imagine the talented international scientists and engineers in the high technology industries all choose other countries to study, work, and live over United States, what will it look like for the economy of country?
3. The proposed rule also benefit the students. It helps international students to get more practical training opportunities in the country. The students can also make more contributions to the country after they study and graduate from universities. It's a win-win situation. Singapore government offers scholarships to attract talented international students to study there as long as they are willing to work in Singapore for 5 years after graduation. Giving more opportunities to international students will benefit the country because they can apply what they learn and contribute to the country.
