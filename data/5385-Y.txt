Bill Jackson I strongly agree with this rule! Students will leave US, in the middle of their practical training with half-baked experience, if the OPT stem is not for a minimum of 3 years. It takes a total period of 4 years to master the field experience of stem ( like IT experience without 4 years of practical experience is not preferred by an employer).OPT Stem extension should be for 24 months.
