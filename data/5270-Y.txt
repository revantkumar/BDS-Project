I SUPPORT IT!
Where can we find so many engineers, data analysts and scientists without the extension!
Why are we driving these excellent students to Canada and work for them? Traditional industry is declining all over the world, and that's why finding a job is difficult. Don't blame these students, because we really need them!!
