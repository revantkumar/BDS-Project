I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

As the most developed country in the world, United States stay ahead of the world because it see the value of diversity. From the independence of US, lots of immigrants contributes to the prosperity of United States. 

Moreover, as a country that values the human rights, it does not make any sense to deprive the working rights of international students if they are qualified to contribute to the development of US.
