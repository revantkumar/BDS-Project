United States is a country constituted by people in many different nationality, people are contribute to society and merged to a big family. Many young and potential students came to US to study, work; their hard work is making contribution to society, pushing entire country move forward. 
i.e. how many of Nobel prize people at US are originally from another country? 
How many of foreigner students, worker has take intermediate, high position at varies of aspects, and creating more and more job and opportunity to everyone.
How many of my friends I have seen that they want find a job at US but doesn't have enough time to find a job who willing to sponsor H1 visa to them?

OPT STEM is a great way to provide more time to those students to prove their ability to employer that they deserve and qualify for H1 visa, and their hard work will help, beneficial the society and keep our country on the way to be better and better. Especially at some field which it has a large amount of opening to find the right candidates.

During past decades, uncounted talent people came to US as foreigner and stayed built their home at this land, which is full filled of opportunity, freedom, and challenging; they made and keeping doing great contribution to the country, and keep this country keep young, keep growing, keep learning, and stay strong. 

I sincerely hope OPT STEM can became valid law, and keep the gate open to people who are coming to help!
