Alex Wiseman The US needs high-skilled immigrants in STEM. It would be a great loss for the country if the extension is dropped. There is a raging debate in the UK about a similar issue where the universities have lost considerable quality w.r.t the number of research papers published and also considerable funding in lieu of international student fees(since the UK stopped being lucrative to foreign students). It's a world of pain for students to get to the US for a quality education. Lets not make it worse & loose out on them. Welcoming talented outsiders is the hallmark of any successful society. To stop that would be the worst mistake it could do. What would the Roman empire have turned out to be if they had closed their doors to talented 'outsiders'? Heck, some of their best emperors like Trajan were outsiders.
