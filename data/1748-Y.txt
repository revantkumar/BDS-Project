I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. where it's a country of immigrants and a lot of distinguished scientists who made tremendous contributions to this country were international students before, just looking back at the history.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition enables the country to make progress, to succeed.
