Abhijeet M I strongly support the proposal to expand and strengthen the STEM program. I would also like to add that a period of 24 months is *not* sufficient, and it does not provide enough time for Graduate degree-holders to process their permanent residence and citizenship. STEM graduates should be allowed to work on STEM OPT extension for as long as they need, until their green card processing is through. 

Several economic studies have concluded time and again that skilled immigration *adds* jobs to the US economy[1][2]. 40% of Fortune 500 Companies (are) Founded by Immigrants or Their Children[3]. Hence the claim that the technology job-market is a zero-sum game, and that the OPT program adversely affects American workers is blatantly inaccurate.

Today the United States attracts the top Engineering talent from all over the world. We risk shutting off our source of the world's best talent, if potential international students are worried about their prospects of being able to work in the United States after graduation. Not re-issuing the OPT STEM extension law will harm innovation in the country, and our technology companies will be forced to reduce/close their United States offices entirely in favor of opening new offices abroad in search of talent.
