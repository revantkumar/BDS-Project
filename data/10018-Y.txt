Christopher Schuyler The proposed OPT Program is an unconscionable affront to American workers and students. It is proof positive that the U.S. government has been captured by big business and big tech interests who care not one iota about the interests of American citizens. No, it's profits all the way--no matter the cost to Americans. Funny how the U.S. government knocks on the doors of ordinary Americans when it's time to pay taxes or fight wars, when it's nowhere to be found when it comes to protecting Americans in their own country from competition from foreigners in the workplace. Statistics show that the tech talent allegedly wanting in the U.S. is in abundant supply! It's just that big, special interests want to pay for cheaper help from abroad. If this is allowed to pass, I will do my utmost to ensure that politicians--either party--who support OPT will pay at the polls!
