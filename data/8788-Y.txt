I strongly support the opt extension. 

I am a potential Chinese student who are applying for MFE master in U.S. Actually, most of the banks in U.S are willing to hire students from top MFE program and most of the students in MFE programs are international students. However, international students would have less incentive to go abroad receiving study if they are not granted a basic guarantee for them to find junior jobs once graduating from the program. Even they still want to receive the study, they would emphasis more on going back to their own country, which is actually a disaster for those banks since they have the tough demand on junior students conducting some administrative work. Without us, who would be willing to receive job with low pay but high pressure? Without us, who can replace us to fill the gap in those banks? 

The U.S should embrace all the skillful people and that is the reason why it is called United States.
