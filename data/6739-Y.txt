I strongly SUPPORT the proposal!!!

And this is a win-win decision for both US citizens and international students for the following reasons:

1. Most work or internship positions that international students get are those US citizens are unwilling to do. So the competition does not exist.

2.Every year only thousands students can legally work in US. And the US economy is expanding far more faster. More working position are created than being occupied by international students.

3.Most international students only want to practically utilize the knowledge they learn in US universities for a short time. I can guarantee that most students only want to generate some working experience and they plan to return to their own country after that.

So they will not threaten US citizens' benefits.
