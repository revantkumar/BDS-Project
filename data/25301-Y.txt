As an international student in US, I have seen many advantages that international students can offer. The most important thing is that most international student are much more likely to do hard works, which some residents wouldn't like to do. Since I'm a student of Computer Science major, In industry, usually international students are coding all the time. Without these software engineers, it would be a destruction of the high technologies. Expanding OPT for international students would be an wise decision, because it would be difficult for these high-tech companies to fill this huge shortage of human resources. Furthermore, if US stops providing the opportunity, more and more international student would choose to leave. Among them, there will be a lot of talent ones. It would be a loss for America.
