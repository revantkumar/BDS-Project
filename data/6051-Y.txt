I support the new STEM program rule for extending the employment period to 24 months. I also agree with the idea of providing salary information, and the employment status information.

But the new mentorship and training program is a huge burden to any employer. 
Every STEM OPT student will have to explain to the employer these guidelines now which is not applicable to CPT or regular OPT students. Here the 'Practical Training' policy becomes vey inconsistent across different programs.

Secondly, with this sort of documentation requirement, we are basically asking employers to turn themselves into educational institute or training institute, which they are not. 

There is difference in academia and real world, that's why a student needs practical training or on the job training. We learn different skills in our studies, during our practical training we try to implement some of them which can enable the supervisor/leader and the organisation on the whole to achieve their goals. But looking at I910 draft, it appears supervisor's main role is to train those who he has hired for 2 years (STEM OPT period).

Lastly, some OPT STEM students work in consulting firms too. That's because most big organization do not hire STEM graduates directly as they are unsure of our skills, because we do not have practical experience in the relevant area. Requirement for filing of H1B visa works as another hindrance. 

The consulting firms by hiring OPT students and letting them work in big firms and giving exposure to the tools that big corporations use help in increasing student's skills manifolds. Now the STEM students and consulting firms will have to explain these scenario's and documentation to client's too.

The crux of the matter is most students in OPT do actual work just like other employed workers. That we learn skills is just by-product of the actual work we do. It is not "Training" and to treat it as one is a judgement far removed from reality.
