I strongly support the proposal since this proposal can give F1 students enough time to apply what they learned in university and make contribution to science and engineering area, which are very important for the economy currently. It's a very good time for this proposal as well, more and more job has been created in STEM area, and economy benefit and rely on engineering increase each year. I strongly support expanding training opportunities for F1 students.
