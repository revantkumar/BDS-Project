I think the proposal is good for everyone. Graduate students from diverse background and the best from all over the world come to US for studies and it would be a great loss to not use their skills and creativity. They start new companies creating jobs and make the industries in US stay competitive in an increasingly globalized world which in turn protects existing jobs and creates additional jobs. Imagine all these talent at a company in a different country competing against US, which is already happening as Asian companies gain market share around the world. The world is flat and fiercely competitive and innovation is the key to sustain growth which in turn needs highly skilled people from diverse background.
