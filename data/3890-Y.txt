I don't undertand why some people are just keep talking about a misunderstanding that intl. students would accept low wage in order to get a job. I mean, the average salary of intl. STEM student are MUCH HIGHER than the average pay in the U.S. These data and statistics are really easy to find, so I won't waste time to post it here.

To be honest, the U.S. is not my first choice when I decided to study abroad. I got offers from several countries, including France, Germany, and the U.S. It was hard for me to decide because I don't need to pay tuition if I study in France or Germany; and the tuition will be 30K dollars per year if I study in the U.S. (huge amount compared to in-state student) But I still chose the U.S. for my further study because as a student study computer science, I can't deny the temptation of working in silicon valley to gain experience. But 12 month is apparently not enough for anyone to gain enough experience and really learn something.

I wish I could be a well-trained professional and back to my country with 2-3 years experience, not with a 12 month internship experience.

The higher education institutions in the U.S. will no longer be attractive to me if there is no OPT extension. I need to practice what I learned to make sure the expensive tuition I paid really helped me.
