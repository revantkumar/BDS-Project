Yiming Zhao I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:

We studied in U.S. university and got a lot of knowledge in this country. It is time for us to keep making contributions to the U.S..

In the U.S., diversity is really important. A lot of people who get the big achievement in the U.S. are not from U.S.. But they still keep contributions to the U.S., like CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella.

Competition does exist in anywhere. But it is not a negative thing. F1 students get the job, because the U.S. citizens can not fit this job. It does not mean we take the bread out of U.S. citizen's mouth.

Also, it can relief for H1B Cap-Gap. Right now, only 85000 people can approved the H1B visa. But how many people apply in last year around 200000. So OPT extension can help the students and the company. Let the students do more contributions to the U.S..

In these reasons, I strongly support to improve and expand training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees.
