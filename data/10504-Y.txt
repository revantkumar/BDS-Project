Charity Moschopoulos I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S. and to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. This is a good initiative that I support and encourage the adoption of.
