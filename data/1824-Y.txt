I support extending the OPT program for students with a STEM degree. 

I read some of the comments under the proposal. I would like to express my opinions for this comment. 

" One of my kids is a STEM worker. He has worked very hard to get where he is today to learn his job, be an exceptional employee, earn promotions and, most importantly, take care of his family. 

Why should a foreigner be able to swoop in and take a job from a Hard Working American without a need for them to have that job other than a whim by our government?

Why does our government want to destroy our middle class and put families into possible financial ruin because they no longer think Americans are worthy of a STEM job?

There is something seriously wrong with a system that so easily replaces Hard Working Americans with less skilled foreigners. "

It is true that many Americans work really hard and really brilliant, but it is really not wise to say describe foreign students as "Less skilled". I understanding your feeling as a parents, but you are not the people who select or interview talents for companies. The recruiters, managers and HRs are the people who give offers to or promote the REAL hard working people. International students works really hard in order to find a job and make good use of their expertise. According to the stats, most students who got the H1B working visa are people with advanced degrees. These people are part of the main source for economy and technology development.
