Tiffany Li I strongly support this policy. Apparently, the policy gives international student an opportunity to develope the skills they learned from their previous OPT and actually make some value to their company. But more importantly, the company is able to recover their investment on those students because of the longer employments. For my case, my company spends more than $100,000 on my first year training. And if I left the company only because of not OPT extention, all that money was wasted from the company's prospective. I think it's a similar case for most of the STEM related jobs.
