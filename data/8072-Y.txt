Grace Owen When a US company hires an international student , it has to pay extra price :
(1) To hire a international student with OPT extension, the company has to be qualified to enroll the e-verify program. This requires a lot of paper work and company's private information.

(2) In order to hire the international students for more than 2 year to complete the projects, the company also need to provide H1B sponsorship which is extremely costly. 

Obviously, hiring international students is not as convenient and cost efficient as hiring local Americans. Nevertheless, many tech companies are willing to pay for the premium price to hire the international students to keep up with their business growth. This is especially true for the big companies in IT industry such as Facebook ,Google etc. This fact can be explained by that the demand for the qualified job candidates has outpaced the supply. The U.S university are not producing enough graduates to meet the demand. If US decided to deport the international students with STEM major, it will be even more difficult to maintain its global dominance in technology.
