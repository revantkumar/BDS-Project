1. The amount of jobs available to Americans is largely determined by economic condition. Think about the horrible unemployment rate in financial crisis in 2008. Was that unemployment rate caused by introducing too many foreign workers?
2. Economy in the States has been taking the leading position because of technology advancements. 
3. Without talents from all over the world, the US cannot advance its science and technology. The productivity of an expert in programming can be 100 times better than an average programmer.
So the extension of OPT can bring in more technology talents, promote economic growth and hence provide more jobs for native Americans.
