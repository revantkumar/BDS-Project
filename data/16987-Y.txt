I strongly support the proposal of expanding the OPT for another 24 months. The reasons are listed as follows:
International students coming with F1 visas are very important to the economic and technological development of US. 
1. The students that are able to come to US already excel their classmates thanks to the high standard admission process of US universities. They either are very diligent or they are very smart or both. These highly professional people are a big part of US's high speed development in high tech such as IT, Electronic, Automobile etc. Coming from a big software company in California, The only 3 people that our group hired are all international students with F1 visas! This scenario is similar in all the high tech companies in California. 
I can't even imagine the impact on high tech companies if they are no longer able to hire these F1 students giving the low chance of H1B visa lottery.

2. With a 1-year OPT, it won't be difficult to see a discourage in attracting future international students. I believe it would be a big economical loss for the universities. 
Most importantly, a nation must be able to attract the most talented students in the world to keep its competence. By discouraging them with a much shorter OPT time is not a wise idea.
