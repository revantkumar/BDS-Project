Ji Li I strongly support OPT-extension.

As we know,the number of jobs never stays constant,it increases by the development of science and technology.If we go back to 2000 years ago most of us must be unemployed,coz the earth can't afford 7 billion peasants.Throughout the history,from the industrial revolution to the Information and telecommunications revolution,every time we make a progress in technology,tons of jobs being created.Companies such like UBER,not only creates jobs for the employee of the corporation,but also millions of drivers all over the world.The OPT-extension just works this way,gathering people in STEM fields,pushing forward technology and creates new jobs.

The OPT-extension will contribute to the GDP growth.Because of the policy that OPT-extension only applies to the people who finish their education in the United States,which attracts people to US for further study.This will not only contributes to the growth of education(because international students have to pay additional tuition,double or even triple of US residents),but also many fields related.They pay rents,which benefits the landlords;they buy cars,which benefits the car industry;they go to restaurants and go shopping,which benefits the service industry.All these things contributes the economy of United States in visible or invisible ways.

In all,OPT-extension can both creates new jobs as well as pushing the economy of United States,that is the reason I support it.
