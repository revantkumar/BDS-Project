Jeffrey Sterling I strongly support OPT extension.

We have lots of new joiners this year. Among those new employees I still think the international student is the most capable. I am telling truth. She is more efficient and hard working. When I hire a local, I still need to hire an IT support to help them, while the Chinese girl I hire can handle everything by herself. When we started the recruiting process, we got more locals into our interview process because we didn't wanna bother ourselves for working VISA. But international student did perform better in the interviews and at work. Especially now she is already the key person of our team, we all like her. It would be a big loss for us if she needs to leave because of her opt extension is invalid. Also we already tried to get her H1B this year but she was just not lucky enough to be picked up by the lottery system. It would be great if we can keep her longer and help her file H1B petition next year.

BTW, our kids really need more competitive fellows to make them realize the cruel of the society.
