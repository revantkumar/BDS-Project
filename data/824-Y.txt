I strongly support the new STEM OPT extention. This never meant America placed foreigners ahead of citizens. Actually those companies are still willing to hire a US citizen over a international student if they have the same level of working ability. Foreign students pay higher tuition to come to the US for study. They also pay the tax. They did stimulated the economy. They have to be much better at work to compete with those US citizens. Like if an international score 90, and a US citizen score 90. the companies will choose the US citizen of course. it means less trouble and paperwork. But if an international score 90, and a US citizen score 50. I am sorry, the US citizen should lose this opportunity. this(OPT extention) is the best way to form a healthy competition. Otherwise those US citizens would just sitting there relaxing and do nothing about their jobs.
