I strongly support the proposal. 

It is difficult neglect how much the academia has benefited from diversity. The industry should be as open too. 
If you take a look of the population of students in graduate programs, a large number are international students. We, me being one of them, have been trained to fit the American industry. It will be a loss for the companies if they refuse to take us, and instead hire people without sufficient training.
