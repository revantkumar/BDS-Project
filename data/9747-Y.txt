As a future care giver, I choose American to fulfill my goal to be a dietitian, I really cherish this opportunity of two-year duration, as we know America and China are the aging country in the future, both countries need increasing caregivers to take care those people who need help. If I can learn more knowledge which would be great that as we know China has relatively weak nutrition system that prevention of illness is priority in public health. Thus I do support the extension.
