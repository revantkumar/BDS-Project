Foreigners are not stealing American jobs.
I am confident that the Silicon Valley in USA is thriving not just because of American talent (eg. Satya Nadela(Microsoft), Sundar Pichai(Google), Indira Nooyi(Pepsico)). These people didnt steal CEO jobs right.

Even today, if an eligible American has applied, the company will always give him/her preference compared to an F1 student. 
The student is only interested to do a job by which he can make a difference in the STEM field. Is that too silly?

America has most of the Headquarters of the bigshot companies. So, America. Had it been Taiwan, I am sure, all students would have wanted to work there.
