Please do not do this. We need to be hiring American workers unless there is a job that no American is qualified to do. As soon as there is an American to do the job they should get it.
We are sending an awful lot of our technical expertise back overseas everytime we do this while at the same time denying an American a job.

We made it for many years with American workers. We do not need Foreign workers. Employers like them because they can pay them less. Make it worthwhile for Employers to hire Americans.
