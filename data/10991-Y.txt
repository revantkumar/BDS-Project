As an American citizen, I believe this policy can actually bring help to the American society. THe reasons why the U.S. Is so powerful right now is somehow related to the immigration friendly policy. These policies offer opportunities to the students who actually own some talents and could contribute to the economy of our country. By the way there is some real misunderstanding of how people think the minimum wages has something to do with the international students since their minimum wages to stay is far higher than the real minimum wages.
