Nonimmigrant Students made lots of contribution for US tech industry. Just take a look of all best tech companies, you will find many best employees who were a nonimmigrant students before.

And how did they get into those best tech companies? They are/were all on themselves! They are the best from their countries and came to US for opportunity. They work very hard in school and get little for return (especially those PHD students who get wages less than minimal wages and worked as research assistant for years). And finally, they graduated, competed with everyone who applied for a position in the best company they dreamed for, and got it. No one ever gave them any advantages in these competition, and sometimes they were even facing disadvantages as a foreigner in this country as they don't have as much social connection here as native students. By all by their hard working and talents, they could stay here and made huge contributions to US tech, science and economy.

To ask the best talents from all over the world go back to the place where they came from after they received American education can't be more wrong.
