Please stand up for your American family and mine. We live a small university town and know first-hand how privileged the foreign students are. After a wonderful education almost free then because of their tax reduced status they always get the best jobs, mainly in teaching and research at this university. Please train, pay and hire at least on a even level. Thank You OG Carney
