I strongly support this OPT extension .

I'm a house owner in Brooklyn, my house have rent to a lot of foreign students, they are easy going and easy to geting along with, not noisy as other tenants. Every month on the same day I will receive the coming month's rent, they never pay me late. I always saved the money for my little girl's tuition. And they also help me with my house work and my girl's school work. There's a girl she got two offer, both from big company, after graduation. She's so smart and self-discipline. When I asked how long she's gonna stay in this country, she said "I don't know", she told me about the extension. That's the reason I comment here. I think our country really deserve to have such excellent girl. If they go, who's gonna rent my house ? And who 's gonna help me to pay for my daughter' tuition?
