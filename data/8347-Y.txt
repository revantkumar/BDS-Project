I support this rule. Either way, we should not going BACKWARDS on this issue at least. If this rule was denied, you are forcing intelligent international students who wants to stay in America a little bit longer than one year to think of other ways to be here. Moreover, it's going to greatly impact America's image in the world, thus influencing the economy from many aspects. America is always that open and equal country. Please help building that image by not objecting this rule. Thanks!
