Bharath Sreenath I strongly support the extension as well. It's due to the interactions that's fostered between student of different nationalities that in the long run, Many such students contribute by starting businesses themselves or come together to add value to the economy. 

The extension will allow students to add more value both in the academic and the non academic sectors.
