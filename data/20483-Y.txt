I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It is common sense that talents are the most valuable resource. The current prosperity of America was attributed to talent recruiting policies after world war II directly. Extending OPT is a good way to retain more real talent people from international students. In the long run, the talents who still stay in our country will make huge contributions to our country. In my personal case, I have several employees from Asia, they all did very well in their jobs. What's more, it's very difficult to find enough talents if I don't search potential employees from international students. 

2. International students do not have direct competition relationship with US citizens. It is not fair but I still have to admit that if I can find a citizen or permanent resident for the position I won't hire OPT or H1B holders because of the cost. In 99% cases, companies was forced to hire non-citizens because they cannot find the right employee from native talent pool. The high technology industry is a good example that they cannot survive without hiring foreign talents. 

3. In addition to the last point, International students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level. 

4. The fact that international students often get high salary jobs also means they are required to pay more tax and to take more responsibilities. 

I suggest thinking about the following questions.
1. Who really lead to the unfair competition?
2. Who don't pay tax but make use of lots of social resource?
3. What really makes one unable to find a good job?
4. Who work harder than us but get less than us?
