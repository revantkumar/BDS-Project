There will be a lot of good results if the OPT extension policy are passed. The disadvantage for banning OPT extension is obvious and there are potential severe outcomes. Following is just some simple fact that you might find helpful for your decision-making. The OPT program as a good training program aids vast attraction to international students for coming to US to accomplish their college study. According to the Department of Commerce 2014, the international students contribute 27 billion dollars to the US economy in a single year, which is equivalent to the market value of Yahoo! For a four-year period, this group of people contribute around 110 billion dollars to the economy, which is more than half market value of Warmart, twice of Target and thrice of Adobe. Just thinking about how many jobs can be added if we have another two companies like Target? You cannot simply ignore it. Furthermore, this number is increasing because of the OPT extension policy. Banning OPT extension is an unwise action, which will certainly lower the attraction of US education system and further reduce the economic contribution from this high-increasing, long-standing group of people. Trading 4 billion dollar loss in tax to exchange for 110 billion gain in the economy is a good deal. I believe everyone will make the correct calculation. So I agree with the OPT extension policy.
