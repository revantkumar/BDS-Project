Hongxiang Jia I am strongly agree federal's plan about the extension plan for STEM non-immigrant students. 
United States is a developed country and have the most advanced technology in the world. The nation is full of ethnic diversity. To maintain the high level with the technology and diversity , United States need person with ability to work for the big companies like Google, Facebook , Intel etc. These companies will supply more and more jobs in the upcoming years. If United States can not retain these talented people , the moving forward speed will be reduce. History have proved that a country can not progress with a single mind. 
Above all , I highly suggest the law should be passed, let overseas people and native guys work together and who know what kind of sparks can be invited! Einstein or Newton even can not succeed with cooperation with each other! Let us make US better!
