I really endorse the proposed rule. Not only it can help support the continuous economy and technology development of U.S., but also it will driving the stepping forward of human's technology by allowing talents from all around world to communicate their 
ideas with each other. 

The proposed rule should be paid great attention, since U.S. society would definitely benefit from the issue of it from many aspects like I mentioned before.
