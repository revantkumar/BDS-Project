The USA is in the worst slowdown for jobs for USA citizens since the Great Depression. Young people who are citizens ought, it seems to me, be given first chance at these low paying or entry jobs.Is it not the obligation of the Congress to helpo American citizens first?If Congess puts non-citizens first, how does this build a "a patriotic" country? I hope that Congress gives these proposals very serious thought.?
