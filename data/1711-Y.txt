I fully support this 24 month STEM OPT ruling. Not only because it's fair to give benefits to International Students who come to the US paying more than $200,000 in tuition/living expenses for undergrad STEM Degrees and about the same amount for graduate STEM Degrees, but also because it contributes to the economy of the country. There is for a fact that the economy lacks of US professional to cover the high demand of STEM professionals required and this is the reason why this ruling was proposed in 2008 in the first place. Moreover, it also benefits the companies because there is more offer of STEM professional in the market and therefore salaries tend to go down to a reasonable average (offer and demand curve). Finally, the government also increases its revenues from all this STEM professionals that are paying taxes to contribute to the development of this great nation.
