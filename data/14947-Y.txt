I strongly support the rule with my own story.

1. I got my green card because US government regard me as an Outstanding Professor/Researcher. The reason I can get my H1B visa to apply the green card is I have enough OPT time. Extending OPT time can help US companies hire more qualified international employee which can not be hired locally. 

2. It does not reduce the opportunities for the native American. US need to increase global competence and US native people need to work harder. 

3. My girlfriend is also from China and she got her master degree in education here. She is a elementary school teacher in a charter school. Because she does not have enough OPT time and she did get the H1B lottery this year, she lost her job and has to go back to China. Good education helps US young people and US is lack of good educators. Because of the limited time for OPT, more and more similar stories will happen in the future.
