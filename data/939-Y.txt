I strongly support this new STEM extension proposal. Not only because it helps a lot international students to get more chance in America, also because it will actually help American themselves. 
A lot of foreign students come to study in American and want a few years' work experience and then go back to their home country, but current OPT time period is too short, which will force the foreign students to try to apply H1B visa, and later stay in America even longer. 
With this new STEM extension proposal, foreign students now don't need to rush for H1B anymore and can have 2 ~ 3 years's working experience in America, and then leave. It will actually help American themselves since more foreigners will choose to work in short term instead of staying in America forever.
