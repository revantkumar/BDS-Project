Tom Pinkman As a professor in a research-oriented university, I fully support the new law submitted by DHS to facilitate the STEM students' OPT extension. From a longer vision, we could anticipate that these highly qualified students would boost the US economy and help create many more jobs and opportunities for the American people. 

We all know that at a global competition environment, the talents from worldwide are those we should readily seek for, just as what we did back in the 40s and 50s in the 20th century. The US economy can fly as what we have already witnessed after the World War II, largely due to the absorbing power of our government to attract the top talents from other countries.
