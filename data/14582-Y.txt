I strongly support the new 24 months STEM extension rule.

After I graduated from Ph.D degree. I started to work on a Bioinformatic research project supported by NSF at University of Florida. This project is expected to take 2-3 years. If STEM OPT extension is revoked. I have to make an early leave and leave the half-baked project behind. Not only I lose my job but also it costs at least 1 year to hire and train a new researcher for replacement.
