I intensely support this proposal. In the past century, immigration has made indelible contributions to U.S., especially in the area like science and engineering. The great efforts made by these immigrated people are the fundamental source of progresses and innovations for U.S. industries and technologies.
I disagree that this proposal will affect job market for current U.S. citizens. Today, high technology is growing by an incredibly rapid speed. To lead this area in the world, U.S. needs lots of skilled people in STEM related majors. However, the amount of local people involved now is obviously not enough to support this industry. Attracting talent people from foreign countries to work for U.S., is in the interest of all U.S. citizens. These STEM related people are not competing with local residents but help them as the huge fortune generated in STEM area gives benefits to every single individual in this country.
I believe this proposal is crucial for the future of U.S. Rejection of this proposal will definitely be the loss of U.S. high technology industry and can cause decays of economy in the whole U.S.
