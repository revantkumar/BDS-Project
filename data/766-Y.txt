I can't say I'm not frustrated when I saw hatred comments below that I once navely believed most Americans are rational and considerate. I'll list some facts about myself, please read this and think about it again.

While most of citizen UC students enjoy grants, finaid, and scholarships, I have to pay my tuitions nearly 50,000 dollars a year. 
In addition, as a mechanical engineering students, I see companies have have done well enough to protect American jobs because they will accept Americans and Americans only.
What's more, I think the reason Japan and Europe suffer so much from economical recessions while America doesn't is just because the new immigrants have brought their knowledge, wealth, and ideas to this country. We will wait and see what will happen if this act don't pass.
For ordinary Americans, although they can enjoy benefits while international student doesn't, international students have to put much much more efforts to adapt to American culture and overcome language barriers. Now, they graduate and become the right person to serve American economy. Do you think what they have learnt is gonna work in a system other than America since these years if you just simply send them back to their motherland? 
I hate to say this, but one will still and never find a job if he just sit back and have everyone else to blame. You can't find job just mean you can't. You shut door to immigrants won't make any differences.
Please, ask yourself, are you working hard enough that gonna make yourself cry at night as I do? Why companies should hire the worst instead of the best?
This act, brings justice and is the final ground for international students to compete equally with natives. Isn't that what spirit of America stands for? Isn't that the reason American universities bring us here?
