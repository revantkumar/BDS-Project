We must persuade STEM students to stay.They are the most talent people in science and engineering in the world.

If we refuse the expanding of OPT, these students who received best higher education in the world cannot serve us anymore.

Our higher education system is highly supported by our government.That is to say if we deny STEM students to stay, we are using our taxes educate our future opponents.
