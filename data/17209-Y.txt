I support this rule. Tech industry is very important for US. How can you allow foreign students go to US to learn the state-of-the-art, and then go back to serve their own country just because they do not have OPT to find a STEM job? Now tech companies are looking for STEM employees, and if they cannot find enough talents in US, they will just move to other countries, like China or India. Please help to keep STEM talents in US.
