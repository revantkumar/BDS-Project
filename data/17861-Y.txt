I strongly recommend this proposed rule.
First, the extended OPT will give student more time to get the real-life experience about the skills they have learned. This is partly the reason that makes American's higher education a better choice for international students.
second, more start-up American companies will benefit from this extension. They can hire skilled workers but pay them less.
Third, America is a country of immigrants. If people try to work hard to stay here, there is no reason to reject them. Forget those anti-immigration thoughts. This is the land of the Free and home of the Brave.
