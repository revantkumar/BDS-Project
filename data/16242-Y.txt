I'm glad to see this proposal under discussion and I sincerely hope it will be approved. If this proposal fails, thousands of Hi-tech companies will lose their employees or be affected in negative ways. STEM students who are actively seeking employment may lose their legal status and have to leave United States. There is no doubt US companies will lose many professionals in science and IT industries and this certainly will harm US economy. I believe OPT extension rule was approved to boost US economy and encourage foreign students to contribute to US economy. The bad consequence is certainly opposite to what US government's initial intention. As far as I see American workers absolutely have priorities over foreign students when being considered by employers. US government should encourage more American students to study STEM majors instead of harming the benefit of foreign students who have hard worked and contributed to US economy so much. Please approve this proposal in consideration of US economy.
