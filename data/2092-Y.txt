James Barnett, Purdue University This has got to stop! No incentive to hire legal citizens, in fact there is no incentive at all! But yet you give preferential treatment to Foreigners, that cannot speak english, hate our ideology and were not attractive to their own countries work force. In addition to this, they are not required to assymilate, pay taxes, or SSI, yet they qualify for free housing, Food Stamps and SSI assistance. This violates the very Immigration Laws, our Congress passed and violates every Americans right to be treated equal in the sight of the Law! The only Foreigners we should allow are Christian Refuges, fleeing Islamic Sharia, sweeping the world like a plague. At least then the workers might share our Judeo/Christian Ethic and desire to assymilate to our culture and herritage. No more Pagan welfare recipients, kicked out of their countries, for being too radical!
