I strongly support that the STEM OPT to be extended to 24 months. It is both beneficial to American companies and the American citizens.
For most of the American companies who largely rely on cutting-edge technologies, hiring foreigners who have learned the high-tech skills right after graduated from their colleges in USA is both cost saving and profitable. These foreigners who just obtained the fresh and cutting-edge skills earn much less money compare to their native peers and in order to survive, they tend to work harder and obey more to their boss. 

On the other hand, we can see that the newcomers not only bring in different fresh culture but also stimulate consumption in the surrounding area. Newcomers,especially these new young people spend more money in America, which helps a lot to the local society in terms of economy and culture. 

If the government stop the OPT extension for STEM major students. tens of thousands of students who plan to contribute to this country in a relatively long term have to go back to their countries or other countries who are more open and friendly for them to work and live. Also those who plan to study in America in the future may probably change their mind and switch to other countries to pursue their dreams, maybe China, India or Russia. 

Therefore, I strongly supportive this OPT extension proposal.
