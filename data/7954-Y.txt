I strongly SUPPORT this proposal:

Now most Americans do not want to learn STEM major especially Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. However, the companies, such as Apple, Google, Amazon hired students who mainly majored in STEM. These companies play important roles in America's Economy. If this proposal is not approved, the majority of international students will go back to their own countries. That means these companies would not hire enough students to help them. Then these companies will become weaker and weaker. Therefore, this phenomenon will affect America's Economy seriously.

Secondly, this proposal will benefit United States too. It will give international students three years to contribute America because international student will have three opportunities to get H1 visa. Besides, if more and more international students can get H1 visa, there will be more excellent student come to this country.
