OPT is an essential piece of policy that will benefit both sides ( US economy & foreign students )
Take my field, computer science for example. This is a fast growing industry, US is not necessarily in an absolute leading position in the world. Count how many IT companies currently survive in China then you will know how fierce the competition is in this field.

To win the competition, all countries are fighting for talented people, a large portion of them being good engineers. They are the main force pushing forward the IT economy, which is the fastest growing one right now.

Good engineers can find jobs easily in every place in the world. Currently most of them choose to stay in US basically because of the good policies implemented in US. If OPT extension is cancelled, while there is still a cap on H1B visas, I don't think US will be that attractive any more.
