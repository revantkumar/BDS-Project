This proposal should be passed. The way we help our Americans to find a job should not be simply banning the foreign talents from seeking a job in our country. In the proposal, all companies that hire foreign students should be e-verified, which means that they are supervised to be fair to all candidate. Fairness and diversity is the basic principle we (the great Americans) are always holding. I cannot believe that some people is trying to destroy this. These people should focus on themselves. If they are good enough, they definitely will find a job.
