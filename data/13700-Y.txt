I strongly support this initiative. Foreign students studying in the United States have access to some of the best educational resources here and can contribute to the economy and innovation in the industry. I think this creates an environment of equal opportunity and promotes merit. As someone who has been employed in the tech industry, I know that merit makes a lot of difference and directly impacts a company's product. I also do not believe that this rule would deprive American citizens of jobs simply because a) They hire based on merit and how good a person is nothing to do with nationality b) They pay everyone equally regardless of nationality c) Culturally, American citizens have an advantage over foreign students. I think this rule will also benefit students with ambitions to start out on their own, thus creating more jobs in the economy.
