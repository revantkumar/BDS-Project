I support the OPT extension plan. As a current graduate student in science major, I believe the OPT extension program could benefit the U.S. industry and education directly. The new immigrants contribute a lot to the science, technology and economy prosperousness in the U.S.. The U.S. should continue to keep an open mind and welcome international STEM students to contribute their knowledge here.
