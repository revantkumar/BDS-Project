I believe the OPT extension is a beneficial not only to the international students but also to the American citizens and society. 

Firstly, many international students have scholarship or assistantship. The universities invest a lot of money and time to bring up these professionals in different domains, and it will be a pity that they cannot serve the United States society after they graduated. 

Secondly, if the OPT is only one year, or even less, fewer and fewer international students will come to US universities to study, as they know the opportunity for them to get a job in US is very small. There is already a vivid example, the United Kingdom. People in China now prefer going to US universities much more than going to UK's universities because they know it's so hard for international students to find a job in UK. Fewer international students will have negative influence to the US universities, cities and society.

US cities do need international students, as the students always boost the local economies. Example: Berkeley, which is a small town, is all about the University of California, Berkeley. And there are more than 10000 international students enrolled in UC Berkeley right now. They need food, accommodation, clothes and entertainment. Imagine what will happen to the small town Berkeley if the 10000 international students are gone. The same with the relationship of Clemson University and Clemson city. Clemson City's economy also heavily depends on Clemson University. 

The universities also need international students. Not only because they are hard working, but also they bring diversity. Diversity brings more objective academic environment and most importantly, creativity. Creativity is the initial power to push productivity and economy of a society. 

Above is my personal opinion of the OPT extension policy and its possible influence. Generally I believe the OPT extension is a win-win policy. Thank you for reading this long comment.
