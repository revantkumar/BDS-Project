Students will work for peanuts, depressing wages and adding additional laborers to an already overfilled market.
We already see this in towns with large universities and large populations of foreign students.
After their time here, they will return home and transfer their skills to a foreign company. More likely, they will get hired by one
of the mass slave-agencies from India and immediately transfer to H1B status, further depressing wages and job opportunities for Americans.

Take a look at the names of people commenting here. How many of these are American citizens?

This is yet another example of our government devaluing the American worker.
