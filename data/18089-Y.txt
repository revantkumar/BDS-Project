I support Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. 

STEM students are well trained with advanced knowledge and skills. By employing those students longer allowed by this regulatory action, American employers could acquire those advanced knowledge and skills better and help the growing of their own business. 

This regulatory action may also better attract more potential students to choose to study in America. It allows them to learn Americans culture and bring it back to their motherland after their study.
