STEM is life for AMERICA. Please approve the regulation.

Let's go back to our school. How many students are working in this field and too many students want to do business. BUT we need MORE ENGINEERS and SCIENTISTS especially for the high tech companies. 

PLEASE NOTE: when we are enjoying the American-Brand electronics, please reconsider why. Because we could compete with others. If we lose the competition. We won't have a future.
