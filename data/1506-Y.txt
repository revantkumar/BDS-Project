Amitesh Saha I STRONGLY SUPPORT the OPT stem extension rule proposed here by DHS. It is good for the high tech industries which are going to benefit enormously as they can retain specialized, highly skilled employees with MS or PhD from a US school. The US economy will be highly benefited from this.

I have read a lot of comments that have been posted so far for this OPT STEM extension rule and it is surprising to see how people who are opposing it, are mostly doing it not understanding properly what this is going to do for the American economy. I understand that they are thinking that their jobs are stollen, but that is not correct. It doesnot apply for foreign born F1 holders getting their Masters or Phd from a US university. It is not easy getting a job as Scientist or a researcher after your graduate school as companies are hesitant to hire foreign born candidates, unless they are best of the best.Once you get selected,its primarily because you are highly specialized. I guess you have every right to keep your job and contribute to the economy by helping companies achieve technical edge. I see that companies have hard time finding right candidates for research positions. Thats a fact! This rule helps these companies to retain talents.

I think its a fair deal. You get US education , you should have the opportunity to contribute to the economy and help industries be world leaders in their fields. This proposed rule is going to be a highly beneficial for F1 visa holders and the US tech industry in general.
