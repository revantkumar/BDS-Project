Please do not allow any more or extend the time foreign student ar allowed to take spots in our colleges and universities as American children are unable to get into many colleges and universities as they are over crowded with many foreign students already. American children need a chance to receive STEM degrees and many colleges in California and other states already have a large number of foreign students taking the spot away from American children. 

Also, many companies like Qualcomm in San Diego hire these foreign workers taking jobs away from Americans. I am an engineer and have seen American children rejected from the universities that are allowing foreign students to take their spots. Our children want to get STEM degrees also but find it difficult to get accepted into the universities as they are overcrowded. Also, as an engineer, I have seen many STEM college graduates struggle to get jobs. Again, places like Qualcomm, want to hire foreign workers so they can pressure them to work longer hours. If they want to pay less to American workers that is what they should do as many engineers can not find jobs, especially if they are over 50 years old. There are many very qualified American engineers looking for work. We don't need any more foreign workers taking their spots. 

Foreign students are taking spots away from American children. The public universities and colleges are funded largely by tax payers money and yet the large majority of the local children can not get into the local universities and colleges as they are too crowded. Maybe this was not true 20 years ago but it is now. American children need a chance to get STEM educated, so they can get STEM jobs.
