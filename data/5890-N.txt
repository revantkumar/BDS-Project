It's clear the designers and supporters of the OPT programs did not grow up as poor or lower class legal residents of our country. Programs establishing favoritism and special privileges not afforded to the working class citizens smacks of political purchase in every effort to overcome Constitutional Sovereignty. Why do the Bush and Obama administrations hate law abiding citizens so much? What did we do to you? Will you now target and attack me like the IRS attacks law abiding citizens? We the people appeal to the Sovereign Living God of Love to protect ourselves from the tyranny of the lesser federal subjugation.
