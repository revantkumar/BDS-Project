I strongly recommend that we should allow this extension to pass.

As a manager for a few international workers, I felt so sad when I heard the news of OPT extension vacancy. I can't imagine the huge negative impact to them and to the company if the extension is gone forever. They are truly exceptional employees, so do many of their peers. They've done fantastic jobs. One of them was even awarded the President Award (highest award in my company). They contribute a lot to the company. I really hope that our country can retain more of talented engineers like them. We are Americans. However, the reality is opposite. A small portion of people in this country want to kick them out because they think international workers take jobs from them. What narrow minds they are! In fact, they help to boost economy in US by making ground breaking technologies, thus even creating more jobs! 

When our ancestors first came to this continent, they all have great dreams. So do international students nowadays. They already have more obstacles than most of fellow Americans. Still they out perform many of us. Let's give them more equal environment, instead of creating more difficulties!
