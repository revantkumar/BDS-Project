Jarrett D. Moore Generally, I support this rule to be implemented.
Firstly, We all know we are at an information age. Hundreds of IT companies make great contributions to our economy and advanced IT technologies also make our country lead the technology trend of the world. Do you know how many employees in those companies are from other countries? It is really important for our country to attract elite from other countries to make contributions to our society. Combination of different races and cultures is our American spirit and something we can trace in our great history.
Secondly, as far as I know, not only they can make contributions by their knowledge, also we can benefit a lot from their expensive tuition and consumption. It seems in many universities the tuition for foreign students is almost three times compared to that for local residents. What's more, during their study, they can make great contributions to local economy. They have to rent our apartments, eat in our restaurants and buy all kinds of stuff for daily use.
If we prohibit this rule, do you know how much money we are gonna lose? Do you know how great the aftereffect will be to our economy?
