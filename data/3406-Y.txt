In favor! Yes, please stop sending these great minds away after our universities spent taxpayer and donor dollars to educate them. In fact, please continue to reform the immigration system so that those who get STEM education here don't go back to countries that are dying to surpass America in innovation. We were once the nation that put a man on the moon!
