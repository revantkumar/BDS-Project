We have built a great country to serve the future of our fellow Americans.....letting
these people into the us has downgraded our educational system and our country and 
they do bring their culture permanently into every facet of American life and 
has led to our degradation......this major influx has only been going on the last
thirty years and in in sync with the degradation of a truly great country.....we 
must keep the U.S. pure as an example for the world, not to bring people here
to change it and to dilute its greatness. Americans and the government we
have elected is imminently now the greatest terrorist organization in the
United States.
