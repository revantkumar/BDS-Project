I strongly support this extension for three reasons:

1. Longer OPT ensures stable employees in those growing companies, especially those internet related companies in the Silicon Valley. Otherwise, those campanies will have to let part of their employees leave every 12 months. Thats an extremely bad news.

2. Longer OPT will make United States a more popular country for international students since they could have better chance to learn things in practice given longer period of training time.

3. More international students attracted by longer OPT stimulates the local economies of university region. Theyll need to rent houses, buy cars and find places for eating and playing. This is great for local American because more people means more money to make!
