I STRONGLY agree the 24-month OPT extension!

First, what makes Unite States so powerful? It's talents! It is the talents from all over the world that make Unite States always leading the most advanced technology in the world. If OPT extension is cancelled, many companies cannot keep their talented employees, which will lead a critical depression, especially for those famous international enterprise like Google, Facebook, etc., which are the proud of Unite States.

Secondly, OPT extension will attract more international students. As far as I know, millions of international students are applying to or studying at American universities, who not only bring universities a large amount of extra income, but also make great contribute to researches and bring universities high reputation. If you check papers published in top journals or conferences in STEM areas, you will find that about half of them are written by international students. However, if OPT extension is cancelled, international students will undoubtedly show less interest in American universities since their working position cannot be guaranteed after their graduation.

Finally, Unite States is always an open country in its 239-year history. It is always friendly to international people. Its openness is its culture, which make Unite States so unique from other countries. If the only thing that American people concerned is to close the door and refuse international people to "protect" its own citizens, it will makes their people less and less competitive and finally be exceeded by other countries in the future!
