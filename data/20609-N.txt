The Department of Homeland Security responded to a FOIA request from the Center for Immigration Studies
(http://cis.org/north/obscure-immigration-program-hurts-us-residents-both-young-and-old). According to the response,
the number of foreign college graduates from U.S. universities in their DHS-created disguise of college students,
so they can work legally increased sharply in the years 2009 to 2013. The total soared to nearly 100,000 in 2013,
and presumably is still growing. It had been at just under 74,000 in 2009. In other words, American employers
are providing on-the-job training for foreign graduates of American colleges instead of hiring American citizens that also are
graduates with little or no work experience. Increasing the time that a foreign graduate can stay in this Government "program"
will increase de facto discrimination against qualified American citizens that want to do honest work for a living.
