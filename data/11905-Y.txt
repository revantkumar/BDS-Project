I strongly support the OPT extension because this policy can bring the United States a huge number of intelligent and hard working employees every year. The reason why there are so many successful large high tech companies, as well as thousands of small startups in the United States is because the United States is attracting hundreds and thousands of intelligent people from all over the world. Once the United States stop the opening policy, these high tech companies will gradually move to India or China because they can find cheap labor, better tax policy there. 

Opposing this policy is short-sighted. Instead of bringing more jobs, American will lose more in the near future.
