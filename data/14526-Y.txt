I strongly support the proposal for the benefit of U.S. economy. Allowing international students with specialized knowledge and skills to continue attending practical training will greatly contribute to U.S. economy by providing tremendous talented man-powers. Normally, the first 3 year after graduation is the golden age/times for young people with ambitions and energy to dedicate to their jobs. No burden of families and life, only passion for advancing the career, they will work extremely hard in order to establish the foundation of the life. If U.S. government deprive the OPT rights from the foreign students, they will just go back to their own countries and make their contributions to their own countries.
