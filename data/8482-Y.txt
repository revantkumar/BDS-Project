I strongly SUPPORT the 24 month extension of OPT for STEM majors. U.S. needs talents who have STEM background, it will only make the U.S. economy more prosperous and create more jobs. It's at America's interest to have well-educated, smart, hard-working foreign students work and stay in the country. The 24 month STEM extension gives U.S. educated students an opportunity to make contributions to the U.S. society by applying what they learned. 
America is an immigrant country who embraces diversity. Throughout the history, there have been a lot of foreign students who come to the U.S. to study and work and made tremendous contributions to the country. By offering the 24 month STEM extension, we can help highly educated foreign students to add value to the American society.
