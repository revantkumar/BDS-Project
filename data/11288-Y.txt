I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. All the profits made by international students will finally donate back to US society.
