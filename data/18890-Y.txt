People who oppose this OPT expanding proposal only take the consideration of them own benefits not for the country. Most of the opposed views come from the concern that US citizens lost their opportunities in those positions, but this is not true. Companies definitely need people who are more skillful, creative and intelligent regardless their citizenship, because those people create more values to the companies and increase the economy for the country and further benefit the US citizens. Canceling the OPT extension means huge talented people will leave this country and bring their knowledge, skills and experience which they achieved in US back to their own countries and create values. And less competitive people take advantages from this, but how many values will they create for the country compare with those more qualified persons? Competition only goes against those mediocre persons but always make better people better and always benefits the whole community and simulate economic development. 
Thus I strongly support the proposal to expanding the OPT program.
