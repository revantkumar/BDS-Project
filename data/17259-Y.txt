I strongly support this extension policy.

In my opinion, foreign students come to the US and receive STEM training. During the pursuit of a STEM degree, they consumes the high-quality educational resources provided by American universities, or even, American taxpayers. The major way, in which they could compensate such a consumption, is their hard working in American companies. This also guarantees the competitiveness of US companies, because they can attract the smartest youth brains all over the world to work for them.

Some people may complain that the OPT extension would harm the worthiness of the US citizenship. This thought is very shortsighted. On the one hand, the OPT rule is for students holding F-1 visa, which is a NONIMMIGRANT status. In fact, OPT has the least impact compared to the other changes of US immigration policies. On the other hand, the OPT extension is limited for students in STEM majors, but the US companies are not STEM-only business. It can be expected that the OPT extension will encourage companies to create more STEM-related jobs, and then what? A growing company definitely need more suppliers, more managers, more drivers, more lawyers, more doctors, etc. All different kinds of job opportunities are waiting for US citizens.

Indeed, the proposed OPT extension is a win-win policy for both foreign STEM students and US citizens. I beg you support this proposal, for a brighter future of America.
