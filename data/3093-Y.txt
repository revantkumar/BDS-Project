I strongly support this proposal. It's an important step forward taken by the Homeland security to retain talented and dedicated individuals. I think it's not only beneficial to the international students but also to United states as a whole. 
By giving international students more time to work after their graduation will significantly improve their capacities to utilize the knowledge they have learned and it will also serve as a strong incentive to attract more talented people to come to United States, which in return will help United States retain international talents and increase national strength in terms of innovation, social mobility and much more other aspects.
Furthermore,history has proved that United States is not a nation that relies on heritage to rise to prosperity and success.Instead, her prosperity is founded upon a spirit of tolerance and innovation, by accepting and assimilating talented individuals with different ideologies and backgrounds, by creating opportunities not only for a small group of society but for all who have a desire and resolve to fulfill their dreams. I believe this proposal is the very continuity of that spirit which has ensured the prosperity of this nation.
