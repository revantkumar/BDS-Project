I SUPPORT the proposal.I believe America definitely benefits from the extension of the OPT for STEM students.
First the STEM student are in those areas highly important to American economy. America should make effort to keep people with talent, genius and high education to boost the economy. 
Second, they received the best education and enjoyed the best society service, it is time for them to give back to America society and make contribution to this country. Why the government let they go after giving them the limited and high-standard resources?
