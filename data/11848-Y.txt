I SUPPORT the OPT extension proposal. It's very short-sighted to blame STEM students, who paid tuition and studied for years in the US, for the unemployment of a few Americans who couldn't find jobs due to their own incompetence. The American economy is recovering from the '08 crisis faster than any other OECD economies, and a lenient highly-skilled worker policy plays a big part in it. While US-born people of the latest generations largely avoided hard-core STEM majors due to our inept K12 education system, foreign students who studied hard in these majors can fill these vacancies. But currently, the hostile attitudes from some of the Americans are taking these win-win opportunities away, and forcing these highly-skilled graduates to go back to contribute to their own economy, when they could've helped the US remain the most competitive economy in the world. WE NEED the OPT extension system to retain the best of the foreign STEM students!
