I think the OPT should be extended for the following reasons:
1) we are not taking away jobs. A lot of international students are creating jobs. After a few years of working experience, some choose to set up their own company. USA is a place where creativity becomes reality, therefore it is the perfect country for beginners to build their own companies. 
2) US companies are picky when it comes to hiring international students. They don't just hire anyone. They choose the best from the best. That being said, only a small portion of job opportunities are offered to international students. There are already laws and restrictions for international students regarding working here, and there shouldn't be more. 
3)with the extended OPT, a lot more international students would choose America instead of the UK or Canada. This benefits the US's economy as international students are paying full price without any funding for school fee or medication fee. 

So please please please, I wish to see more people supporting this policy than encouraging others to disapprove this policy. It is an important policy for international students to further improve themselves by working in the states, as well as bring more talent to US.
