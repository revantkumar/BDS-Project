In favor of the STEM extension (ICEB-2015-0002). 

The US does not produce sufficient quality technology/engineering/math students to fill the market demands. Consequently, the the CPT/OPT/H1B flow in general is not only beneficial, but necessary for the US economy. I have seen the current OPT to H1B process go awry due to the short duration or timing due to non-traditional graduation, especially with graduate students not on the usual calendar. It is critical to offer STEM in the critical verticals to assist in the transition, as it offers more time for a successful bid to the H1B lottery. Transitioning from 17 to 24 months will ensure that three instead of one lottery cycles are available to ensure that the student/employee and employer connect.

On a personal note - My company has had a great deal of success with CPT/OPT/H1B. These kids are motivated, capable, and want to become Americans. They often outshine our home-grown students in these qualities, and consequently give better overall performance. The competition is healthy for American students, and healthy for the economy as a whole. My company probably has had 80-90% foreign students for interns over the past several years because they simply are better prepared.

There is no downside to this extension. If there are insufficient jobs, the kids will get sent home anyway.
