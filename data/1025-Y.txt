I support the proposal to extend F-1 immigrant student optional practical training (OPT) time to 24 months strongly because It helps USA financially to get better.US based firms are depending on offshore firms to get support for their projects by paying in huge numbers where in these firms can hire these high skilled students instead of out sourcing the project to other countries, which also saves time as well as money to firms which in turn helps to USA.Please consider this request in extending opt period from 19 months to months.
