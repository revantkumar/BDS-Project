Chengyuan Zhuang I strongly support this Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. This will bring huge technique advantages to America, keep the No.1 status in the world, benifit lots of talent STEM students and the IT industry, and will not hurt native American workers.
