Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to support the proposed new regulations on OPT by the Department of Homeland Security for the following reasons:

(1) Students can receive great training opportunities during their OPT program so that they are better prepared for the life after graduation. Training is an essential process of the STEM education. Without sufficient training, the quality of education is compromised. 

(2) The extended OPT program will not harm the employment opportunities of the US citizens. On the contrary, students in OPT can boost the US economy by contributing their intelligence. 

Thank you!
Yanshuo
