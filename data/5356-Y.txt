Vishakha Krishna I strongly believe the STEM OPT extension should be increased from 17 months to 36months as it will be more on benefits side for US economy , US universities and the world wide fame of US .

US will be benefited with the innovative minds of the students and STEM-related disciplines are responsible for many of the societal innovations that make our world better. IBM is a partner in new schools in New York and Chicago which concentrates more on STEM education. Thus students will graduate with an associates degree, along with the skills and knowledge they need to continue their studies or transition directly into jobs in the information technology industry. These contributions by the STEM graduates will make the US economy stronger.
