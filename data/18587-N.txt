Inviting and bringing in foreign students to the U.S. is wrong. In addition to robbing Social Security from the rest of us,they will usually settle here and rob myself, children and grandchildren of jobs. Already, the Tech job markets here are saturated, making it much more difficult to obtain work for those of us who are already citizens of this country. I've been in the computer and software industry for more than 20 years, and it is more difficult than ever to find work. 

The last place I worked was saturated with Indians and Chinese that moved here under the H1B visa. Incidentally, both the department director and myself were laid off this year, but the foreign workers kept their jobs. I was born here, work hard, pay taxes and social security, and have always paid my fair share into a system that each day is one step closer to hanging me and all of its long-term citizens out to dry. We already have plenty of people in the U.S. to keep it as strong as our leaders allow. All of our higher education efforts should be put towards educating the children and adults who are already here. Please stop this action, and halt F-1 student proposition!
