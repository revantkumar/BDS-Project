I believe that such regulation would bring necessary behalf to the United States. In the recent decades we all observed that the US survived from several major crisis, both in 90s and the year 2008. Not like Japan, Europe, who is suffering a huge risk of depression, US is still keep in the leading position all over the world in innovation. The only difference between US and other countries, which leaded the survival, is the immigration policy. I strongly support the new OPT regulation because I know it is good to us, not only the current generation but also our children. People blamed such regulation because they think that the foreign students take over a "lot" of job positions so they lose their owns. It is ridiculous because when compare to the whole population of the US, the population of foreign students can be called "tiny". How could they affect you so much so that you lose your job? Oppositely, these students receive the highest quality of education here in US. We should expect them to work inside of the US, not outside, to promote the economics of the whole country, which consequentially will help creating much more jobs, than they take over right now.
