I support the 24 month extention since it will be good for US' economy. International students will not only contribute to the companies by hard working, but also they are booming the spending in US. As we know, most international students in USA are from rich families. They spend huge amount of money on consumer goods, cars and housing every year. They help areas to develop by resulting in more constructions, more diverse grocery stores and restaurants, and more schools.
In addition, to avoid the loss of experienced and high-educated international talents, US must improve the process for permanent work authorization (Green card). Most international talents choose to contribute to their home countries because after years of years service, their companies still don't sponsor permernent card. Really hope the government can regulate a unified time for starting green card application once international talents get H1B visa.
