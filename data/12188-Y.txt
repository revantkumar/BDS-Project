I think it's totally necessary to have a 24-month extension for the STEM OPT. It would have a positive effect on the industry - any industry that has F1 students as workforce. I've been working with a lot of F1 students and most of them are hardworking, smart and willing to take any challenges. 

They came all the way from their home country to a land where they don't know anyone and they don't know the language that well, just to receive a better education and a better training in their career. Think about the hustle and trouble that they've been through moving to an unknown country - they are willing to do anything and to go through any trouble for the education and the training. With such strong eager to improve themselves, I think they would do a very good job in the industry whichever they work in.
