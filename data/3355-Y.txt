STEM students bring inspiration and creation to U.S. industry. They are a leading force in the IT industry. Cancelling extension equals to forcing them to leave U.S. As a result they will have to work for the competitor company outside the U.S. Would that help U.S. industry overall?

OPT extension will not limited the choice for domestic student, on the contrary, this program will encourage good competition in the human resource market. 

Don't force outstanding students away. Cancelling the extension program will hurt U.S. industry in the long term.
