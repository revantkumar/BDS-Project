I will approve this rule for sure. This proposal is a win-win decision for our government and American employers. With this rule, more and more international students who choose to study in the US will spend money in the US, like tuition, tax, food, and other living expenses, thus creating more opportunities for US residents, and more benefits for US government. In addition, American employers will be able to hire more talent people because not many American people can perform advanced duties in STEM field, such as engineer, software development, and so on.
