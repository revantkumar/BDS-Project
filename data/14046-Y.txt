I support this proposal definitely.

My son is an engineer and unfortunately he got a occupational disease: vibration disease. Actually, his company does not have enough professional and experienced engineers. He has heavy workload and there are not many new employees who can do with him and reduce some workload. 

The new generation of US citizens are less likely to choose engineer as their occupation. I think we do need international students to do this kind of jobs. They like engineering work more and they have stronger ability to deal with some complex engineer problems. So why not provide them more chances to work in US and make more contribution to out country?
