STEM degree opt extension will make benefits to both US tech companies and US high education. First of all, with extension time international student will be more likely to go abroad to study in the US, because they won't face the situation of getting only a degree without any practical working experience to support their future job track back to their home country. Secondly, US tech companies are developing rapidly these year, while the amount of tech people with higher education are not growing as fast as the demands. That's a major driver to extend STEM student longer time to work in the US. It's a severe condition that US tech companies are not able to hire purely US citizens to meet their developing needs while keep the cost reasonably low. So, to extend opt time is not only students' needs, but also US companies' needs. In the long run, if US could always attract high level tech people and keep them actively working for US companies, it is also a great thing for US economic growth. Those tech people are spending money for car/house/daily stuff as well as making profits for their companies. Some people may argue that foreigners are competing with native people for job opportunities, IT IS NOT TRUE. If a company could hire enough native, that's fine. The problem we are facing today is that we don't have enough well educated tech people. So I strongly support the regulation to give a 24 month STEM OPT extension to give a strong faith to the company. Let the company know that they could always get enough great employer to help company develop!
