I support this proposed rule.
1. This rule benefit to the economy of United States in the long term. The hard work of talented international STEM student will create many jobs in the future.
2.The rule said that the employer will not terminate,lay off,furlough any full or part-time,temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the stem opt to the student. So it is impossible for the employer to fire a U.S. citizen worker in order to get a international opt worker.
