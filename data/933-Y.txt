I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Firstly, Diversity is very important for the U.S, which help U.S to the TOP list in the world especial in technological area.

Secondly, Both the STEM Students' study and work in U.S do help U.S to become much more prosperous.

Thirdly, some friends may worried about the competitions among native people. But actually, the STEM students usually go to those jobs where needed by thousands of companies since the Native people are not enough for their growth.
