I fully support this OPT extension. I think it is a good way to keep the country dynamic, energetic and would definitely help to increase the diversity which is necessary for the country to keep growing strongly. 

As is described in the documentation, this extension would allow the students with an US degree to work in US for an extended period of time. Two positive aspects that I have in mind would be that: first, the direct result from this extension is that it increases the chance for the graduates to receive a working visa (H1B), allowing them to work for longer time period for US employers. Every year, the US universities spent plenty of money and resources in the education and training for international students, especially true for student pursuing advanced degrees. Shortening the OPT which potentially reduces the chance that these student could work for US employer would be a significant loss of the resources. Second, this will make the job market more competitive. Not only the employers have more options in hiring the best candidate but also the extension give the employer more time to effectively evaluate the performance of the hired international students.

US has been a country comprised of immigrants and is always absorbing talented people from all over the world. This is what made US to what it is so far. If shortening OPT, as some organizations or individuals asserted, is used to protect the domestic job market, I will have say it is neither a smart nor an effective move. We always would like to hire the best people with excellent skills instead of to drive them way. Giving everyone a chance for fair play, that is going to make the country to be more competitive and prosperous.
