I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for these reasons:

1. I am a perspective student who will start my graduate study in 2016 spring. In fact, this kind of policy is a very important reason that I chose the US at the first place. I would like to have the same opportunity as the locals to work after graduation.

2. As I understand, many international students major in Computer Science benefit from this policy, so that they choose to stay in the US to start their career. I believe most of high-tech companies will support this policy as well.
