Strongly Support:

1. Shortage of STEM students would reduce the development of companies and economy, but US is falling in produce enough STEM workers.[4] The U.S. may be short as many as three million high-skills workers by 2018. Two-thirds of those jobs will require at least some post-secondary education. 74% of college graduates with STEM degrees are going into non-STEM jobs. [1] 

2. Foreign students aren't taking Americans' jobs. Unemployment rate in STEM is much lower than non-STEM. [2] Besides, STEM companies are struggling to hire STEM students. [3] It means that if an US-citizen can't find a job in STEM fields, it is because he/she is not qualified for the job, not because the competition from foreign students.

3. US is losing its leading status in the world and this process would accelerate if US continue say NO to these foreign well educated students will degrees. OPT is a policy that attract talented students around world coming to study in US. Other countries have given similar policies. If US don't extend it, US would lose these clever heads.

4. Illegal immigrants and students with STEM degrees are totally different. Illegal immigrants are not qualified for STEM job as lack of a degree in US and then find jobs in non-STEM fields with higher unemployment rate. Then US should say no to illegal immigrants, not students.

5. US tax payers don't need to pay for foreign students' education as they study in their own country before and these students also pay high tuition and fees in US which are great funding sources for US universities.
