I strongly support the Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees for the following reasons.

1. Countless companies in USA depend on these students to make effort on their products, especially in the industry field. These students contributed a lot and are a major supporting strength for these companies' survival and development.

2. USA needs these students. Actually, nearly most talented well-educated students all over the world are working in the USA to help make this country a better place. Nearly most of the "brains" are in this country, working day and night just to make more progress in the industry or science. It's indeed America and its citizen that will get the most benefit of it.

3. It will not be wise for the USA and its citizen to shut its door and block these "brains" to enter. Locking up the country will not help making it a great country. A great country welcome all the talented people with good will and shared prospect to work and unite together and make real progress which will help people's life get easier and better.
