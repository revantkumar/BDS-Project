Steven Stocklin If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? Do you people really hate America this much? Here's some reasons why this rule is a crock of shit!

*OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and

*OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

* The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned. Today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.

*There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.

* OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jo bs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

* The Obama Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent.

*The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. The GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.

*The proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination.

*The rule requires these organizations to set up mento ring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit.

* On a variety of measures, the foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers. Skilled-foreign-worker programs are causing an internal brain drain in the United States.
lace.

* In 2002, 14.5% of black science and engineering majors chose computer science, versus 11.5% for all Americans. But by 2012, because of declining job prospects, the share of black science majors choosing computer science fell to 9.8%.

*DHS, by defining a recent college grad as a student, takes both the worker and the employer out from under payroll taxes -- thus penalizing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds directly, and our elders indirectly.

* Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class.
