David Martin First of all, I dearly support the extension of STEM major OPT.

I don't understand why so many citizens talking about the companies hire cheap foreign labor. In my opinion, I never see any company hire cheap foreign labor in STEM fields. We are talking about highly educated guys and they should not be mistreated. 

These talented workers are working hard and contributing themselves to United States. People are talking about they could not find a job because of international students? I think they should have look at their working performance and ethics but not try to blame others.

We should welcome talented workers from all over the world as we should strive to contribute our best to this country.
