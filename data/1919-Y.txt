If this proposal failed, what got impacted most is not us students, but your companies! Anyway students will find a job no matter in America, Canada, England, or our own country. Finally we'll settle down. But for your companies who have large portion of employees from other countries, will lose potential technical, human resource immediately! 

Without human support, a company will steadily die out, cutting more positions and creating more un-employments. Allowing international students come and participate to the development of America will surely benefit all sides. Different culture and ideas will make the country prosper rather than degenerate.

International students are making huge contributions. Think it over before driving us out.
