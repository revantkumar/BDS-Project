This is the way to go. America has become a great country because of millions of bright immigrants. We do need more well educated foreign students to keep our country seating on the top of the world. I know there will be some native tech workers worry about their jobs. But remember, American companies have to hire American prior to foreigners. So, if we are same good as foreign workers, we win the jobs. On the other hand, those bright immigrants sometimes startup new companies which bring more job opportunities. This is a win-win deal. I absolutely support it.
