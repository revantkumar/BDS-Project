As a F-1 mechanical engineering master student who will graduate next May, I really concerns about the OPT time issue. I am currently working with my major professor in a research project about Life Cycle Analysis. Our initial research proposal is to develop a software tool for researchers in this field and it will take a long time. My advisor is planning to hire me after my graduation using the OPT opportunity, so that I can continue on this project after that. If the policy is going to change towards a shorter OPT time, my professor and I will need to find another way which is highly unlikely to exist for my case.
