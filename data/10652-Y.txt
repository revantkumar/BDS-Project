I strongly oppose STEM Extension rule. It is unfair to students from NON-STEM areas who put equal effort and money to get their degrees. They should be given equal opportunity as well. Either the H1 Cap should be increased or NON-STEM degree holders should also be given the same amount of time to try their luck for the lottery.
