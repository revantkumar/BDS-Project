I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in STEM area.
2. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
3. It's good for US citizens because as economy getting better, unemployment rate will goes down and more US citizens may have a job. 
4. Talented students who come to US to study deserves equal opportunity and more time to practice their skills after graduation.
