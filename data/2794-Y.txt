Henry Redcliff It's not the OPT students who "steal" Americans job. In the contrary, OPT attracts international students who contribute billions of dollars to the U.S. economy, which in turn gives a boost to the economy growth. More students improve the competency of the U.S. higher education, which can train American tech works with better skills, thus make sure that the U.S. in leading in the global technology competition. If there arent enough U.S. tech worker or the workers are falling behind compared to their counterpart in other developed countries, the U.S. economy will be hurt eventually, just like what has happened to the U.S. manufacturing industry. Please support OPT and give the U.S. a better chance in global competition.
