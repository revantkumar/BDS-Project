This is a disturbing proposal. I have held positions in Financial Services, Technology and Biotechnology. What I have found is a continuing trend to select non-citizens over citizens for positions within these industries. In addition, US companies are choosing to send jobs via "consultants" to various countries like China, Vietnam, India, Ukraine, etc. I will also note that those non-citizens, once embedded within a company, tend to select only those individuals who are from their own countries, to have spots on the teams they are involved in.

My question is what is wrong with you people? It's obvious you have never worked in the private sector, but do you not have friends, relatives or other contacts that do? Do you not see our super high unemployment rate (the true rate, not the modified version put out by our current administration). Do you not care about your fellow citizens? Are you really that unpatriotic to support non-citizens over citizens?

You need to do one primary thing. Establish laws that require employers to vet and select a US citizen for every job opening available. If there is just one qualified individual against a hundred non-citizens, the citizen should get the job. I realize the H1 visa process has this verbage somewhere within it, but it is not being adhered to. 

You folks need to fix this problem vs worrying about extending more opportunities to non-citizens. Get your act together.
