I strongly support extend 24 months STEM OPT rule.

(1) U.S. will suffer from tremendous financial loss failing to publish new extended one (24 months STEM OPT). U.S. education system receives over 12 billion USD per year on the tuition fee of over 400k STEM students. They choose to get advanced education from U.S. because of the best after-school training opportunity (17 months STEM OPT). If STEP OPT extension can not be provided in the future, large portion of STEM students would abandon their future plan to study in U.S. That is a huge impact on the current U.S. education ecosystem.

(2) 3 years OPT is necessary for STEM students to be trained as a qualified engineer/scientist. 12 month practical experience is way too short for a college graduate to be comfortable with their work. It will also benefit the company.

(3) What most important is STEM OPT will NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident. OPT/STEM OPT is for training as post-university education. It is not a long term working plan because they have to apply for new visa. Also, U.S. government has imposed many restrictions on STEM OPT students. For example, the total unemployed time during OPT cannot be longer than 90 days, they can only work for e-verified companies, which is a small portion of the job market. In this way, OPT extension should Not be blamed of taking jobs away for residents.
