Greetings,

I, Neel Gandhi, completely support this new rule of expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. In my personal opinion, this will not only give all those students a very important opportunity to expand their practical knowledge but also it will enable them to contribute towards the benefit of this grate nation. This rule can mark new beginnings for every student towards a better life.
