Hima Anonymous I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I really liked the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule and strongly believe that it will be helpful to thousands of highly motivated international students to contribute in american economy. 

By this rule, students in foreign countries will be inspired to come to USA for higher education.
