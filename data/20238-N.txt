It appears the Obama Administration is intent on making its own rules which in effect, places American citizens at a disadvantage when seeking employment as STEM type employees. Why is money being taken from Social Security and Medicare trust funds to pay for foreign workers in STEM professions. I keep hearing that the Social Security trust fund is going to run out of money. No funds from the Social Security trust fund or the Medicare trust fund should be used to keep foreign students in the United States.
