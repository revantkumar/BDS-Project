The LAST thing this country needs is more financial incentives for employers to hire foreigners to do jobs that should be going to American workers. Just like the H1B visas, this proposed rule is not in the best interest of American workers and will result in higher unemployment figures. It is a known fact that roughly half of current US college students with STEM degrees can not find work in their field due to ill conceived laws that give financial incentives to corporations for hiring foreign workers over US citizens. This program continues down that same road of corrupt crony capitalism and should be abandoned. 

How is this even an issue having to do with Homeland Security in the first place? Why is taxpayer money being used to benefit students of other countries instead of American students? OPT has currently removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds to pay for this outrageous handout that harms American workers. OPT has already denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013. This ill conceived program should not be expanded, it should be ENDED!
