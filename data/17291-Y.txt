I fully aupport this program.

The idea behind companies favoring foreign workers over American citizens is false. Firstly, it is more expensive for an employer in terms of time and money to hire a foreign worker, which puts American workers at a huge advantage.

I know had applied to many several IT companies, and even though I received several offers, I could not work because not one emplyer wanted to sponsor me. 

This program gives me an opportunity to apply practical training so I can gain experience in USA and apply that to my home country.

Companies that abuse this program are just a small percentage of those that benefit from STEM students. STEM students bring great talent into this country. Without foreign STEM students, there would not be advancement in technology. STEM students help increase this countrys economy. There are so many advantages.

DHS should look into companies that misuse this program and implement policies to prevent this. A small number of companies abusing the program DOES NOT MEAN we STEM students should not get the opportunity to apply practical training.
