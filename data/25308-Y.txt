This proposal put more oversight on the OPT program. It provides a great opportunity to the US STEM employees to work with the brilliant and hard-working international students. This will create a cooperative environment in the US corporations. The employer can also benefit from the diversified employees to generate more creative ideas and innovative solutions. 

This is a proposal benefit for US STEM workers, US companies, as well as the welcoming international students. 

Hope it becomes effective as soon as possible.
