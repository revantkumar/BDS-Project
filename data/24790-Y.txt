Strongly agree!
This new extension rule give student better chance to practice in turn to strength the knowledge they learn in university. Most of the STEM major need plenty of practice to cover the case that they can not learn from attending a lecture, such as how to work with teammate, how to communicate with customer, how to make use of their knowledge to solve actual problems. This extension give students a way to achieve this, which of course make studying in the U.S more attractive, benefit both international student and the university themselves.
