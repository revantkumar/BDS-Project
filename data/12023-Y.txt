I strongly support the proposal. 
1. US is a well developed and powerful country due to many reasons and one of them is that it emphasize diversity. Different culture, different people and different minds help the country to thrive. Just look at those Professors in the universities. Many of them are not originally US citizens but the opportunity for foreign students to learn and work here in US make it possible for them to continue to contribute to the country.
2. Some said that it increases competition. Well, I believe competition make young people become better and keep improving. If there is no competition, no one will work very hard.

To sum up, being able to gather intelligence from all over the world is a bless. Don't waste it.
