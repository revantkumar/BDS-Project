US is a smart country because it actively brings in the most talented people from all over the world. This can be achieved because the country has proper and fair rule for nonimmigrant students. STEM majors are undoubtedly the strongest productive forces for US in the next several generations. So the improving and expanding of OPT is quite essential in my view.
