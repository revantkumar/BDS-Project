I believe this is a great and very beneficial policy. 

Many Americans think that foreign students steal their jobs. Actually, when foreign students are looking for jobs, they face more difficulties. They need to find the employers who would like to sponsor their H1B visa, which means spending more for hiring lawyers and going through complicated process. If a foreign student and an American have same educational degree and other factors, employers of course want to hire the American not the foreign students. Some people argue that foreign students have a bigger market because employers can afford less payment for them. Actually, it is not the truth. According to research, employers pay the same for hiring a foreign student as hiring a American.Why under this circumstance, so many Americans still blame foreign students of "stealing" their jobs? The reason is that foreign students really work hard and are more competitive than Americans. If Americans want their jobs back, they should work harder, instead of blaming others because others work very hard. Foreign students' diligent work and attitude bring themselves the bright future. And they become high-quality work force in the market, which will improve productivity and economic growth.
