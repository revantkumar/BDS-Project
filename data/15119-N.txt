The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts 
to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States
from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages
and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. 
This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.

As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes
employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage.
Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.

Stop this at once and retrain our own citizens; not replace them !

Sincerely
