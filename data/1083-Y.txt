I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. On one side, US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. As you know, this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more opportunities to fulfill their potentials.

As for people who disagree with this proposed rule, in my opinion, most of them are afraid that international students are competitiors for their job positions. I think they do not have to worry about this. First, international students who receive the STEM degree can only apply for jobs related with STEM, so job positions in other fields like finance, medicine, politics etc. are still available for US citizens as before. Secondly, if people are anxious about the competitiveness brought by international students, why don't they spend more time to improve their own skills instead of wasting time leaving comments here? Tech companies will never hire you if you are not qualified regardless of your citizenship! Remember, only the strong survive!

Thank you.
