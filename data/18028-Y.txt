I actively support this new OPT extension proposal. I'm an international graduate student from China and will be working in the U.S. soon. It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win policy for the U.S. as well as foreign students.

As an international student, why we chose came to US to study, the most powerful motivation is STEM major has extension. Because if so, we could have more time to practice our knowledge learned from US university and increase our working experiences in America. The sure thing is we've paid high tuition to US university, and definitely US government should keep its promise and give us the working opportunities. It's unfair to us if US government cancel the OPT extension.

12-months if of course not enough for foreign students to gain enough work experience. For example, some school doesnt have CPT. And if students want to have an internship to get to know more about the industry, they would have used 3 month on internship. And after that, if they feel really interested in working in the industry in U.S. they would like to seek a full time position. Some companies spend a few month training fresh graduates, so it will only be a few months left for foreign students to contribute professional skills to the company, which is less worthwhile for the company. 

In addition, I believe U.S. employers will benefit from OPT extension, not only professional skills, but also absorb different culture from OPT students' countries. It's the best way to open international market because the earth is becoming smaller and smaller. This policy has more positive affects than negative one.
