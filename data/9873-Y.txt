I strongly support this new policy for the following reasons:
1) Students that graduated from STEM majors are those US economy is badly in need of. They can provide the essential skills that make the US economy more competitive in the world, and are also right now the most innovative part of US workforce. US economy needs these students to stay just like car needs gas, fish needs water, macaroni needs cheese. If the US government is insistent on sending those students back to where they came, the only consequence would be that they will add to their home country's (most likely China and India) technological innovation and economical competitiveness, after US education system has spent so much effort and resources on training them. 
2) The significance of impact created by the students with degrees on STEM majors on the US society is certainly conspicuous. It is from them that the CEO of some of the big name companies such as Google and Microsoft came.
