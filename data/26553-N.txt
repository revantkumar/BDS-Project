What good reason do you have for doing this? Everything I've read about this 'program' only harms the American working man and woman. 
How do you plan on keeping track of these 'students'? There is no way you can do that. 
We have millions of our own citizens trying desperately to find jobs and are unable to do that. The only ones to benefit from this, is large corporations. For shame on anyone who is for this.
In case you haven't heard, Social Security is already in trouble. What this program does it rob SS of even more money.
Again, for shame, for shame.
Many Americans, myself included, already feel we're strangers in our own country.
