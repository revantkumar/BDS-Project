Ananya Anonymous I am supporting this proposed revised OPT Extension rule. The time international students will receive with this rule will help them engaging their classroom lessons into the bigger practical scenario .The students can have the benefits of their time and hard work they put together during their studies in US. Also the companies will also get the benefits to retain these talents in their organization and can use the best of their knowledge to make the organization technically sound in every perspective. The fresh ideas from the graduate students will address the problem in new vision and will be beneficial for overall organization.
