I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule.
First, DHS believes that students participating in practical training in STEM fields should be encouraged to pursue meaningful projects that contribute to a deeper understanding of their field of study and help develop the practical skills necessary to advance their careers. I'm major in Electrical Engineering, and most of my projects after graduation need one year time to finish, some bigger and better projects need more than two years to finish, but I cannot choose any of them because of my OPT length. If the OPT extension are cancelled, the number of students in the U.S.A will reduce enormously. 

Second, the more internationals students in U.S.A, the better for the economy of this country.The tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion) is a big amount. And public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students. International students are the high-educated group in the states, they improve the quality of the community and low the criminal rates for foreigners.
