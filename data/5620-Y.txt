tina l Firstly, this rule will make academic sectors is US stand out of others from other countries. As an international student from China, the reason why I chose to study here in US was for this industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. Without this OPT extension rule, US academic sectors would be much less competitive and lose countless foreign STEM talents, who make huge contribution with their knowledge and talent to academic achievement in US.

Secondly, international students regularly contribute a significant amount of money into the US economy. This contribution includes both tuition and living expenses. From landlord of my apartment to market I always go shopping to, from university school shuttle to even my barber living in the community, we, international student bring a lot profit to community around us.

Thirdly, OPT extension if for E-verified company only. E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. Therefore, this rule is just applied for companies that would not discriminate candidates by their citizenship or race, no matter foreign students or not. It has nothing to do with the statement like 'let Americans lose job opportunity from foreign students'.
