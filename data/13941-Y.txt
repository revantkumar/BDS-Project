I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country so that they can make contributions to the U.S, since these students are very smart and have strong ability to do their contributions.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. If we could not make a extension, a lot of student must come back to their home, and diversity is no longer existing in U.S

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Actually, if more students are staying in U.S. to work, the native U.S. student could learn from them, and to make them better to win the competition. they will work harder, so this is a positive competition, which will make both of U.S. students and international students become better.
