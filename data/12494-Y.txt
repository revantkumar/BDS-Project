I strongly support the OPT extension program.

Firstly, highly-skilled immigrants have made great contributions to American economy. Most STEM OPT students are highly-skilled and employed in high-tech companies. Many people claim that STEM OPT takes away job opportunities from Americans, however that's not true. Highly-skilled STEM students help the US companies to be more competitive in the global market and expand their business and actually create more jobs. We all know that US companies have many restrictions in hiring foreigners, so they will definitely NOT hire OPT students if they can find suitable local candidates. If OPT extension is revoked, it will cause massive disruption to the high-tech companies in the US and eventually they may lose their market against the global competitors.

Secondly, OPT extension helps bring more international students to the US and they contribute tens of billions of dollars to US economy every year. Without OPT extension, US colleges will be less attractive to the international students.
