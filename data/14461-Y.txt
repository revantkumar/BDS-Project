I really support to pass this rule. Currently lots of technical foreign workers from STEM majors contribute their knowledge and amazing work to US high tech industries. It makes sense that they are worth to get a more stable working identity. By doing that, it will provide more benefits to the foreign workers, US high tech industry, and US high tech economy. Why today USA is so powerful is because USA is only country who welcomes foreign scientists and engineers. So I think this rule will definitely lead to a win-win situation.
