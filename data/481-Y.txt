You cannot simply keep your job buying getting rid of all the foreigners. YOU KEEP YOUR JOB BY ENSURING A BOOMING ECONOMY. 

The students who are going to get the extension are all from ScienceTechnologyEngineeringMathematics, they gained their knowledge from American universities, if they are not going to make any contributions for American, this is a great loss. Canceling the extension encourages a lot of these students to go back to their own countries. As we can learn from history. If there is a flow of a knowledge from one country to another, the money would follow the flow. American gained its power by attracting people with good education from all over the world. If the extension is canceled, these people will go back.

With globalization, if American companies cannot find the best employees, either they will be beaten by companies from other countries and get bankrupt, or they will seek to transfer their business overseas. None of these two situation is of any benefit to American citizens. And if the jobs go overseas, the American government just have no control on them. We all know that in countries such as India, you can hire employees with a much lower salary than in the United States. Since these companies are transferring, it becomes a better choice for them to just hire more people from overseas.

In conclusion, canceling the OPT extension is a really short-sighted decision. It will harm the economy of the United States in the long run!
