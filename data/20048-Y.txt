I strongly support this proposed rule, as an international student i came to knew that United States is land of opportunities where a student can gain more knowledge and experience a new world. By extending the OPT, student can gain more experience in the real world and many students get the chance to do their masters in US indeed their dream comes true. It is not only important for the non-immigrants but also the for the US government, it will increase the economy as well as in the IT sector. There are many international people in the good positions like CEO's of the Google, Microsoft etc they proved their talent.. if they didn't have that OPT how they would be in that position. So as we would like to prove our talent and make proud to the company as well as country am working in. Please give equal opportunities to the citizens and non-citizens of US. We believe that US is land of opportunities please don't make us to believe that it is wrong. I believe that this rule will pass and helps the students in their carrier and study. 

Thank you,
