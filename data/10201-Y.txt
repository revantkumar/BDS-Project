Hi I think the STEM extension should be there. It helps the students, companies as well as the US economy to advance. Because of so many students the competition becomes healthy and the result of which we have seen in the last decade where the technologies have advanced so much. Without this rule the students will not be able to get industry experience which will be a big blow to there careers .

I am in support of STEM extension.
