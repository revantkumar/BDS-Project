I really read the policy couple times.

I really can not find anything wrong with this.

At least, now every country wants to attract people from other country to consume and study, so that can let economics develops, and this policy can let more and more students consume in USA, what is more, they can be hired by low salary, and more students will go to USA to study.

So i think it is very good for the future of USA.
