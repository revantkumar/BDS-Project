I support the opt ext for F1 students to be increased to 24 months replacing the current 17 months.
The increase in duration of opt ext will be helpful for the students to have bright future in getting good employment opportunities in US and develop themselves as an IT professionalls.It will also help them to apply for the H1B visa process as they can apply 3 times in their duration of OPT.
