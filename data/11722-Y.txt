I strongly suggest to expand OPT for the following reasons:

1. Longer OPT will attract more international students to study in US, and that will increase the economy situation in US.

2. America should continue giving equal chance to everyone to find jobs. That will let more talent people work in companies.

3. America should be a muticultural country, and expanding OPT is a really good way to make this better.
