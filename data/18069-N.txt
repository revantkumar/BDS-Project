Hello, 

I have not been able to get a STEM job (I was a software engineer until 2001, and have a BS in COMputer Science!) since 2001 when my job was taken by an Indian who I TRAINED!! 

There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the United States with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree, INDLUDING ME!!!

There are about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties(ME!!!!), many of whom would return to those fields with appropriate incentives.

The OPT foreign workers will displace graduating Americans who are struggling to repay massive student loans (ME!!!).

By turning the F-1 student visas into 3-year work visas, DHS is doing an end run around Congressional limits on H-1b 3-year work visas.

There are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas, yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields.

Big Tech lobbyists have spent over $1 billion seeking immigration increases, but Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are laying off tens of thousands of employees.
