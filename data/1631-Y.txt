Competition and attraction of talented people make US the most competitive country in the technology field. US technology giants, e.g., Apple, Google, MS and FB, employ so many international employees because that makes them stronger in human resources. Nobody pays, forces or lobbies them to do that, it's their own choices for their own good. I understand the concerns regarding US citizens employments, but stop attracting talent people all around the world is definitely not the way US developed to a great country as it is today.
