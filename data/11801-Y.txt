I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S., a lot famous man was international students in the U.S.. And U.S. need more freshman to build the country.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. A lot of international students have high salary and their jobs do not fit the residents. Competition can help the U.S. have more talents and increase the average salary of all the persons, including local students and international students.
