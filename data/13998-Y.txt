I support this proposal. The extension of OPT program allows employers in the United States to retain more talented and dedicated STEM employees. Those intelligent and diligent foreign nationals create great value for their US employers and the science and technology advancement for the greater human being. Their talent and capabilities also contribute a lot to the US economy. The STEM workforce is in great need of qualified employees and F-1 students with STEM degrees can fill this needs. With the extension they could contribute to this workforce for a longer time, and bring more about what they have learned and experienced back to their home countries. Their home countries needs well educated and AND experienced STEM workers. And this professional expereience would need to come from OPT and associated extension.
