I would support OPT-extension as a employer in U.S. company. 

According to a recent report released by Bureau of Economic Analysis in 2014, science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) related industries like manufacturing, finance, professional services, and trading account for around 55% of the U.S. GDP. Obviously it is the comparative advantages in STEM human resources that make the U.S. be the greatest country in the world. Highly educated international students are great work force while few American people are willing to do those tedious jobs with medium payment. Take my company as an example. There are over 70% software engineers from other countries, like China, India, or Korea, while over 80% of recruiters do not have an American permanent residence. So those STEM students are making great contribution to our country. Extending the F1 students's serving time would benefit a lot to American people.
