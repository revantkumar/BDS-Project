I strongly SUPPORT new regulation for OPT STEM extension for the following reasons:

1. It's very beneficial for the US to let skilled foreign students contribute to the US society for three years after getting education at a US college

2. As an engineer, I know that 2 more years of working period is very important for a technical role. 1 year of work as a technical person in a company can't help contribute intellectually much, as great projects and ideas take time to be realized. If only given one year, it would be very difficult for any talented technical foreign student to contribute to the US.

3. Foreign students make up a big part of US college, which adds up to diversity to the US culture and help with the economy. Without an OPT extension, US colleges wouldn't be able to attract foreign students to get education in the US, which will hurt both culture diversity and make American citizens pay more for tuitions
