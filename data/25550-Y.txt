I believe hiring nonimmigrant students can help boost US economy. Take the company I currently work in as an example. We have three international students on OPT in our company. They are mainly helping with the international sales, which take up to almost 30% of total sales. In 2008 and 2009, our company struggled with crisis, and then we started to seek opportunities abroad. These opportunities eventually assisted us to survive the recession. Later we hired a few interns with international background to translate our product and marketing materials into different languages to expand the market. They also helped with the sales, and our customers were very happy. We realized how important it is to understand the language and cultural to do business. The three students on opt that we currently have all work full-time now. They help the company secure the business in Asia, Europe and Mexico, which stabilize our sales and performance. International sales take up a great amount of our current sales, and we cannot survive without these, without the help of the nonimmigrant students
