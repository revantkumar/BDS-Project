I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am an international graduate student from China, and currently a STEM PhD student. Before I came to the US, I obtained my master's degree in a top 1% university. I had multiple opportunities, such as furthering my PhD study study in the same school, or working in the National Academy of science. However, I finally chose to study in the US because I think it could provide me optimal education resources and research facilities. It also provides me the chance to get industry training experience, so that when I come back to China I can be more competitive compared with my peers.

I am just one of those international students who are attracted by the US education system and come here. What we bring along with us are our passion, knowledge and creativity. We have seen the success of many large companies such as Apple, Facebook and Amazon, which enroll thousands of STEM students every year. We also have played an important role in start-up companies. It is not exaggerating that we have indirectly affected the US's economy. 

However, under the current OPT program many talented students have to leave the US and give up their dreams. Just take myself for example, if I knew that I had little chance to stay here legally after graduation, I would prefer to go back to China immediately after graduation. By doing so I am able to better control my future career. However, if I do so, all the education investment spent on me during my five years PhD life could not be converted to benefit outputs in the US. As a result, I strong agree the OPT extension plan.
