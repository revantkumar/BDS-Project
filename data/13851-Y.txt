I strongly support this proposal, because of following reasons:
1. Till date, most of the people in tech industry in USA are either an immigrant or an foreign individual.
2. Contribution of these people is humongous and drives most of the prominent industry sectors in USA.
3. Rejection of this rule will hamper the US economy drastically as it is highly dependent on these talented skilled people
4. Criteria for employment should be set on the talent basis and not on an individual's citizenship
5. From US's employment perspective, I'm sure they are already at the beneficiary side in terms of salary, it's just the talent which can differentiate people-to-people in terms of a deserving jobs.

Best example: Elon Musk, Tesla CEO an exceptional and greatest entrepreneur is also an immigrant from South Africa.
