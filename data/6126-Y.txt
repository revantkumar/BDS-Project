1. OPT will benefit both American citizens and F1 students. F1 students have made significant contributions to the US. I am a PhD student in Agricultural and Biological Engineering Department at Purdue University. 50% of graduate students in our department are international students, who contribute themselves to the US by paying tuition, conduct research, publish papers and exchange culture.

2. Expanding OPT will attract more talents all around the world to US for education. Diversity is essential for high quality education in US. International students can provide new and brilliant ideas. 
3. Expanding OPT will provide more opportunity for F1 students to get H1B visa. This will benefit both students and companies, since project or program always needs at least two or three years to be completed. 
4. The companies can have enough time to find employees with more talents and abilities if this rule is approved. One year is too short to select am appropriate future employee.
The extension is a great idea. I look forward to hearing it in action.

Sincerely,
Tian Guo
