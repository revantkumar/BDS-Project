I STRONGLY SUPPORT the opt-extension. 

On one hand, foreign STEM tech workers contributed tremendous growth to the USA economy. However, as we know, a great part of these talented workers will lose their rights to continue working and contributing to their companies and to the USA economy due to the limited H1B Visa approval per year if there's no OPT extension. 

On the other hand, it will be a great loss to many tech companies in the US if their talented employees who are on OPT have to leave the country due to 12-month limitation of OPT. 

What's more, the US universities and research institutions will be more attractive to the foreign tech students with the opt-extension policy because in this way the students have more freedom and more opportunities to gain some working experience internationally and will be more competitive when they go back to their home countries. 

Therefore, I believe the policy of opt-extension can lead to a win-win result and it should be supported.
