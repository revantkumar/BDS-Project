I strongly support OPT extension. I think it needs to be extended to 36 months. 

I disagree that it takes away american workers job. I believe people with skills will definitely get the job and one should work hard on improving their skills rather than looking for the help. When the individuals perform better, The county as whole performs better so I believe we need to save the talent.
