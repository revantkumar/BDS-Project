I think OPT Extension is an important policy both for international students and US job market. We know that most of STEM related positions were filled by international students, which means US still couldn't offer enough employees for these positions by US cities selves. If international students from STEM major couldn't lengthen their OPT, most of international students will have to leave US, and US job market will face the difficulties in looking for enough employees to fit the positions. As time going, it will lead to a week competition of US companies in global market, end up with a slower growing up. In the other side, if international students do know it is almost hard to have work chances for more than one year in US, many students may choose not to study in US, rather choosing other North American countries or European countries, which is also will give out a bad affect to US. I am a student of a Master program in Computer science, I can see that more and more international students are thinking out going back to their country right after their graduation because of the no extension policies. And more and even more other country students don't want to come for the hard situation to stay for more years. So I believe that giving more chances to international students means giving the industry energy and future for US.
