Edward Forbosel I do understand the concern of some Americans of losing a job. But if one is as good as those foreign employees, speaks much better English, and is a American, he/she has nothing to worry about. The problem is that those people are not so smart, and do not work hard on practicing their skill sets, but only yell at others. I support this proposal because a strong economy does need skilled workers (especially in STEM) as much as possible. But now obviously we lack skilled workers.
