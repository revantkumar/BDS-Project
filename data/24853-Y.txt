I am currently holding H1 visa, strictly not a beneficiary from this rule. However, the previous 17 months STEM extension helped me a lot in pursuing my career. I would have been in homeland, working for unknown company, striving for living, worried about buying a house. Instead I am here, acquiring the most advanced technology, having a regular schedule, unafraid of diseases. Honestly, I planned going back, I readlly did, when I just graduated from school, and it occurred to me that I have my family to take care, I can listen and speak language that I understand, or get to a position in a sordid way which is out of rules. But all those thoughts vanished, when my parents spoke to me, do whatever you think is right, be the one you want to be.

So I stayed, not even an intension to take any jobs from US citizens, just want to know what I am capable of. Maybe, someday I will go back to reunion with my family, but before that, I need to work hard for my dream.

Having viewed most comments under this post of rule, I am very disappointed to see a lot objections against this decision. If I get it right, some people, even Phd students, consider this rule as a threat to take away job opportunities. Then try answer few of my concerns:
1. If OPT extension is not necessary, why should these companies be e-verified? (e.g. Google, FB)
2. How many times can a graduated student apply for H1 with OPT extension? without?
3. How about the contributions made by these people working under OPT? Is there enough US citizens to replace them? If so, how about the average quality?
4. Are these companies hiring unstable OPT workers while they having better local candidates?
5. Are these objectors really think OPT workers are taking their jobs, or they are actually worried about lacking in competence?
6. If no OPT extension is allowed, when most of these graduated students go back and make their own countries thrive, what kind of threats will bring to United States in a global scope?

Thanks.
