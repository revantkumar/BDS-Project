Not only do I not support the extension, I do not support the program. I scanned through the first few pages of comments and found no names that appeared to be that of US citizens. I formally request that all comments from non US born students enrolled in the program be dismissed from comment. Of course they want to stay and study longer.

How many of the terrorists that have attacked us came here to study? What is the added revenue to our state and private schools directly from the students studying from other countries? How many of the students that came here to study actually stay here and work? How many students receive discounted tuition? How much is the total discounted tuition for students from other countries compared to those of US born students per student? How many of these students come here with their Visas and then never leave, and get lost in our "system"?

If a student wishes to come here to study, I would propose that they have a US citizen sponsor them and be held responsible for their whereabouts and actions, similar to that found in todays high school exchange programs. I would further propose that the students that come here equal the students that go to their country. We, the US can not be everything to everyone.
