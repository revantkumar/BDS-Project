I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

Firstly, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities and stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

Secondly, diversity is very important for the U.S, many foreign people have made great achievements in the United States. The government should keep these outstanding talents.

Thirdly, high-tech companies need more and more technical people to move forward. If they lose many talents, it will affect U.S. economic development.
