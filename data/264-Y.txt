As a HR in Qualcomm, Definitely, I agree with the decision to improve the training opportunities for F1 Non-immigrant students with STEM degrees. 

It is extremely hard to find proper entry level candidates with US citizenship. Compared with candidates with US citizenship, international students have better performance, from my perspective of view. And having them being hired actually increased technology strength of US. 

So, voiding the OPT extension will add burden to our work.
