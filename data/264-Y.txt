Ray Wu I definitely support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international student. My major is mechanical Engineering. The point that I came to study here is because US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension plays an important role in attracting foreign STEM talents. Without it, very few foreign STEM talents will come contribute their knowledge to this country every year.For instance, I probably would choose to study in Canada. As you all know, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's dramatically a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are operated by foreign STEM talents, like Sundar Pichai,Satya Nadella,Shantanu Narayen.

Based on my previous work experience, most large R&D projects should last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.

As an international student, I would return back my own country eventually. Before that, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.

US will benefit from international talents! You can see it!
