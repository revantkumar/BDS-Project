I am writing to support the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule expanding the Optional Practical Training program. 

International students are really important to the US. The US needs to keep attracting the smartest people in the world. Many smart people choose to study at the US rather than other countries because they are allowed to work for 29 months here. Many F-1 students are already working at companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Uber, Airbnb and Amazon. If the OPT extension is cancelled, hundreds of thousands of them will have to go back to their countries, which is quite a big loss for those companies and the economy of the US. Furthermore, less and less smart people will come to the US to make contributions because they will only have 12 months to work.

I also think cancelling the OPT extension will do harm to the job opportunities of American people. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Microsoft are always trying to seek the smartest people in the world. If these smart people have to go back to their countries, those companies will choose to open offices outside the US to make sure that they can hire the people they want. As a result, job opportunities for people of our country will be less. 

To conclude, I believe the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule expanding the Optional Practical Training program will benefit both American people and international students.
