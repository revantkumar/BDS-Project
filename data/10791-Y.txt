I strongly give thumbs up for the proposed rule.

1) The spirit of American dream is equal opportunity. Everyone has equal chance to success. That is why U.S attracts so many foreign talented students who are willing to work in U.S. after their graduation. They in turn contribute enormously to American economy especially in high-tech aspects. Extending OPT will offer more time for foreign students to polish their skills and better serve the community and country.

2) Every STEM student hired by American company is because of nothing but his/her outstanding and/or unique knowledge or skill. They are complement not competitors in the job markets. So it makes no sense that extending OPT will take away American job opportunity. Rather it will boost American economy and create more job opportunities potentially. 

3) Extending OPT is a very practical rule for U.S companies to keep high-tech intelligence. Due to the quota of H-1 working visa, a lot of students cannot work in U.S. anymore after one year if they are not selected in the very competitive H-1 visa lottery. It is an extra cost for employers, and hinders the company efficiency and competency improvement.
