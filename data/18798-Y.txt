I support this rule. I think the International student get educated in the United States. They are provided same resources as native American students in college. They have American dreams and want to make contribution to the United States after graudation. It doesn't make sense that the United States just provide a variety of resources and let them leave. I believe American is a place for everyone who has a dream. This is a place where dreams become true.
