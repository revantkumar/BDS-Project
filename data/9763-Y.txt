This is a great news for U.S. universities. International students have always been an important part of our campus and we've been benefiting greatly from the dedicating work and tuition coming from them since 2008.

With this new regulation being passed, I'm sure we would be able to attract more capable students all over the world. This would surely make U.S. institutes much competitive against other countries.
