Ed Freier The proposed rule by DHS to expand the OPT program just seems like another avenue for U.S. companies to abuse the system. Why are American citizen college students not afforded the same opportunity. Many receive their degrees and still cannot find work because a cheaper foreign worker has OPT. Why do you value foreign workers over American workers. I strongly disagree with this DHS proposal.
