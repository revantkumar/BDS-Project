I strongly believe this rule has to be brought into force for a number of reasons.

- The 24 months extension would promote more international students to pursue their masters in US . Hence a lot of monetary inflow for the United States considering the international fees is twice the state fee.

- With America being the leading nation and having a powerful currency against most of the other countries, students who come to study have ridiculously high loans to repay! With no extension chances of repayment within a year are very less. Hence students would stop coming to United States and would prefer other countries which could be a huge loss for the Country!

-Majority of the students who come to United states are for masters which means brain drain from developing nations! Why would someone be foolish enough to stop highly educated brains who come to improve the economy of the States!
