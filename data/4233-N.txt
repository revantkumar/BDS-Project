Please stop the expansion of the OPT program. This provides incentives for greedy corporations to hire foreign workers over american workers by exempting them from paying payroll taxes and not requiring them to be paid the prevailing wage. We have over 90 million people out of work here in this country - Immigration policy in america should put the interests of american workers FIRST, not greedy corporate donors and lobbyists.
