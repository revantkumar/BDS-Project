Lanny Curry The OPT program gives industry a direct monetary incentive to hire graduating immigrants over graduating US citizens. Why in the world would the US have a program that keeps graduating citizens from being hired in their high tech field of study? Some supporters of the OPT program proposals incorrectly think we don't have enough graduates to fill high tech jobs. But that is not true. At least take the monetary incentives away from hiring an immigrant and allow US citizens to be hired first, then see how many immigrants are hired and you will see the true need for additional workers for high tech jobs. As it is proposed, the OPT program will effectively penalize industry for hiring a US citizen by making it cheaper to hire a graduating immigrant. This in turn penalizes the US citizens that choose a high tech undergraduate study program and may even influence some students to study something other than high tech. In the long run, this will penalize high tech industry and the United States as a whole. Please do not expand the OPT program.
