Yuzhong Li It's really a good news for both International STEM student and the US if this proposal can be released. International STEM students are those most talented ones coming from different countries all around the world. With OPT extension, many of these people would devote their best years working for the US instead of their home countries. They can make a big difference working for the US high-tech companies. And at the same time, it's also a valuable experience for themselves once they went back home. It's an absolutely win-win situation. In STEM industry, one year is right a golden time when new hires are going to output value to their companies after getting familiar with complicated systems and work flows. If there is no extension, it will be an awkward situation for both STEM students and their companies.
