As an international student, I strongly support OPT extension. OPT brings me a lot of experience no matter on physically or mentally. It allows me to experience about living in the US, which open my mind, extend my views. It is so much positive. OPT extension brings me too much invaluable experience. 

As we know, the US has different people from all around the world with different religions, different races. International STEM students deserve to have this extension for their hard study and hard working. People living the US also need to be kind to others from other countries. Because we are all from earth and we are a big family.
