Let's just assume what will happen if this regulation gets rejected again: with shorter time span and higher demand, the possibility of getting a H1b from the current lottery system will become smaller and smaller. There is no doubt that the employers will hire less international student because the employers don't want to train them and pay them in vain if they have to leave the country a year after. So most talented international students will just get educated and then go back to build their own country. What America will have is just the tuition the students paid, without the knowledge they have learned or sparks they have gotten.

If that is the amount of money America wants to make and the future America wants to have, I have to say, "smart choice".
