I strongly support this rule because of many reasons. Firstly many countries does not allow OPT like in USA because of which many students come to this country for higher studies. Because of this revenue is increased by the amount of taxes they pay on their employment. Also because of the skilled immigrants there is a lot of innovation which is leading to many new jobs. This is beneficial to both the residents and the foreign workers. Based on these advantages the OPT has to extended which is benefiting both the parties.
