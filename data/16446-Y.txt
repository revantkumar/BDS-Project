I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The extension could help U.S.A recruit more talents since that more time means bigger chance for F-1 students to find a suitable job to apply their professional knowledge learned in Universities. 

2. The extension could energize the talents market in America. Though the competition does exist, this policy can definitely promote the average performance of talents. 

3. We need to understand that the OPT does not take opportunities from U.S. citizens at all. And extension of OPT just means that F-1 students gets more time to look for a suitable job. If they are qualified, they will be hired. If not, they will not be hired no matter how the OPT policy changes.
