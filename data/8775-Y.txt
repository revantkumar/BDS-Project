Generally this proposal is great and going to improve the value of education programs for international students and I am supporting this proposal. As far as I am concerned, international students admitted by US top universities are usually competent and can make great contribution to the economy. Compared with the old STEM OPT extension of 17 months, 24 months of OPT extension enables students in those STEM specializations, which are badly needed by domestic companies and institutions, to apply for their H1B visas for three times, thus increase the probability to win the lottery given the situation the total H1B visas per year is very limited. So, this is generally an improvement to the current policy.

However, without increasing the totally annually number of H1B visas as well as reducing the abuse of fake and duplicated applications made by Indian consulting companies, the effect of this proposal will be limited. There is urgent need to make the application process of H1B visas fair to all international students.
