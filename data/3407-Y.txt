I strongly support the proposed extension program.

Firstly, such a program will not automatically guarantee a job for an international student, but only a chance that international students are eligible to work for a short period of time. This is quite important that the american employers, such as high tech companies, can hire the most competent employees who will contribute to the technology innovation and economic prosperity in US. Compared with international students, the competent US students are much more likely to get a satisfactory job, since, as native English speakers, they have much better communication skills. Only a very small portion of international students who are really hard working and talented can get a job here in US, through the OPT program.

Secondly, assumed that the american employers were not allowed to hire international students any more, which of course, would deeply hurt the US economy, especially the high tech companies, the employers would still not hire any incompetent workers to waste time and money, rather, they would turn to hire short-term cheaper and competent international workers with much lower wage, through L visa or ICC program. These workers do not have American degrees and hence are legally allowed to pay less. This is real nightmare for American workers! Not the OPT program.
