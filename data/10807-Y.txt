When a group of people with better skills come to your land, you are not happy to accept them. What are you afraid? Why are you afraid? It is because you are lacking of confidence! You know you are not competent with them, since they graduate from American colleges and graduate schools, and they spent way much more time than you to survive in a different country. If you are smart and hardworking enough, you ought to like to work with the same talented people, rather than complaining about them. Thus fellow Americans, please abandon your narrow mind and starting working hard. Don't be a coward and beat them up.

Dear American government, please keep this highly educated aliens in the country. They will be an excellent inspiration for our people to work harder and be more creative. We should live in fear instead of harmony. We can be sheep, but we definitely need to keep wolves around us. Otherwise, many people will become completely useless.

I would also provide another view. I don't have too much concern about OPT extension because the students are skillful, and they have contribute thousands of dollars as their tuition and living expense to this country. Why do way just see them as a threat rather than a contributor? 

I would worry more about the ones with H1B visa who is directly hired from abroad. They haven't contribute even one penny to this country! Are they truly better than US citizens? or even the students under OPT? At least the students under OPT are trained in our US colleges where education quality is guaranteed. Why do we spend nearly half of H1B quota on abroad workers especially India? If I can find an excuse for OPT extension, I have no idea why we hire foreigners abroad.
