I highly support the 24 month OPT extension proposal. 
I am a new employee in my company as a test engineer. Two months of training has let me understand that two years are the basic time limit for a new worker to be able to work on a peoject independently, considering the complexity of different types of product (inverter testing area is my field) and the accurate application of the safety standards from different countries. 
It will certainly be a loss of I have to leave my job due to the loss of my status, let alone I am not the only international employee hired by my company. Please consider this situation not only from the point of view of international individuals, but also from the point of view of the technical companies which bring investments to US, and help improve the ethnic balance in society which makes US the land os freedom.
