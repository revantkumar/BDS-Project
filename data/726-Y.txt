I strongly support this proposal of extending OPT STEM to 24 months. 

I browsed some others' comments before I made this one. Many of opposite comments make little sense, they are saying like:

1) F1 students will steal jobs from 'hard working Americans'. No matter how many people are supporting this, this is not true. we are talking about tech jobs, and apparently these objection guys have little information (of course they don't want to know) of the recruiting market in tech companies. They seems don't understand how hard for a company to hire a qualified 'hard working American' STEM worker even if if definitely prefer US citizens. And this is because U.S citizens mostly are not fond of STEM fields.

2) F1 workers lowered the average wage. This is not true as well, we are not talking about disk washing, door keeping job or other short-term jobs. STEM company typically has to be fair and pay same money as US citizens because the company needs them to work long even after they got H-1B.

3) Americans are paying for F1 students. This is ridiculous, I don't know what extra thing they paid, or they just don't know F1 workers need to pay tax as well. 

4) This rule benefits the 'big companies'. This is true but what's the problem? Are 'big companies' evil that are snitching money from people? Aren't people using services and products from big company? Without enough proficient STEM workers, how can people enjoy these things?

5) They shouldn't work because they are foreigners! I won't comment much for this naive Chauvinism. These people should learn some history to know how current great America was built.

Overall speaking, the companies need STEM students so they can have enough workers to make great things. And STEM students like to work and they work hard. They are helping US to be superior in tech fields, For the guys who know little about STEM or even don't know what you are opposing, save you time and your comments with only rage should not count.
