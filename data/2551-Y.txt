The last student in my lab continued working for three more years after his graduation until his paper got published recently. Now he is leaving U.S. with great satisfaction since with this paper he would be able to get a decent faculty position in China. To a lot of foreign PhD students here in U.S, OPT extension is not for competition for job opportunities, but for an academic completeness.
