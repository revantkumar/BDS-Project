Jack Zwling I strongly support this rule to extend OPT extension to 24 months. It is good for American high-tech companies. It gives them an opportunity to make internationals offer what they learned first for US companies before they leave this country.

When putting international students to work, it usually takes some time for adapting themselves to work environment, just like US students; then they could begin to write code, build model or do research. After that, companies need time to exam their work, whether it lasts long or if the results stable. If not, they need to change and improve their works. When this step is done, companies need to figure out a way to use it make money, which would be necessary have the original author involved for more ideas.

Therefore, it should take about 2 to 3 years for those internationals make money for US companies. OPT extension for 24 months perfect fits it.
