We are a nation of Immigrants. International students who are in the STEM fields should be able to work for any company wiithout worrying about the H1B as the competetion is so high for outside of US. They should not be denied the opportunity to perform, excel, innovate and in turn contribute to the economy. They should be allowed to work atleast for 3 years as they spend humungous amounts of money on their higher education. We as a nation should facilitate the people who empowers the economy. However care has to be taken to ensure that it is not being exploited. There are lot of low quality institutions which claim themselves to be universities which does not have even a GRE requirement. So careful scrutiny should be done on each application of the individual as to where the degree belongs to . There were some fake like institutions which provide easy admissions to International students without strong background in their fields. First of all careful scrutiny should be done at granting F1 visa. Because they do not contribute to the economy. They rather spoil another good students chance of getting H1B visa.

Summarizing I totally support the rule. But careful scrutiny is needed that this is not being exploited.
