Please DO NOT extend this. If anything, it should be shortened. The rules that are part of this program require organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT, yet there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit. WHY? Americans are losing jobs to foreign workers in ever increasing numbers. This is just another way for American companies to hire cheap, foreign labor and kick American workers to the curb. With the H-1B visa program, the OPT program, and others, we are slowly replacing our American workforce in science and technology jobs with foreign workers for no other reason than companies can hire foreigners at lower wages. And yes, this is happening regardless of the "protections" that are meant to prevent it.
ENOUGH is enough ! It is bad enough greedy American corporations such as Walt Disney, Southern California Edison, SunTrust and many others are firing Americans and replacing them with foreign workers, but the U.S. government should not be aiding and abetting in this shameful practice. If anything, the U.S. government should be making sure that equally educated and qualified Americas are hired first, as well as prohibiting American companies from REPLACING American workers with foreign workers for the disgraceful reason of saving money and increase profits.
