I strongly agree the extension of OPT to 24 months. And my reasons are given below.

1. The extension of OPT to 24 moths do help to enhance the diversity of US companies. When US companies hire international students, the diversity culture will be enhanced. New international comers mean more communications with work mates. This help US companies open their mind and diverse the company culture.

2. The extension of OPT is good for US companies to compete with other country's companies. We know that there are a lot of international companies in the world wide. Those companies want to sell their products in abroad. If US companies have international students, it is useful for them to know the market and enhance the competition. 

3. The extension of OPT will contribute to the tax income of US government. When US companies hire international employees, they will give part of their salary to the US government, the states where they live in and the local cities. 

with the deprivation of OPT extension, the previous three advantages will not be gained. US will lost a great amount of high educated people and this will make supper negative effect on the development of US.
