I support OPT 24 month extension. For those who claim foreign students will take away our jobs I want to say YOU ARE WORNG! Please be advised that we are trying to let STEM student to stay, that mean Science, Technology, Engineering and Math! Let us keep smart people who want to stay to make contributions! A high-tech position will help to create lots of other surrounding positions! and Americans can take advantage of those positions.
