Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a December 2014 graduate of Stony Brook University with a STEM degree in Materials Engineering. I am currently working on 12 month OPT program. The recent court decision on cancellation of 17 month STEM OPT extension has caused a lot of distress to me and tens of thousands of other students on OPT. 

My employer had planned to apply for my H1B visa on April 2016 since I had the option of 17 months STEM OPT extension after the initial 12 month OPT. My employer would have definitely applied for H1B in April 2015 had we known STEM OPT extension was going to be cancelled and I actually had only 12 months OPT. The ruling is so sudden and unfair and it has left thousands of students like me with no other option but to leave the country on February 2016 if a new STEM extension rule is not implemented by then. 

International students with STEM degrees add great value to the United States workforce especially in the technical fields. I was glad to see the DHS had proposed a new rule which will allow STEM graduates to apply for a 24 month OPT extension. I urge the government to implement the new proposed 24 month STEM OPT extension as it will hugely benefit both the United States economy and provide STEM students the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in their specific technical fields for an additional 24 months.

Regards,
Ashwin Karpur Bhaskar
