Strongly support this new rule! Both the technology and economics of America cannot take such a huge risk to push the foreign talents away! Imaging what happens in Europe now. The open air of America makes what America is now. This rule will not hurt the citizens who have true talent. And it is the value we create and the tax we pay that make more American citizens live better. Think about it you citizens. Look further and you will see it is a win-win rule.
