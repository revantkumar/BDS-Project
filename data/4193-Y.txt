I strongly support this OPT-extension rule for the following reasons.

1. International employees contribute a lot in US tech industries. Without an OPT ext rule, most of these employees will work in their companies for only one year and leave employers lots of incomplete work. This will negatively affect the stability of these tech companies as it takes a long time to take over an unfamiliar project. The ext rule will allow international employees to work for a longer time in a company and create a win-win situation for both companies and employees, which in turn brings US government more tax revenue and benefits each US citizens.

2. US universities also benefit from OPT rules. The majority of international students are self-funded and pay more tuition than native students. This is a big income for universities. As this OPT ext rule can attract more international students to pursue further study in the US, the increasing tuision income will create more opportunies for native students to win a scholarship to support their study.

3. This proposed rule wont affect citizens' employment at all. In fact, US companies prefer to hire citizens over international students because they dont have to afford the sposor for international students. It's much more difficult for an international student to find a job than citizens.
