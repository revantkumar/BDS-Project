Yes, I totally agree with proposal. As foreign students, we need that to work legally in United States before we get H1B visa. Meanwhile, H1B visa is not easy to get and many company cannot or would not want to afford that. As a immigrant country, United States should be more friendly to foreign students, we can make many contributions to the country. My major is Computer Science, as i know, most American don't like and don't want to do IT related works. In Bay area, most Indian and Chinese work there as software engineer, which is very important to Bay area, and Bay area is very important to California and to United States. 

I really want this proposal can be approved. I would appreciate a lot.
