I HIGHLY SUPPORT the OPT extension regulation!!! As a US citizen, I do see how this regulation benefit USA and US citizen. I rent an apartment to two international students who graduated from college and is currently under OPT and work for US company. If they do not have the OPT extension they will have to leave US and I will loss the renting income. So I think the international students do have a lot of good impact for US economy. They pay their rent for US citizen. buy food from our supermarket, buy car from dealership, and fill their car in the gas station. They make a lot of consumption in the US, which is very good for US economy. And they create a lot of job opportunity too. Without the international students who work in the US under OPT, I will loss a large portion of money because of the rent. So I SUPPORT the OPT extension regulation.

In addition, I think the international students do make contribution for the US company. They work much harder than many US native workers and bring a lot of productivity and creativity into US companies, which is definitely good for companies. I always see the international students who rent my apartment work very late in their company and do very well for their jobs. That is another way to increase US economy and the competitiveness of US companies.

Overall, the OPT extension is very good for USA. So please approve the regulation. It will benefit USA tremendously!
