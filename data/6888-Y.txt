I strongly support the extension of OPT, especially STEM major students. Those F1 students have completed at least bachelor's degree, many of them also hold more advanced degrees after they receive the highest standard, competitive education and training in the US, it will definitely benefit the US economy with such high tech workers, to continuously support US as the high-tech leader in the world. I have full confidence of the quality of education and training of the US higher education system. It will be a huge loss that our system has produced so many high quality students, and, if the extension of F1 OPT was denied, that those high quality students produced by our system have to leave US and work for our competitors. Therefore, the extension of F1 opt is definitely a must.
