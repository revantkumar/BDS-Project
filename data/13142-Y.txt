I strongly support this rule for the following reasons: 
1.American advocate the importance of equality. Every student who received education in the US should have a fairly equal right to work in the US.
2. It is helpful for US technology-based companies (IT, statistics, engineering...) to increase its revenue by hiring talented foreign students.
3. Longer OPT allows foreign students to actually apply their knowledge from the US's schools into practice and earn useful and practical experience from the US society.
4. It will also attract foreign student to have higher education in the US and eventually is good for the US's education.
