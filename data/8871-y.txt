Mark Carter I am a senior college student. I support OPT extension for students with STEM degrees.
I enjoy studying with international students. I have some friends who are international students. Most of them are very smart. They work hard and I have to work hard, or I will fall behind. They are nice and generous to help me in assignments and projects. It is much better than high school. Some of my classmates will laugh at the one who spends much time in study. If OPT extension fails, I don't think USA is appealing to them. Maybe prospective students will choose another country to study. That means USA will lose talents.
I don't think international students will make pressure to citizens. Many companies don't hire international students. Only those companies which need a lot of STEM students and lack of citizens candidates are willing to hire international students. It is not easy for international students to find a job. If OPT fails, those companies which hire international students will get stuck. I don't think we can benefit from this.
So, why don't pass OPT extension and maintain these skilled talents for USA.
I support OPT extension for STEM students!
