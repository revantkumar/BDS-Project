I completely support the OPT extension from 17 months to 24 months. It will give adequate time for the students to utilize the skills acquired through STEM programs. I noticed there have been several negative reviews creating disgrace to the international students. There always exist a good and a bad thing behind any proposal just like a coin with two sides and its not imperative that all the International students do fraud/misuse the rule. 

It is the major responsibility of the Employers to thoroughly go through an interview process and identify a potential candidate. No foreign student goes to the employer and compel them to provide a job showing the fake resume. If a student provides fake experience, they suffer a lot to work up to the expectations and the employers have the freedom to fire the candidate as well. There are certain Employers I have come across who do a great background verification. It will solve any issues which were addressed by some people opposing the STEM extension. 

Considering few issues and blaming all the international students will definitely create a roadblock for prosperity and growth of students as well as the US Economy. There are many talented international students who can create wonders with high standard education provided by the US Universities. 

I really appreciate the DHS for such an initiative and hope students get benefited by the 24 month stem extension.
