I STRONGLY RECOMMEND the STEM OPT 24 months Extension. It would be better if the extension could be 48 months.

US market needs international graduated students badly in STEM majors, especially with degrees got in US. But the current H1b lottery selection could not fit the need for employers, LESS THAN 1/3 of candidates are selected. On the other hand, H1b opportunities are mostly taken by the ones who don't have degrees from US. Once passed, proper candidates could have enough time to stay and work in US. Companies don't need to spend more money, time or patience on employees' visa status. International STEM students are well-educated, they all have at least Master's degree. What's more, they have lived in US for more than 2 years, they can involve in US culture and society very easily. They can bring diversity, too. 

That's why I STRONGLY RECOMMEND the STEM OPT 24 months Extension.

Thanks.
