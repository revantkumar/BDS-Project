Grace Liu I approve of the stem extension. My major is financial mathematics(master degree), which belongs to applied mathematics. In my class, more than 90% are international student. According to what I know, there are lots of program attended mostly by international students. So the tuition fee is a large amount, which is beneficial to American education institution. And the extension of stem would encourage more international students.

Besides, what we do in United States is in labour intensive industry, something technique job like computer science, statistics and big data. Such industry need large amount of labor to make the improvement. So international student is valuable in some way. As for the immigration, most of international students don't want to stay in America for life long --- they just come to the United States to make several years contribution to the economy and technology, then come bake home, it's not a bad thing for America.
