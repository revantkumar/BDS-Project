I am strongly against this Proposal. We as a Nation should always protect our own citizens first, and keep the best jobs to our own people. Why handing the jobs to foreigners and allow them to steal our job opportunities? There are plenty of qualifying people from our own nation to do those technology jobs, allowing those foreigner to work and train 1 year from the big company can already potentially give them chances to steal the best operations and technology, and millions of jobs. We have been so nice and already opened doors to so much foreigners for our universities, give them the best educations in the world, now we are going to allow them to work and steal our jobs too? I don't think so, and it is very unfair to our hard working citizens, the government should be siding with our own people and protect our jobs.
