I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contribution to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. So many distinguished people who had great achievement in U.S. were international student of U.S. universities.

3. Competition always exists, but it is not a bad thing. The international students do not threaten the job opportunities that are generally fit for U.S. citizens, they only work in the field that strongly lacks talents. Also, competition helps the U.S. to get more talented peoples, to increase the average knowledge level, to better increase the global competitiveness of the U.S..
