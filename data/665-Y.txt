The reason why US remains strong is because it could and it still can attract the most brilliant minds all over the world to come to study here. From applying to graduate school, to taking all kinds of exams, as well as overcoming all kinds of difficulties until we get the degrees, we international students are competing with those own the citizenship fairly. I don't think we are taking away some people's job, since we are still competing fairly in the job market. Unlike other majors, I think STEM majors normally need the most brilliant minds to work in the fields. So in this case, who ever is the most capable should get the job, otherwise, the future of science and technology of US will fall behind other countries say China and India, if those smart people don't have a chance to stay.
