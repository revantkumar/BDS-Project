Betty Flowers We are against anything that encourages the crossing of the border illegally, and anything that advances the (tax free) work time after grad school of foreign countries.

We love our country and the Biblical standards it was founded on. We love the Bible and it is the Holy Inspired Word of God...every single word of it. We love the US flag and all that it represents. We have no problem with legal immigration and welcome anyone from outside the US who honestly seeks to come into the US and better their lives by legally seeking to do that. but it is totally wrong to allow illegal immigrants to come into our country, work at jobs (or sit at home and do nothing, send money back to their homeland, pay no taxes here and benefit from our Welfare/Social Services Programs, Social Security, etc. This takes jobs, wages and qualified benefits from our own people.

It is also wrong for our country to aid and send billions of dollars to foreign countries while we have people starving and living in total poverty in our own country, many living under bridges and any other dry place they can find to sleep. Charity begins at home and we are guilty of supporting too many countries with feebies when our own people need help as badly as they do. Outreach ministries can only do so much 'reaching out.' Those who are doing the most 'reaching out' have homes and families to support, too!
