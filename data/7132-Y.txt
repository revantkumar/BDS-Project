Anjia Wang I definitely support OPT extension policy.
It just acts like a trial for both foreign students and domestic companies. With this policy, companies have more opportunities to find more suitable employees and help build a better and better American. Meanwhile international students can build a better career path for themselves. 
And isn't it the sprit of America? Everyone who has a dream has right to make it come true with honest, courage and diligence. The reason why US becomes such a wonderful country is not it's only open to the so-called best human, it's because it's always open to everyone who has a dream, who is willing to build a better life by own hands and hard-working. Someone may say job offer is too limited to make everyone has a spot. It should be reserved for local students. My opinion is that you cannot protect someone or some companies by just forcibly wiping others out. Instead, competition will make all people try their best. Besides, comparing to international students, local ones already have advantages in language, social circles and sometimes more advanced pre-educations. Not mention that if you careful check the career event bulletin in the university, most of companies only have positions to citizens and permanent visa keeper. In my case, in end of September I went to career fair in Michigan Tech Uni, only about one fifth or even less Computer Science related job or intern positions are open to F1 students. But citizens and permanent visa keepers can choose from all positions. In this situation, how can F1 students can occupy too many spots?
Technology is moving forward unbelievably fast in US. It needs numerous people to contribute their knowledge. There won't be too much talented youths, never, especially in STEM degrees. We all remember decades years ago, America used to say no to Asians, to African Americans, it didn't do any good to anyone. Let's not do the wrong decision again.
