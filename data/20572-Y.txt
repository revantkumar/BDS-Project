I strongly support the proposal of keep expanding OPT for STEM students. 
1. As an F-1 international students, I just want to train my self more in job seeking in USA. No harm can be caused when compete with US residents. Most company has their plan in ratio of recruiting international student upon each year recruiting. So whether expanding or not does not change too much for US residents job seeking. This is a beneficial regulation for both students and US society. For international student, extension help get more experience and opportunities; for US society, companies have more chance in finding more excellent fit employees. 
2. 24 month for student to seek a ideal job is too short. Amount of recruiting international students is very limited. So competition among F1 student, rather than among F1 and Residents, is very competitive. It is advisable to extend the length of visa for graduated F1 student.
3. Diversity is what makes US a leader in the world. And constitution of international students among employees are very important. Government should offer more positive regulation on encouraging international student to find job in US.
