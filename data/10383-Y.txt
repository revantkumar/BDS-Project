I definitely support the proposal. It is very unfair that we international students pay much more tuition than American people in school but do not have the right to work in US after graduation. Employers will have bias to choose employees who are international students. Therefore, we deserve to have the OPT extension to make up for such loss.

Also, many international students do make contributions to U.S., no matter in business, industry or academia. It will be definitely a pity that the bureau restricts the legitimate working right of international student, and it doesn't live up to the "American dream".

Those who are against such proposal are actually afraid of competition, they just want to achieve more with less effort with such privilege. International students can also promote positive competition to help select better people qualified for industry and academia. It is by all means good to enhance the competitiveness both for individuals and U.S.
