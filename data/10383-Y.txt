For those who fear that this policy will increase the number of H1-B visa, which is not true. Moreover, H-1B workers do not harm native-born workers job opportunities, are not poorly compensated, and are not cheap foreign labor. In fact, their presence often leads to higher wages and more job opportunities. Highly skilled immigrants complement their native-born peers; they do not substitute for them. This is true throughout high-skilled occupations, but is particularly true in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Arguments that foreign-born workers and immigrants are depressing wages or displacing native-born workers are contradicted by the available evidence.
