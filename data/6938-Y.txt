I strongly support the STEM extension!!!!!
1. STEM students are people who have certain ability which our country need badly. We should accept them as a resource to serve our country.
2. We don't need to concern about the positions taken by them. They still need to get green card to stay in America. The number of green card is limited. They serve our country during visa state and can return back when they don't have green card.

I love America and we really need STEM students here!!!!!
