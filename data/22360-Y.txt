I certainly support the proposal to be approved, not just because of I'm one of the STEM students. I think the continuing creativity and prospect in the technology and industry of USA largely depends on its friendliness and opening to foreign STEM students and scholars. Without a statistics, you can tell how much percent of IT engineers are Asian who continuously contribute to the innovation and development of this "Digital Era", which makes the USA leading the world in technology, without these foreign engineers and scientists, I seriously doubt USA can keep its dominance in technology and compete against many other fast-developing countries like China, India or Europe companies.

Therefore, extending the OPT is a good way to keep those talented STEM students in America and contribute what they can. Imagine a Phd/Master student, who can work in their specialized area in America even without a H1B(if he/she failed in lottery), after that, he/she must be over 30s, probably already married and have kids. What do you think he will choose: staying here doing what he's best at or going back to China and start all over again ? (Be clear of one thing: Chinese IT companies/universities are providing much higher benefits to the high-end tech people, offers in big cities now are very competitive to what US companies can give) 

Plus, OPT isn't a green card, you just give those valuable students more time to contribute to US's economy and think about their life.

Let's get it approved !
