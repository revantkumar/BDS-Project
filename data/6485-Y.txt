I complete support it! The 24 months STEM program will create more opportunities for the graduates to get H1B and hence longer time to stay and work. This is definitely preferred for both the international students - since they are well educated in schools and should have the chance to use their knowledge in the real world; and for the companies who hire the international students - since they definitely do not want to let their well trained employees leave the company with only 1 year of service.
