Lily Lu The extension is necessary! People who just think this as foreign people stealing american jobs are stupid. Do you have any ideas how many foreign people are working at Big companies like Apple or Google? And do you have any ideas that how important these companies to the US economy? The reason why these companies can stay on top of their business is because they have all these talents creating the incredibles, making the amazing things! Without the extension, all talents would go to companies in China or India, and later turn back on us! If we lose the leading place to Chinese companies or some others, we'll know the pain of it! Do the right thing before it's too late!
