As an engineering student, I highly support optional practical training (OPT). Reasons are : 
1) There is a huge gap between what STEM students learn in school and how they can apply/upgrade the knowledge to fit for the job market. OPT do harm to no one but to give these students opportunities to apply/upgrade/transform their knowledge to productivity. 
2) OPT can help STEM students with a start of their career. Within this period, some of them will fall in love with what they do and some of them won't. A two year or so period of time is just about the right amount of time to let them figure out the answer. 
3) The world is going to be more and more unified. The real talents want to help a country with a welcoming attitude. STEM students need such a place with their dream companies.
