I think it would be a win win situation for foreign students, US employers and US economy.Students will get an opportunity to stay in the US for longer periods of time and earn experience and learning in their relevant professional feilds. US employers in turn will get to more chances to retain the employees on whom they have invested time and money and eventually benefit from the services they get out of them.And this in turn will then help the US economy get more taxes from these individuals. I completely support this decision.
