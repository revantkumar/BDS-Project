I don't know why are we son picky about giving access to people who want to making contribution to this great nation by working hard and using their professional skills which they learnt in here. Out nation is known for being acceptive and free will, what would this look like if we keep making barriers for these talents who truly deserve to stay? Wouldn't that be a huge discouragement and a total waste of resources considering how much our universities spend on them? Internationally students are not threats for citizens, I am sure this is a positive cycle for the progress of US by continuing bringing new blood. I am not even taking about giving them green card or anything. Just a simple extension would buy their more time. In all. I am strongly advocate the pass of this proposal.
