Extending OPT period to 24 months is benificial for all of us. On one side, international students can have more opportunities to get access to industry. On the other side, the industry field can get more well-educated and well-trained students to work for them. This opt program won't affect the job opportunities for local people, since all international students who apply for opt must find some kind of work that is related to their major and the total amount of time is limited(12 + additional period), they can't work forever. The job market is a free market, employers will always find those who are more skillful. We want to make our society more competitive, more energetic and more attractive. That's why we need to attract more talented students to come to US to make a bright future for our offsprings on this land.
