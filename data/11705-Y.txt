I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US.Foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX and they help local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge loss.Those property renting, food service and other industries will face huge loss
