STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide them with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. The proposed OPT STEM Extension will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.

The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of not only STEM students but also STEM Employers.
