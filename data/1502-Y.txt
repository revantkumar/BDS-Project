Cangji Wu I have to say, this is good. OPT students are passionate, once they got the job, they work harder than the native. And this pushes the US to a greater country. This is a land where people of vastly different cultures are brought together by their willings to work hard and their desire to succeed. This is a land made great by people standing out for what they believe. This is a beacon of freedom.
