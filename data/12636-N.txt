I oppose the Dept. of Homeland Security's proposal that would expand the O.P.T program. Allowing foreign students to come to our country to go to school then return to their home country to Impart their knowledge, improves the whole world. Allowing them to stay after they graduate to take away good jobs and drive down the wages of American tech workers however, is not O.K. Tech companies save by not having to pay their share of payroll taxes and also do not have to pay prevailing wages. Extending student's visas to 36 months will become a bridge for granting green cards which will end up permanently keeping these premium jobs from Americans. I am 73 years old and I am very sad about what's happening in our country. I remember an America from my childhood where there was a strong, patriotic middle class. We were optimistic about our lives and where our country was headed. Today those in charge no longer make decisions based on what's best for our country but rather how much money can be made globally. I am also thinking of Disneyland, southern California Edison company and others who now require Americans to give up their job and train foreigners to take their place. This is not what my father envisioned when he fought in World War II. He would roll over in his grave if he were to see what is happening to our country and the disregard of it's people. I'm glad I will not be around to see the final results.
