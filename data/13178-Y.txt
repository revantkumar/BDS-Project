I do not know any US company would take advantage of OPT STEM students in such a way to offer lower wages etc. From my own experience and my colleague's, we were treated equally when the hiring manager determined who to hire. In fact, hiring a student on OPT would cost more since if the company needs a long term employee, they have to file H1b petition for the person. I would disagree with the fact that OPT students are taking away jobs from the Americans.

However, one important issue I want to point out. USCIS has to implement stricter rules on organizations that take advantage of the H1b program. To illustrate this, I will describe as good as possible. A lot of multinational consulting firms are hiring from overseas where the future employees have no formal US educational background. They would submit H1b petition for those people and bring them here. However, the salary paid to those foreign nationals are way lower than the market rate. These consulting firms are taking advantage of these employees since they want to come here to get green card and the waiting period is typically 5 years so the consulting firm could drain every single cent out of these people for a very long time. This hurts the US job market.

To emphasize my arguments here, I would like to invite any party to do a research on all the companies that hire students on OPT and submit proof that students on OPT are getting paid less.
