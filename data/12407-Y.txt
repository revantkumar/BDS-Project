Actually, these students instead of spending the government money, are bring lots of money to this country while make our colleges more affordable. As far as I know, they spent 4 times the tuition and very little of them even have a fellowship. All this money are helping to keep our education cost lower instead of higher.

If you don't believe me, go to any tuition page and see how much the difference between an international student and a US student.
