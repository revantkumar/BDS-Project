I strongly support this ruling to expand OPT.

Because the US is built by hundreds of millions of hard-working immigrant from Europe and we need to keep that in mind. 

Those young people work very hard to get a degree in STEM from US universities, which means they are hard-working and gifted. 

The talent and hard-working they put together will move the technology forward and consequently create more jobs which makes more American people employed.

Therefore, I strongly support this ruling.
