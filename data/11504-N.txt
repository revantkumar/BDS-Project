With approximately 94,000,000 Americans citizens out of work, I wish you folks in Washington, DC would think of the 
American citizenry FIRST.

During the Great Depression there were just about 12 million or so people out of work. With as many of people who are
not working now I believe the priorities are in the wrong place!
