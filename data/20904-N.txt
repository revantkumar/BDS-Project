The US is already hurting for jobs for Americans, there is no demand for more F-1 students. I Operated a Forestry Service company in the Northwest for over 25 years and our main competition was from companies that hired illegal immigrants. They competed only because they worked for a lesser wage than out American men and women. Reese Brothers would many times do the technical jobs and the illegals would do the non-technical jobs taking away the ability to keep our crews working. The only reason the illegals performed the non-technical work was due to the lower wages paid the contractor who did not pay State Industrial Insurance, matching Social Security or Federal Taxes on their illegals. 
The illegal contractors finally put 150 Americans out of jobs while they continued to rip off the US System and not pay into it. The US does not need more of these workers, the US needs less of these types of workers. 

Protect the American worker first and then help other countries to help their workers.
