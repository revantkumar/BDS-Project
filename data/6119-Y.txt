Ricky Renna For a country whose very foundation is built on the blood and sweat of immigrants, this policy should be a no brainer. It's not taking away "precious American jobs from deserving Americans", it's simply giving students the chance to excel in their field and contribute to the business economy of the US. Foreign students in America strive everyday to be the best in their respective disciplines, as they know their time and stay in the country may be limited. They take every opportunity as a blessing, unlike many American born students who take their opportunities for granted, and never reach their full potential. Allowing their stay for an extra year is not something that will plunge the US into chaos, but rather the opposite. Skilled foreign workers are a boon to the national economy, helping bring in new ideas and a strong, motivated work ethic.
