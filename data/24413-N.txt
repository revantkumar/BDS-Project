My first big question is, why is this training program and benefits not available to American citizens, especially considering the high number of unemployed and under-employed "citizens". I realize that there are many unscrupulous employers looking for cheap labor, and then to add an incentive bonus for them to hire these aliens, is a kick in the teeth to all us taxpayers.

I know first-hand how this works as evidenced by the large number of foreign workers, some of whom have been here long enough to obtain citizenship, at my place of employment.

Just like an abortion of a baby can eliminate the next Einstein or Bach, this program passes over giving training and the opportunity to the most deserving American Citizen(s).

I work in an environment heavily involved government regulations, one of which, is "Buy American Act", but this rule is in direct conflict with that thinking.

American Citizens should always come FIRST in this great country of ours.

I just noticed that people from around the world can comment on this ruling. This is ridiculous considering that they should have no say on anything involving the sovereignty of the United States of AMERICA. What is this Administration thinking?
