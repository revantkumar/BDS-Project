As an engineer working in the IT field, I know how valuable those international engineering fresh grads are to the Tech firms. There are many Americans in this field, but the number is far away from filling the Gap. There are less and less young Americans willing to do the tech jobs, and those who has the skills and experiences usually don't stay very long in a company. Honestly, if two candidates are both qualify for one position, native speakers will most likely be the favor, at least in the cases thatI seem. However, most of the time you just don't find a U.S citizen to be qualify for those tech positions. 

IT companies are and always will be actively looking for talents. If we can not hire it here from U.S Universities then we will have to bring people directly from other countries like India. Why not keep those internationals who works hard, loyal to company and well-communicated for a longer period of time(OPT extension)? Sending international student away is easy, but if you change your mind later, it's nearly impossible to bring them back. If we let them leave this time and very soon they will become a very valuable asset to the companies in their home country. At that time it will be nearly impossible to get them back, so we have to either outsource our jobs or bring people in from other country. Either way won'd do any good to American techs.

We can easily get low-skill illegal immigrants, but it's hard to bring high-skill workers to the country. For all the reasons above, I support the 24 months OPT extension, and believe that will not impact the IT related job market at all.
