I agree to expand the OPT for F-1 students.

Immigration founded the greatness of United State. Allowing new people coming-in makes this country refreshed and always advanced in front of the world.

For most F-1 students, they are all potential elites of U.S. society, and the opt and extension is their only chance to stay in U.S. and works for the county's advance. Refusing the extension of OPT is equivalent to refusing these talents and refusing potential powers for U.S. society.
