I strongly support the proposal for extending the OPT period and cap-gap period for all F-1 students. I really believe both of F-1 students and U.S. citizens can benefit from this policy based on the following reasons:

1) I was a F-1 student and I am working in industry now. I am convinced that opportunities of practices in industry is a part of education. 2 years extension for OPT gives F-1 students more time on learning how to put what they have learned in school in to practices. This is the very reason that makes U.S. high education stands out from the rest of world. Without this policy, we might loss tremendous amount of talented students which will make U.S. education less competitive than others.

2) I also disagree with the saying that F-1 students shrink the job opportunities of U.S. citizens. It is in fact there are not enough human resources in U.S. citizens to fulfill the industry's demand. F-1 students and foreign workers plays a significant role in fields like IT, financial, business, etc.

It is the american dream that attracts people from all over the world. Shrinking the OPT period to protect local work force is against the american spirit to a large extend.
