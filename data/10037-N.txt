We need to be providing jobs for AMERICAN students so that they can be well-paid, tax-paying, contributing members of society. This is just ONE MORE attempt by Obamma to circumvent Congress and the best interest of the AMERICAN PEOPLE. Under no circumstances should companies be given incentives to "hire" foreign student graduates over American Citizens.
This Administration has made a bad Immigration situation worse. This must be stopped. The Economy cannot improve without more AMERICANS working.
