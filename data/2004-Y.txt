Eric Johnson I strongly support to expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non immigrant student with STEM Degrees.

Firstly, expanding OPT contribute to stimulate domestic consumption, which will drive GDP growth of America and create more employment. During 2013-2014, International students contribute to the U.S. economy by 26.8 billion and create more than 340,000 employment.

Secondly, I firmly opposed the view that OPT expanding will increase immigrant. This is because the number of immigrant are limited by H1B visa, which are just issued 80,000 every year. Therefore, expanding OPT will not influence the number of immigrant.
