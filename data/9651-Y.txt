I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer science master student from China and am a software engineer in a big US IT company. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in different places, e.g. US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I chose to study here is that US could provide students the real industry training opportunity after graduation. In this way, OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still be a dreaming country to attract so many foreign STEM talents and even to contribute their knowledge. I probably would choose to study in other country with better policy for foreign STEM talents. Besides, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. Please make this happen!
