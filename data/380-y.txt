Faizaan Kisat F1 students are some of the brightest and most driven students at US universities. They come from all over the world, seeking opportunities that are only available in the US liberal arts system. All too often, tax paying, talented students have to leave the US because they are unable to stay in the country beyond a limited period of time. Therefore, I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months because we need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the US.
