I strongly support to give an OPT extension to students in science area
International students is a big source of Manpower and make all kinds of contribution on science. They devote their energy in all kinds of jobs that American people may not want to do. 

After years and years studying in America we have developed a deep relationship and connection with all American friends and people . and we want to really pay back to American society and improve understanding and the collaboration between America and China. and we think international students who either bring their resources to America or bring their ideas to America is very important and America as the most developed country in the world should will welcome all the resources and ideas and voices from the world
