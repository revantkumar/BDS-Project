I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who gained knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and thus they can make contributions to the States.
2. Cultural diversity is crucial in a developed country like U.S. 
3. Competition does exist, but it's not a bad thing. Competition is just a way to recognize talents and stimulate the overall abilities of people.
