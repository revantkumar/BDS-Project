Dear Officer
I am writing in support of 36months OPT for international students. I think this is basic right for these students who eagerly need true industrial working experiment to complete lets their study abroad. 

Many of them spend tens of you sands of dollars here in US to acquire professional knowledge and yes US did it well to educate them and grant them credits. However, what also comes is a necessity to allow these students practice their skills locally. Not just exercise their skills, but also gain certain offsea working experiences so as they can have better odds when they went back their country. 

This is the rights of these students, nothing more and nothing less. Please grant them the right and not just taking their money. That's just wrong.
