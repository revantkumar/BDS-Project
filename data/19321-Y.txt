I have studied for 2 years in US. Based on my friends and my experience and I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is a brand for U.S. Before I came to US, I read from the news and hear from people that America is a land of dream and diversity. It welcomes all kinds of people regardless of their colors, races, religion, etc. And due to these people's effort US becomes a better place. Without this policy, people tend to go to other country which is more welcome to foreign intellects, which finally bring detriment to US benefits in long run.

2. I admit the competition does exist. However, competition does not mean a bad thing to the society. With competition to some degree, people will tend to learn more and become more productive. Competition can help US select better people for right position and eventually elevate competition ability of US globally.

3. Many students has come to US in the hope of OPT-extension. Cancelling this policy may decrease many students confidence in US. In long run, losing these people, who will contribute to US a lot in high probability, might not be a wise choice.
