I strongly support the OPT extension proposalI found no reason it should be canceled or shorten. 

Does OPT extension policy decrease the local employment rate of America?Not exactly! 

First the e-verified companies and institutions are limited, and most of jobs are still residents-only. The competition of jobs between residents and non-residents are limited. 

Second, unemployment of some people is fundamentally because of they are not competitive enough! It has to be cleared that, international students compete fairly or most of time in disadvantage position. Most of time it is more competitive for international students to get practice opportunities during or after degree, because we have to be very good to convince the company that it is worth to employ me, a non-resident, than a resident, even it takes more complicated processes and money to deal with International Visa issues. We should be excellent to make employers believe that during our OPT time, we can make valuable contribution even we should left after OPT ends. It is NEVER easy for international students to get an opportunity. There is limited number of international students who can get employed! 

Third, a lot of international students leave U.S. after OPT ends. They got the experience of practice during OPT to make themselves attractive and experienced, which help them find a great position in their own countries, which may even better than in U.S. So limited people stay and get long-time job in America. It is not true that international people capture lot of positions!

How could some residents attribute the unemployment to OPT issue? International students are not grabbing their jobs, but just get the real-world practice they shall have! Even some U.S. resident failed to get a position but an international student get, it is not seizing. It is just the algorithm of survival of the fittest! They really need more persuasive reasons to oppose the OPT extension.
