Liuju Wu As a Chinese student, I have enrolled in the OPT program. It not only gives me the opportunity to practice my school knowledge but also helped me gain a great network for my career success. I know some of the project will not end in a short time period. If this extension could happen, that will give the foreign student the opportunity to finish certain project to feel the full cycle of it. Also, with their knowledge I believe they are also brining great value to US economy and help on the industry improvement. I would greatly support this amendment and hope it will pass!

If I could help to provide more of my expierence regarding OPT. Please email me and I would provide more.
