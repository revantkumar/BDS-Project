Stop re-writing law. American people must come first. Over 90 million Americans are unemployed. Stop flooding the US with Foreigners to take Jobs from Americans. Stop doing the biding of large corporations. This is just another form of corporate welfare. The Federal Government's first priority should be to protect Americans, not foreigners!
