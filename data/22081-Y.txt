I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons. 

First, it is critical to our national interest. If we do not pass the new OPT regulation to hold those STEM students, they will do research, work for companies, or start their own businesses at their home countries or other places. They will bring the expertise, latest technologies, and great ideas away. Their future works will not directly contribute to the United States, but become the competitors of the United States, which hurts our national interest. 

Second, international students are important to the success of US-based international companies. Hiring international STEM students help those companies expand their businesses overseas easier. International students know cultures, laws, languages, and untold rules of their home countries better. These knowledge facilitates US companies adapt to overseas markets better. The success of US companies will finally bring more jobs to the U.S.
