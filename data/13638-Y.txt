The United States as a leader in global technology is in competition with other advanced countries. Hence, the need to maintain its current status as world leader. Most of the technological advancements are from ideas borne outside the United States brought in by International students who come here to study. Majority of these advancements took longer than a year-as with the case of most scientific endeavors such as research. One year of post completion OPT would not allow enough time to translate these ideas in to reality. It is either they are never harnessed, completed, or are taken to somewhere else. So the longer time a student has to gain experience in the United States, the more the opportunity for harnessing his/her potential for the economic, social and technological advancement of the country. Also, most of these technological advances translate into products that can provide jobs for American citizens. 
For this reason, I support the idea of implementing STEM OPT and extending it to 24 months. This will be achieved through increased enrollment which translate into income for schools and the economy.
