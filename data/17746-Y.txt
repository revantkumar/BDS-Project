Implementing the new OPT program will allow international students to work in the US and reduce the need of highly demanding H1b visa. It will also help the employers to have more skilled foreign employees to work on certain projects with lower cost. Also, this policy will lead to a higher number of foreigners come to America for degrees and increase the revenue of education institutes. I highly support this new OPT program, and I believe it will bring lots of benefits for many people and organizations.
