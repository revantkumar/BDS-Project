I completely SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. International students paid the tuition fee and studied in the U.S. universities. They gained knowledge and experience from those universities, they should also have the opportunities to stay in the U.S. after their graduation and make contribution to the U.S..

2. Some people don't like the competition between international students and U.S. citizens. From my point of view, the competition does exist. But it is definitely not a bad thing. International students leave their home countries to receive further study in the U.S. because they believe they can gain more knowledge and experience here. Many of them even were non-English speaker before studying in the U.S.. To make themselves fit in the environment in the U.S., they study even harder than many American students for they have to study and practice English at the same time. They try their best to catch up with American students just aim to be in the same level with normal Americans at the time when they graduate. So generally speaking, they are well prepared at that time. And they deserve a longer OPT time for them to use their knowledge to work in the U.S. just in case they don't get the "lottery" at the first time. 

3. Many companies in the U.S. lose lots of brilliant workers every year just because they don't get the work VISA from the "lottery". Although the companies want to keep these international students, they cannot just because they don't have enough time for the next lottery. It is a giant loss for these American companies. So it is very important to extent the OPT for these STEM students.
