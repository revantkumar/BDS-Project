I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program. Why is 
our government creating more ways to put qualified Americans out of work? Expanding this program would allow U.S. tech 
companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the 
employee's pay. Additionally, this program creates an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified 
Americans. There is not a shortage of qualified American workers. There is a shortage of integrity in our government. With 
recent college graduates and unemployed Americans struggling to find work, this is not the time to promote and expand 
programs like this for foreign workers. On the contrary, with over 90 million work aged Americans currently jobless, the U.S. 
government should be pursuing policies that would get Americans back to work.
