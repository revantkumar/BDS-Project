Winnie Zheng, Stanford University I strongly support OPT STEM extension to 24 months. 

1. Will benefit technology industries and in a way contribute economics of USA. 

2. Will benefit college and university and international students
1. Make the program attractive to international student who contribute to the tuition & living cost to support the cost of US education. Opportunities for internship and full-time jobs, in the constrained fields.
2. Not only good quality of education but also nice chance for temporary employed by companies in States.

3. DO NOT have big impact to hire opportunities to citizens.
1. Working as OPT status has to be in the student's himself/herself major. LIMITED majors are applicable for 24 months extension. Even in STEM majors, widely and strictly constrained jobs are available for international students. (Many positions require CITIZENSHIP or experience which not applicable to new college graduate).. 
2. Each state has minimum salary requirement....The low cost labors points NOT supported . Some international students indeed have greater ability and capability over native students, even in the same level of salary. 

4. ABOUT OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013
- It is not OPT or extension denies, but H1B which gives long time as working status. But the number of H1B visa each year is controlled in the way of lottery.
