I strongly support the proposal of Improving and Expanding opt for F1 students with STEM degrees.
The govement should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. university stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. And most of international students are attractive to study in U.S because of the chances to work in the U.S company to improve professional technology which will make themselves more advantages when they go back to home country. The large number of students have bring considerable profits for U.S. If govement approve to expand opt for F-1 Nonimmigrant students, more international students will be attractive to study in U.S which will boost the economy in U.S.
