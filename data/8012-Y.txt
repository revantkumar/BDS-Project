I firmly hold positive opinion on the new OPT proposal. It allow us, new graduate engineer to gain more work experience before we go back to our homeland. In the long run, experienced engineers can help the industrial cooperation internationally. Hope the policy can be more generous for well educated foreign students, especially for those focus on engineering major.
