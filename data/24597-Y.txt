It is past time to make policy that ensures America , and Americans first when it come to employment I hail from inner city Detroit an OEM business. You folks in the federal governemnt have given away most of the manufacturing base of this country. This is just more misguided damage to America and Americans The answer is no time to curb immigration,and work visa's
