You only train foreign students? You aren't living in a foreign country. You were supposedly hired to look out for the best interest of the American people and this is not doing it. You are only suppose to accept pay for doing this job from the American people and no other. Since there is no way you can tell us and have us believe you are acting in our best interest that leaves the obvious conclusion that someone else is paying you more than the American people are. You are on two payrolls. Obviously your other employer can pay you more than the American taxpayers can because you keep doing their bidding without so much as giving a flying fig about us Americans. Who are you? And what are you? You have no scruples.
Money is you God. Get out of our government. Americans neither want or need people like you in it.
