Sean Li I work at a public university on eastern coast. I don't have exact numbers but at least in my university, more than half of the PhD students are international students, these people are the ones who work late at night, work over the weekend, get paid low but are also the ones who really pushes the edge of technology and make contributions not only to this nation but the entire world. It would be really, really stupid to kick them out of this country after their graduation. If you look at Nobel prize winner list, see how many in the American winners are immigrants? This nation has already lost its battle in K-12 education now you want to kick the well educated and best trained scholars out?

And to those who worry about jobs: innovation brings more jobs than anything else, and preventing qualified people getting their jobs doesn't mean you are qualified to get that position.
