As a full-time employee right now, I can see there are many students who has great knowledge about high-tech but they just don't have the opportunity to contribute their productive influence to USA. Since international students spend a lot of money for USA, they deserve to get some chance to have a choice to work in USA and at the same time, USA could benefit a lot from them because of the creative mind and versatile thinking from international high-degreed students.

Also the enormous value created from these international students who owns a short-term OPT right now has already shocked all the world. People who don't know these big value should aware of this.

Fortunately, our DHS found out this big value and wanna keep it larger for USA.

GO, approve it.
