I strongly support this act for several reasons: First, STEM Degrees receivers in the past decades filled into most of American superior technical companies. It is a undebatable reason that America is still the most developed Country in the world. Second, create more opportunities for F1 student will attract more students from all of the world, and the cost of foreign students in US raise the economy, they pay the taxes and more. Last but not the least, why your people think foreign students will take away your jobs if you work hard and learn good skills in school? It only creates a relatively fair opportunities for the beautiful brains from all of the world, Right? Quite good decision, HSD ;)
