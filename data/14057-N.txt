I greatly object to ANY preferential treatment for education and jobs for ANYONE OTHER THAN A CITIZEN OF THE USA! I am tired ob being second fiddle to immigrants regardless of whether they are legal or illega. American Citizens need jobs. American Veterans need jobs. Until all able bodies American Citizens have jobs NO preferential treatment for education and jobs for anyone else.

With preferential treatment and the health care regulation changes and cutbacks, I have been out of work for over 2 years. I am paying for my own job retraining as I do NOT qualify for any assistance to do so. NOT FAIR to the citizens.
