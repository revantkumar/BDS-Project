I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.
2. For the most important reason, U.S. is a country based on legal competition and freedom, both of which drive the nation continuously moving advanced in every aspect of human life. The OPT extension is such a great way for many talented international students engaging and contributing in the advancement of the country.
