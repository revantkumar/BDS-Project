I totally support this, this is for betterment of US Economy also!!!! In my opinion, OPT STEM will not prevent US citizens from obtaining enough work opportunity. For non-STEM areas, OPT STEM does not apply to international students at all, which means the work opportunities available to US citizens in these areas will not be reduced at all. On the other hand, in STEM areas, although OPT STEM allows more international talents to work in US, it will also increase the absolute amount of working opportunities to US citizens in the long term.
