I support this new rule on STEM OPT Extension for the following reasons-
1. The STEM OPT Extension is primarily used by foreign "nonimmigrant" students that come in large numbers to the USA to pursue higher education in STEM areas. These students pay out-of-state fees here to go to school and thus bring in higher revenues to the universities here. Doing away with the STEM OPT Extension or even reducing it any lesser than what it originally was (17 months) may prevent these students from choosing USA as their choice of destination for STEM related higher education and thus decrease the revenue for the Universities here. This decrease in revenue is going to negatively impact teacher salaries, research grants, critical infrastructure development, etc.
2. Most foreign students that pursue higher education in STEM areas, end up working for science and technology companies here in the USA. These students contribute towards growing these businesses which in turn helps the economy. These students also directly help the economy by paying taxes, social security, medicare and so on. Reducing the STEM OPT extension is going to negatively impact all these areas.
3. From the history books of The United States of America, one can learn that USA became the largest economy and a world leader in many areas of science and technology because of the many invaluable contributions made by immigrants. Given this positive impact that immigrants have had in building this great country, it is only logical to continue to encourage students from other countries to come here to pursue higher education in STEM areas.
