It has been the long tradition of America for foreign people to come here and contribute to the American economy in a positive way. That is what makes America great. Due to its very well structured system, America has provided immense opportunities for talented people all over the world to come and work here, which has been beneficial to both the parties. Just take a look around you and see the Elon Musk's, Google founders etc. who have taken America to the pinnacle of technological innovation. 

Another point that can be made in favour of foreign workers coming here and getting visas is that America is in a dearth of people who can work in technology and/or talented and hard-working enough to do so. If foreign people with suitable education are not given visas, technology sector ( which contributes a large part of America's economy) is bound to suffer and falter.

So i am in complete support of this proposal and would like for it to get passed.
