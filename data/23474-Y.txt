Dear Officer,

Thank you for the proposal. I have to say the OPT extension is a win-win policy for the US as well as STEM students. The international students studying STEM are the most important human resources for the development of high-tech industry in the US. If the extension is cancelled, the students who have received the high education will be forced to come back to their own countries and then serve their countries. The American companies which highly rely on the international students will be less competitive compared to the developing countries, such as China. I don't think this is an appropriate way to protect the interest of the US.

Furthermore, the number of students coming to the US for studying will definitely decrease drastically if the OPT extension is cancelled because they know they cannot stay in the US after graduation. Then the international students will distribute to other countries rather than America. Because there are a lot of international students in the American colleges, the cancellation of the OPT extension will have a negative impact on the total enrollment for the colleges. For example, in my graduate school, the international student is even outnumber the native American student. So there will be a great loss for the universities if the extension is rescinded.

The USA has been nation of immigrants since it was founded. During the World War 2, the Jewish scientists came to the US and produced countless scientific achievements. Today, the international students with high educational background are also contributing to the development of the US. Therefore, I need to point out that the international students are not a burden for the US society. On the contrary, they are creating the employments and the development of technology for the US.

Thank you for your consideration!

Sincerely,

Yaoshen Yuan
