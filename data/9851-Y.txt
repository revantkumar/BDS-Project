Of course I support this new regulation.

But there are several things that can be done better here.

Firstly, define what is adequate for a mentor program and how the DHS can oversee it.

Secondly, DHS should make sure that this is not abused by international students who claim to be working in STEM but rather is doing something other jobs.

Thirdly, this new rule should leave room for further changes. Just in case there's changes in the H1B cap.

Thanks and have a good day.
