I think the OPT extension will make contribution to US.

This OPT is all about STEM students.Why cannot students not in STEM get extension? The reason is that US is short of talents in STEM fields.Companies can only hire citizens. But the fact is that many companies would like to hire OPT students even companies have to pay much more for their visa status. The reason of this is that citizens who are qualified to do these jobs are far not enough. If citizens can do all these jobs, why companies would hire so many OPT students with a lot of visa issues? In short, US needs talents in STEM fields.

Influence of US citizens is positive. US is the leader of a lot of areas in the world, and students would like to come here to study. Some very good students can get green card through OPT, H1B visa and finally citizen.It looks will make bad influence of native citizen's career, but there is a research shows that these people can make more contribution to the country.They may create new technologies in STEM and make more job opportunities. OPT is very attractive to students from other countries. And OPT extension in STEM can draw geniuses come to US.
