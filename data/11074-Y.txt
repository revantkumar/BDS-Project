I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE.
The reasons are:
It is the American spirit to give everyone equal chances. And talented International students deserve enough opportunities to practice their skill and even make further contributions to the industries they love.
It will benefit the economy of United States, because those STEM students who finally obtain jobs must be very talented, which will help the US to maintain its leading position in High-tech area.
A complete higher education system with sufficient post-graduation practice will attract more talented students coming to US. Furthermore, the income of education can also accelerate the researches in most colleges. 
The power of technology has already been the core competition strength of a nation, letting more and more talented students go back to their countries will potentially weaken the leading position of United States.

Meanwhile, many people object this rule because they mistakenly think this rule give privilege to international students over US workers, but actually not! Extending the OPT period only gives F1 STEM students more time to practice their skill and knowledge. The reasons why they obtain the job opportunities because of their special talent and sedulity. It is not privilege at all. The H1B visa will still ensure the privilege of US workers over international students.

If the US government just simply limit the opportunities of F1 student to protect US workers, the economy of US will be badly impact with no doubt.
