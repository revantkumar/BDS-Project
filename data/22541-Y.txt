I strongly support this rule in general.

The reasons I support this rule are these:

1. Foreign students with STEM degrees plays an important role in US industries. With this new STEM 24 month extension program, US companies will able to utilizing elite foreign talents from all over the world to solve US problems, helping US companies to take a leading role in the world. (One example: Tech industry)

2. These foreign students won't become an immigration problem because when their extension ends, they eventually have to leave US. 

3. It will be strategically stupid for the US to educate foreign talents and send them away, thus this extension program should be even longer. (Example: Singapore, which requires foreign students to work for Singapore for certain years after they graduate)
