MingYu Wang I strongly support the expanding of OPT for F1 nonimmigrant students for the following reasons:

1. The U.S. economy need international students. We cannot ignore the growing proportion of the current enrolled international students to the total students in STEM major in grant universities. These STEM programs offer the same efforts, the same quality of education and resource for their students (no matter if they are F1 or domestic students) to train the future leader the STEM fields. If a large proportion of these students cannot work in the U.S., contributing their knowledge and skills to the U.S. economy, I would say it is not only a waste of the education effort from both the students and university, but also a huge loss for the U.S. economy.

2. American people have put a great effort to chase the equality. For F1 student, they usually study hard in school, pay a lot more tuitions, and train well to compete their peers. When they come to the job market, F1 students deserve an equal opportunity with their American classmates. 

3. The expanding only offer F1 students a fair chance to the interview, not a guaranteed job position. It does not hurt any benefit of American people by all means. Competition is not a bad thing, it helps a company become more effective and mature.

Thank you for supporting this proposal!
