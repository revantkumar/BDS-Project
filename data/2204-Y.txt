I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

The government should let the students who graduated from U.S. universities stay in the country so that they can continue making contributions to the U.S.. And since they are given the chance and the excitement come along with it, their motivation towards would be much higher compared to that of Americans, so as the contributions they will be making.

And diversity is very important for the U.S. job market. Only competition would rive a more qualified job markets, and international students would serve very well on playing this role. Only hiring local people would only result in a less efficient and effective workforce.
