I am opposed to the DHS proposal to expand OPT which will destroy job prospects for American STEM workers by hiring foreign students over Americans. Our representatives seem more concerned with providing cheap labor for The Chamber of Commerce than providing jobs for American workers. America has many of the best and brightest right here, so if training is needed Why not train American workers? OPT removed $4 billion from Social and Medicare trust funds. This is shameful considering these two programs have deep financial problems. Hire American graduates and maybe then we would have more employed Americans contributing to Social Security and Medicare.
