Cheng Diao I'm a recently graduated Ph.D student and really care about the OPT extension, because it strongly affects me. 

STEM students are a group of people that are highly skilled and creative, which are vital to a country's development. The data has strongly shown that skilled STEM students have made huge contributions to US economy and research, and help to create more job opportunities to US. Therefore, the STEM students should have more opportunities to work in the US. Cancellation of OPT extension will only make employers stop hiring STEM students and even make the 12 month OPT meaningless. Eventually, it will deeply hurts US economy.

US is spending tons of money every year to solve millions of illegal immigrants' problem. Now, here are some highly skilled and creative STEM students requiring a simple rule to allow them to legally work in US for longer time, so I don't see any reason US government should reject this rule.

With the new 24 month OPT extension, the STEM students will have enough motivation and time to create something that could potentially change US.
