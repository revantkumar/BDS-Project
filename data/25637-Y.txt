I definitely SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:
1. Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees are mostly good students that are able to make great contribution to the society. Keeping them stay will make the U.S. stronger and boost faster.
2. As a comprehensive country with high diversity, it will break our principle to say no to those international students who want to do something for the U.S. We should accept them as our friends, after all they are nonimmigrant students.
3. Economy is boosting recent years. it is a good time for the U.S. to show her power to the world. Now we need more man to work and create to keep the speed of grow.
4. Expanding OPT time allow those students to stay longer. In the perspective of economy, this action enlarges the market and adds more dynamic customers to the market. This keeps and excites the motion of markets to expand and grow faster and stronger.
