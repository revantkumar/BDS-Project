I am an employee with OPT status in Oracle America. I believe that this regulation will benefit the US a lot. 

If there is no OPT extension, there will be little chance for us to get a work visa. It's known that IT companies in the US has many foreign employees like us who are in charge of important works. We don't want to leave our works behind.

Also employees with work visa pays a lot more taxes than those with OPT. However if all of the students have to leave the US as soon as the OPT expires before they can get a work visa, the government can potentially lose billions of tax incomes.
