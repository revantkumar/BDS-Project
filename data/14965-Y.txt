I strongly support this new OPT policy.

Here are my reasons:

1.There are thousands of international students get their jobs at IT companies like Google,Amazon,Facebook,Apple, they are brilliant and have high educational background,they make a lot of contributions to US economy,but only less than 40% of them can get H1B visa every year. If the OPT extension is canceled, the rest of these people will have to leave America immediately. This will be a significant lose to American economy. 

2.Some of those international students benefited from OPT policy before finally get US citizenship and continue make contributions to US for decades.

3.The U.S. consists of immigrants from the old and most of them made a huge contributions to this country. For example, lots of people came to America during The Second World War, most of them are professionals, engineers and scientists (Albert Einstein is one of them). This is why American developed so rapid and strong after the war. The STEM OPT extension rule is right to keep these American future elites.

4.Why would we educate foreign students with the most advanced technology on earth and then send them back to their own country to let them compete and beat down our own industry?
This doesn't make any sense and benefit nobody but our competitors!!!
