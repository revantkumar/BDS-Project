Many STEM jobs are waiting to be fulfill, while the most qualified candidates have to leave because of their expiring legal status. This is hurting the business, the economy, and eventually hurting the United States. 

Improving and expanding training opportunities for the F1 students will increase their chances to obtain H1 work visas.

This effort will enable us to keep telants in the United States to innovate and develop high technologies to help US to stay ahead of the global competition. If we can not keep these STEM telants, they will go back to their countries and help their countries to gain in global competition. 

These STEM students are not competing for jobs with domestic applicants as H1 visas are to be granted to the OPT students only when no suitable domestic applicants are found for the jobs.

So, i strongly support ICEB's proposal on improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students.
