To whom it may concern,

As an international student who is currently working in one of the largest semiconductor companies, I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. With 24-month extension, they would have better chance to obtain a H1B visa which allows them to work for the US companies, especially the High-tech companies. This helps keep the US tech industry ahead of the curve and boost the economy which has fully recovered from the financial crisis in 2008. This high-tech positions usually require specialized knowledge and skill set which makes it hard to find quality candidates among the US citizens. 

2. The good work opportunities is what makes US educational system more attractive than other countries. Many international students choose to come to US because they want to obtain a good job in US after getting out of school. If this 24-month extension ends up not being approved, a lot of prospective international students are likely to choose other countries to further their study because they know they have little chance to obtain a H1B visa in order to work in US if they only have one-year OPT.
