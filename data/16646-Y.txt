-I like that they are extending the time on STEM from 17 to 24 months.
-Having the STEM extension available more than once is a nice added benefit.
-For the students that are currently on their STEM OPT - will their employment be truncated effective February 16? Why? Are you going to allow some students to be "grandfathered into the new ruling?
oTruncating STEM OPT EAD's would not serve the students well. I think that it ought to be taken into consideration that those that are currently engaged in the STEM OPT should be able to complete their 17 months. Those that apply after 02/13/2016 should be required to comply with the final ruling.
-For students that are currently on their STEM OPT - will they have to pay the full $380 application fee for the additional seven months or will there be a prorated fee? 
oIt would be overzealous to charge the full amount.
-If the goal is to have the new ruling take effect by 02/13/2016, here are my following concerns:
oWill the changes to I-765 and SEVIS be done by that time? How will those changes affect the releases that are planned to go out in November and in the Spring 2016?
oHow are we going to deal with the current students that are engaged in the STEM OPT? How will they be notified if their EAD will be shortened? By DHS? The DSO? This needs clarification.
-Keen on the idea of expanding the CIP code list.
-Mentoring and Training Plan(s)
oGood idea, but what will there be guidance for small companies? Larger companies may have this feature, but I fear that this would prove problematic for smaller ones.
Will a sample template/form be available online? Please do not make this a burden on the DSO to provide samples to the student/employer. 
oWhen one is submitted, how will we know that it will fit DHS's guidelines/requirements? Will there be a webinar to train DSO's on spotting the good and the bad?
oSix month reports - would it be possible for the employer to send DHS the reports directly to them?
