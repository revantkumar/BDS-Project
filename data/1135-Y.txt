I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:

1. First and most importantly, US is a FREE country. Everyone who is able to do so should have a chance to stay here and make there own contributions to this great country. That's why America becomes what it is today in the first place. Without the international students working here, US high tech area would be greatly damaged. 

2. The US universities pays some of high tech international student a large mount of money each year to have them study here and do research. Those students should have a chance to stay here and make the contribution back to US. 

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. That's another great thing about US. People from different background would be more likely to make a difference. 

3. Competition exist, but is not a bad thing. Species without competitors would more likely become less energized. And after all, the US is competing with the world one way or another. Why not keep all these high tech people in its one pocket?

4. Those international students who work here make contribution to the country and pay large amount of tax every year.
