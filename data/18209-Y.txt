As a potential STEM student, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following two reasons:

1. Diversity is very important for the society of US. STEM student can do a great job to bring fresh ideas into American's innovations to make it keep moving forward.

2. Although competition exists, international students are equally compete with local students. A job offer is depend on the ability instead of nationalities. That's why US can be the most developed country in the world. 

So I will surely SUPPORT the proposal!
