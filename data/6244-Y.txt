I'm so surprised that there are so many people against it! Really? Rejecting non-immigrant elites to develop the high-tech/science industry, and accepting more illegal immigrant dishwashers? Come on! These international students are actually contributing to the tax of this country! You don't get a job simply because you are not qualified! You still don't get a job even without competition from those non-immigrant students. Guess what? It is the THEIR taxes that pay for your social welfare.

You think they want to stay in the US? It is a GLOBAL market nowadays! If you don't provide them job opportunities, they pay their tuition somewhere else, they help developing somewhere else, and on the other hand, you struggle on your own. You help waxing other countries by waning yourselves. How generous, Santa Clause!
