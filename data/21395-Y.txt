I support the increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. 
As an OPT recipient myself, I think that it should be extended to all fields, not just STEM. I was so fortunate to develop my career and contribute to this country that I now call my own through having been given this opportunity.

I am thankful for all that I received and I pay it forward in my career and my community.
