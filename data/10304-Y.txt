Docket Number: ICEB-2015-0002

I totally support this new STEM OPT program. I am an international student who just recieved my master degree in Financial Engineering in May 2015.

I list several reasons below to support the new STEM OPT extension.

First, compared with european countries, the most attractive aspect of the U.S. is the students can have longer training period after their graduation. It is hard to believe that a plenty of talent students who majir in STEM will still come to the U.S. to study without this new STEM OPT extension.

Second, based on the first reason, the large amount of students means huge tuition fee and incredle comsuming power. These are nice incentives to the U.S economy. According to the data from Association of International Educators, the international students made more than 26 billion net contribution to the U.S. economy in the 2013 to 2014 academic year. Besides, The foreign students also contribute their creation, knowledge and skills in the academic fields.

Last but not least, standing on the employer's view, normally, the projects or trainings for their international employee are more than one year. It is also hard for them to hire talent foreign students, if there are not enough working time for those employee. It is a huge loss not only for international studednts, but also for a lot of american companies.

In sum, it is a win-win for the U.S. and the international students to extend the STEM OPT program to 24 months.
