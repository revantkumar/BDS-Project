I graduated from Yale University with a master's degree in science. I'm working as an associate scientist in a biology lab. I thank I'm contributing to this country doing something that few American people will do. Most American people are more keen on financial field, where few foreign people will take their job. But for developement of America, it definitely needs these high tech industry. It will cause huge disaster once those elite students leave this country suddenly and it's impossible for companies to find so many good subsititutes from Americans.
