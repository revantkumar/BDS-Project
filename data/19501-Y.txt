I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. Openness and freedom is the basis value of the U.S.. There are a lot of very talented people among the international students, a lot of people who won the Nobel awards were international students in the U.S. before they become U.S. citizens. This kind of people can make great contribution to the progress of U.S. technology, which is a very important economy increasing point for the country. A lot of breakthrough science outcome in this country is made by the international researchers and workers, most of these people rely on the STEM policy to stay in the U.S. to keeping contributing for this country, so the proposal is very important and extremely useful, should be approved.

2. The government spent a lot of money and time to train the talented students, so it should keep the talents staying in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It can help the country find the best talents to make U.S. top the world and can increase the average knowledge level of either international or domestic students in the U.S..

To sum up, this proposal is very appreciated! Thanks!
