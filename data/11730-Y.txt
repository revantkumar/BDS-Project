I highly support this proposal. If the proposal is approved, I believe it will lead a lot benefits to the United States.
First, the proposal will attract more outstanding international students to USA to pursue their advanced education. For my instance, I decided to come to USA to continue my graduate study, which was because USA offered 29-months working opportunity. In that case, I can not only study high edged knowledge, but also have the opportunities to train my skills in a period of time. If the proposal is not passed, less students will pick America the country to pursue their study. Besides that, almost all the schools in United States have a big portion of international students. If the amount of students gets less in the future, it will impact the academy and finance of many schools.
Second, most of the workers on OPT extension are working at high tech companies and they are working very hard. If the OPT extension is not valid any more, it will definitely impact many companies and many families. We should let them continue to work.
Third, it represents the symbol of open and freedom of the United States. America is known for its open and freedom. If the proposal is not approved, it's like closing a door to many people in the world.
In summary, I highly support this proposal and hope it will be approved.
