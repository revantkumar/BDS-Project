I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons. Firstly, students who studied or studying in the U.S. normally are well educated. Talented and professional people are engines to support a country's development and innovation no matter what nations they are. The U.S. should provide opportunities for them to choose to contribute the country. Secondly, the extension ensures people with special skills staying in the country to raise competitiveness for a firm or an industry in the U.S. If some industries lose these highly skilled people or the source of hiring these people, they could suffer unpredictable losses, so that benefits of driving away foreigners and obtaining a few job vacancies for natives may be overwhelmed.
