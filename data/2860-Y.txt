I highly support this rule. 
the U.S. is no doubt the most developed country in the world. the technicists, experts, scholars from the STEM major have made a big contributor. you can easily find in most universities, who are pursuing the DTEM major beyond the college level, natives just make a small proportion. I think one reason is that these international students are more competitive, and of course, they can make more contribution in these high-tech fields. This rule is only about the STEM major students, not students from all majors. I saw many said it will have bad impact on the natives to find jobs. I think it is not true. because in STEM fields, the States need these talented and diligent employees. the international employees also need such a chance.
