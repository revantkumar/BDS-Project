I am opposed to the Department of Homeland Security expanding the Optional Training Program. The OPT has already denied more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013. Also, it has removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Like other employment-visa program, OPT works to lower the wages and standard of living of the middle class.
