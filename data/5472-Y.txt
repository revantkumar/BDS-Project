Kathy Tolman Most of our families were immigrants. I myself am second generation American. My family was able to come because they needed miners in Colorado. Although times are different, we still need talented educated people here. We need to make it possible for them to be here legally. We all need each other still. It is good for all of us to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students.
