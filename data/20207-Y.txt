America needs talented individuals, especially those pursuing STEM Ph.D. degrees, from all over the world. It would cost taxpayers more to cultivate native workforce within USA alone. Most Ph.D. students I've met here are F-1 students, with only a few exceptions being American citizens. These talented individuals were already highly trained and survived fierce competitions in their home countries before they land a position as Teaching/Research Assistant in the course of their Ph.D. study. They help professors teach and more importantly they play an integral role in contributing to the prosperity of research community. Without them, the current academic system may crash since not many American citizens are willing to go through such intensive training. The reason behind is that there is no need to work that hard if they already can maintain a comfortable life given all the privileges of being born in the U.S. International students always beat native students in this way not because they accept lower wages, but because they have to work harder to get the chance. These qualified individuals are worthwhile to maintain based on employment, and in return, as they are joining the middle-class and upper-middle class, they could probably contribute more to the tax than an average American household, not to mention the contributions to the economy and people's life by advancing technologies. The fact is that any equivalently talented and hardworking American citizens always get better chances in the job market. Those citizens complaining about immigrant workers are most likely the ones who party too much and contribute too less. It's definitely a loss for America to shut down the road of immigrants by not extending OPT since many other countries are eager to woo them back.
