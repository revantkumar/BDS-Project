I strongly SUPPORT the proposal! Can you imagine if international students do not get H1B for intern or full time in the short OPT period? U.S. industry cannot remain these high-tech intelligent only because of the short OPT, I believe there would be a great loss for U.S. 
Everyone citizen in U.S. could make an easy choice between high-tech intelligent immigrant and the undocumented immigrant.
