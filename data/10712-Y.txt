Currently, there is an undersupply of qualified STEM graduates for jobs that are getting increasingly more technical. H1-B visa system is ineffective to solve this undersupply due to its cap. USA needs these employees to continue its technological superiority and growth. STEM extension is a good measure for US educated smart people to contribute to the US economy, as opposed to taking their talents elsewhere. I support this rule.
