I am totally against this. If a student is an exceptional student they should be given work extensions and encouraged to stay in US. We need jobs for US students. How is this even a Homeland Security issue. Another policy skirted around instead of due process being used and checks and balances. More and more like a monarchy. Very disappointed in this administrations always putting foreign and big business interests above US interests.
