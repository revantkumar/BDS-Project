I strongly support this rule. This is a very good policy which attracts the most talented students from all over the world to the U.S. Imagine that if students know that they cannot have a chance to practice what they've learned and researched in the country, why do they want to even select the U.S. to advance their studies. The U.S. would lose the best students which could potentially become research leaders in many important areas. Remember that attracting best people from the world has made the U.S. one of the best countries in the world. 

On the other hand, for those who have spent years in study in the U.S., many professors in prestigious institutions spent years mentoring and training the students. As far as I know, the top tier universities require at minimum 5-7 years to train a ph.d student. When they graduate, they will be kicked out of the country. This is a HUGE waste in time of those professors, in educational resources of schools and in fundings such as NFS. I don't understand the rational why the U.S. wants to spend so much and finally prepare excellent researchers/scientists/engineers for other countries. 

I think this rule definitely makes a multiple-win outcome. It benefits researchers/professors, as they would be able to hire high quality students. It benefits students, as they would be able to use what they learned after graduations. It benefits academia/industries, as they get the well trained students/employees which can do nothing but good to the fields. I also understand that the rule seemingly hurts the right of American, mostly likely American students (considering those who competes with OPT holders). I think the best way to ensure a job is make self more skilled/competitive, instead of wanting to be protected in a shell and trying the best to disqualify any possible competitors.
