Paul McCandless I support the policy of OPT extension. Most companies who are related to STEM majors needs this policy. Companies, especially the IT companies in the Bay Area, needs tens of thousands of newly graduated students per year. In the mean time, there are not enough native Americans who choose these areas as their college majors. With OPT extension, the companies will be able to get much more employees. And this will benefit both the companies and the United States.
