I strongly SUPPORT the STEM extensions, considering following aspects
1. International students have been significantly contributed to economical growth of America. "For the 2013-2014 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs" - See more at: http://immigrationimpact.com/2014/11/19/international-students-add-billions-u-s-economy/#sthash.bn06IK7p.dpuf - they rent apartments, shop luxury goods, and pay higher tuitions, which has greatly benefited U.S businesses.

2. Since international students pay higher tuition, the institutes have more funds to improve their facilities and provide more professional services to ALL the students. You get what you pay for it. They pay more, they should get chance to practice. If we cancel this program, they won't be willing to come to the US to study.

3. MOST STEM jobs are for US Citizens only. STEM students cannot even get chances to interview. I would suggest US STEM workers focus on improving professional skills rather than objecting to a rule that would benefit the U.S

4. Companies hire only most qualified employees. Because OPT is training period, and applying H1B would cost a lot of time and money, H1B workers get same level of payments as the US workers. OPT Extension allows them to apply for H1B visa. If anti-immigration people are concerned about this, they should urge DHS to increase H1B visa amounts so that foreign workers don't have to work on OPT student visa.
