As an international students, I strongly recommend this extension for STEM students.

First, STEM related industry is the most important fields to every country in the world, including America. Technology and Science have ever increasingly reshaping the world and still have the greatest impact on the development of a country's GDP and people's well beings. As we all know, the silicon valley even contributes more than 1% of GDP in the US. America has always supporting the development of IT industry, it should keep on doing so and give a big welcome to those STEM related Nonimmigrant students. This does not only provide benefits to students but also to most citizens in the US. By improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Student, more and more international students will plan their education in America. Thus bring money into this country, all kinds of industry and services will benefit from it, most Americans will get a job more easier. Take the city of Bloomington, Indiana as an example, 80,000 US citizens out of a total of 200,000 populations are working and providing services which are related to International Students in Indiana University, which is located in Bloomington. This win-win example is a compelling evidence that the US should welcome this STEM related students.

Second, this extension and expanding will no do harm to the employment rate of the US citizens. From my personal experience in Indiana University, less than 1% American Students major in STEM and most of these students can get a job easily upon graduation. This implies that non-immigrant students have little of an effect on the employment rate of US students. On the contrary, such a small proportion of citizens major in STEM shows that there is a huge demand for international student.

The above statement from my experience as an international students in Indiana University suggests that this Proposed rule should be voted.
