Shi Wang I strongly support this rule! It's oversimplifying the situation when people say the rule will "give away jobs to foreigners". 40% of the high tech companies that went public were founded by immigrants. Think about how many jobs they created! It would be a shame if people don't see the contributions high tech immigrant workers had made to the overall economy of this country. Moreover, the rule will not affect the H1B work visa quota. It will only make the lottery more brutal for STEM students to get a work visa n the future. The H1B quota is 85000 each year, which means only this number of high tech workers are allowed to stay and work here legally each year, the rest would have to leave the country. Compared with the number of illegal immigrants that is 14 million as of year 2014, which makes 5.1% of the American larbor force, I really don't see why people would want to discourage students with college or more advanced degree to stay in the country. If unfortunately people do see these students as competition, please be more hardworking, instead of trying to kick them out of the game by labeling them aliens.
