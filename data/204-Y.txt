What are you doing? You have brought down the unemployment level significantly... and we are grateful, but now you want to bring in more foreigners to supplant available workers? What are you thinking? Is this payback for campaign contributions? In the name of, by and for the people who elected you, cease and desist this unconscionable and thoughtless initiative...PLEASE... We believe in you... don't change our minds in your last term...
Yours Sincerely,
Robert Woods
