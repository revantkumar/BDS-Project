I support the OPT extension due to the following reasons:
1. More international students working in Ameica can bring more ideas from different perspective and make Ameica more competitive in science field and even politics.
2. This policy will attract more international student sources and let America remain its dominated place in the studying abroad field as one of the best choices for student to study abroad. 
3. Extension for OPT is a symbol of Ameican spirit because it claims that every one has the equal chance. American spirit will spread around and have positive influence on the world by this policy.
