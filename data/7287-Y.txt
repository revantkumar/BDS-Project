yan shi What I think is that should increase the amounts of H1B visa for each year, especially for those international students who got degree at united states. Those students paid for tuition to get a degree, and they should deserve a better and much more chance to stay in America if they want. 

For the new opt extension, I think it is a pretty good idea to help international student to gain experience and have the opportunity to continue live in America. For the another 5 months more than old version Opt extension, that would give international student to have one more change to draw the H1B visa in near future. But the problem comes out, person who did not lucky enough this year would compete the next years share, and would not be fair for international students who come America later from the beginning of new opt extension policy. I really hope the government not just consider the international student to span their chance to get a job, but also think about what the odds of getting a H1B visa to stay here. 

Thanks,
