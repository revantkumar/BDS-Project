OPT extension is important for student holding F1 VISA to get employed. It also beneficial for American employers. Students from STEM keep making contribution to the economy development of U.S.. Without them, many employers have to pay a lot of more money for unprofessionals, or even can not find one. Here, I believe OPT extension is critical for both student and U.S. companies. Therefore, I strongly support it.
