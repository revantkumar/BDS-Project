I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Currently, high-tech companies drive the US economy, but there are not enough US citizens qualified for the employment needs of these companies. Hiring STEM students is a good and common way to solve this problem. With new OPT extension rule, high-tech companies keep their entry-level employees for longer time, which means these companies do not need waste their resource like time and money for training new employee once a year. The students with OPT also pay taxes, but they do not enjoy any benefits from US government. 
The new OPT extension rule will attract more foreign students to study in the US. During period of their study in the US, these students will spend a lot money, such as food, house rental, traveling and shopping, which will make a great contribution to the increasing of the US GDP.
