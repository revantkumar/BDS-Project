It is good for F-1 students since they have more time to gain international working experience. And it is definitely also great for U.S. economy. First, this new policy could allow U.S. to hold F-1 students more time to contribute to the U.S. economy. Second, the U.S. job market could be more constantly vital. More people are competing in the market, more choices are offered to companies. Also, due to the competence among job seeker, the average skill level of candidates in job market could be better. That make companies able to find candidates with great skills in a shorter time. With the new policy, it is not possible for companies to hire F-1 students with great skills with a salary much lower than that in the job market. So, every candidates in job market compete for a job with their skills.

All in all, the new policy is great for US and F-1 students.
