I strongly agree the new rule. I'm an F-1 Student with stem degree. I really want to work in the US after graduation. However, it's harder for international students to hunt for an ideal job compared to American students because of the restrictions of work permission on international students. It means I need to spend more time to find one. However, one year OPT period is too short. If taking off the time of hunting jobs, there may be only 9-10 months left, which is very embarrassing.
