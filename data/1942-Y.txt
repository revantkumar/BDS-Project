rich smith I strongly support this rule. These young men are really what we need. smart, intelligent, work hard, full of creativity, most of all they follow the rules. Why should we allow poor, uneducated, low-breaking illegal immigrants to work but don't give these people permission. Doesn't make sense to me, and it won't make sense to our economy.
