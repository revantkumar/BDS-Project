I am a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering(BME). BME is a comparatively new field which excludes areas such as biomaterials, tissue engineering, medical devices etc. our aim is to improve the health care of man kind. As you can see, BME is a highly intradisciplinary subject. It requires collaborations between people with diverse background. And because it solves the issue not only within America, but also around other parts of the world, it is important for our program to seek competent students abroad. Fortunately, I'm one of them.

However, BME students some times have trouble finding a job or a follow up degree after graduation. Mainly because that we are a developing subject, and the number of companies and labs within the area is quite limited. So expanding the OPT for STEM students is crucial for us. Here I strongly advocate the government to do so. Because we need the opportunity to further apply our knowledge to medicine, and America need the opportunity to make the best use of its resources to do so.
