I just got my PhD from a US university. Now US invites so many STEM students to US to get 
higher-education degree for free. US actually is doing an investment because
most of benefits can only be harvested in the next few years after 
graduation. Then after graduation, US said you immediately get out of here 
and contribute whatever you learn to other countries. If this is true, then 
US is indeed stupid. Because after graduation, the investment cost is already put 
there, the game is already started and now in the middle, without a good 
working policy, most of cost cannot be converted to benefit in the end. It is of US benefit to keep those STEM students staying in US with a 3 years OPT policy!
