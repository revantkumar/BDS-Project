I strongly SUPPORT this rule.

As a hiring manager. I could feel hiring will be a headache if we do not have a chance to keep foreign students. 2 years of OPT could help us maintain some talented students with great communication skills. We did give the highest priority to local students but the number will be limited if we don't have a great number of pools.

Also we could feel world-wide competition makes it essential for us to import some foreign workers because we need to know other countries culture. Diversity is quite important for a company.
