Dear Chief Westerlund:

I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RULE. As an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and graduated in 2014 with a master's degree in the field of Traffic Engineering. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes. 

However, based on my recent observation on the available jobs in NYC, at least five jobs are opening simultaneously without any applicant applying for that. The high requirements of these jobs making less people qualified to obtain it, however, it is even harder for international students to get that job. Lacking of enough qualified applicants, I think it is the government's responsibility to make this place more attractive to the professions. And STEM OPT is definitely the best solution we have now.

Though I saw many native Americans yelling at the US have enough STEM labor, I still see lots of vacancy in my filed. So I highly doubt where did they get the statistics, and if the statistics they got reliable. 

It is not denied that the international students will bring competition. However, this kind of competition is not fierce enough to replace any qualified domestic worker. And the competition here will leads to improvements of domestic worker quality, and pushing them keep exploring more in their field.

With this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.'

Sincerely,

Mr & Ms Tse
