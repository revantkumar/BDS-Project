I support this rule. 

Many negative comments here focuses on this rule would take jobs away from American students, which is NOT true. The rule clearly explained why that is not the case, and I'll state my opinions here:

1. There is a huge demand for skilled STEM workers in the US, which is not filled by American students. Bringing in foreign students help reduce this gap, and is by no means taking jobs away.

2. The rule only grants temporary work authorization, so if two candidates are equally qualified for the job, American student will be favored by the employer.

3. The U.S. is and has always been an immigration country. Being open is what makes this country strong and united. Keeping the best minds from the globe to work in this country will benefit in the long run.
