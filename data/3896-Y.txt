Dear Mr. Johnson,

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a graduate student / international student at the University of Central Missouri (UCM). 70% of UCM graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. We will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.

OPT and OPT extension is important to be because we have very good opportunities here and it will be helpful for us to excel in out fields.

I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension or the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.



Best regards,
