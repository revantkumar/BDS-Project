I strongly support the proposal. The United States needs the policy to attract more innovators who already learned knowledge from US. Besides, the list of STEM could not cover all the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. I conducted my PhD degree in the area of water quality in the department of Aquaculture. Almost all my research were mainly based on chemistry, and thus I definitely believe my major should be considered into the science category. But, the Aquaculture did not categorized into STEM. This limitation could be minimized by permitting an F1 student to use prior eligible STEM degree from US institution to apply for OPT Extension.
