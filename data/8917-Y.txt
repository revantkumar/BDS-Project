obviously, the advantages of expanding OPT outweigh the possible disadvantages. For one thing, the STEM graduates are important for many hi-tech american companies. The companies devote time and resources to train the graduates with the expectation that they will make contributions to the companies. However, if the OPT of the STEM graduates cannot be prolonged and they have to leave for this reason, that means the companies have to recruit new staff and re-train them again and again. Why the companies have to suffer this? For another thing, if the hi-tech companies stop to recruit international STEM graduate students because they do not want to take the risk anymore, then there would be less and less international students apply for STEm majors since there are no incentives for them to do so. In that case, the STEM higher education of the universities in the states would suffer because the excellent international students would prefer go to other countries which may offer much better opportunities for them to work and live.
