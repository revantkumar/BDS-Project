I support this proposal!!!

Don't let the talents go back to their own country. Although it sounds selfish, I do hope they can make contributions here. Also, they can bring a lot of money to America, such as education, consumption and taxes. For students they don't earn money but they are paying a lot. It's pretty good. 

If you can canceled OPT extension, I am afraid there will be fewer international students coming for education. There will be less visitors coming to send money to US. Thus, we will have a huge loss.

All in all, this is good proposal which is good for US!
