Dear Sirs: 

The Optional Practical Training (OPT) program is, one would assume from its sponsorship by the DHS, proposed as an aid to the security and well-being of America and its legal citizens. 

How does the denial of 430,000 jobs (from 2009-2013; according to FOIA info) to American workers constitute an aid to their security or well-being? Seems as if inability to find gainful employment in their chosen field would engender just the opposite of security and well-being.

How would further fleecing the Social Security and Medicare trust funds ($4 billion has already been removed by OPT) lead to security and well-being of anyone who wasn't in this program and therefore NOT an American citizen? Obviously it would not be a benefit to the U.S. Taxpayers. (Figures are from the Center for Immigration Studies per a FOIA request).

If we are in need of these specialized workers why not use Americans to fill the jobs? If we are in need of "Specialized" workers from abroad, why do they need to be trained? Why not train Americans (if THEY need training at all)?
The answer seems to be that the DHS is not interested nor in the business of HOMELAND SECURITY at all. Rather they seem bent on the denigration and destruction of yet another segment of this Republic. The name is a cruel joke on the American people and this program is an overt attempt to further degrade our once proud nation to Third-World status. 

I implore you to do what is right for America and Americans and end these destructive nonsense.

Most Sincerely

John Embry
