Yes this extension should be applicable for all F1 students. I don't believe I will contribute less to the States than STEM students. I want equal treatment. 
I also believe that active competition will lead to further prosperity of the States. I understand local people want less foreign workers in this country so that it will be easier for them to find job. However, I believe this only matters when local people think the likelihood that they will lose to foreign workers are significant. When someone with great language advantage loses, it is obvious that he or she is just not that competent. For those people, it is more reasonable to help them with social security system than to secure a job for them.
