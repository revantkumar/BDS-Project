I think this is a great step forward. I would absolutely vote for it.
It'll be even better to exclude STEM students from the H1b cap. Those who are able to find a job in these areas definitely deserve to at least have their application reviewed by a USCIS officer. The lottery is just too stupid. It is the luck, not who you are or how excellent you are or what skills you have, that determines whether you can apply for a working visa. This doesn't make any sense at all.
