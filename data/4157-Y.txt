I support the extension of Opt to 24 months, because it gave international students more time to experience the working environment in the United States. some employers do not even consider international students as their candidates because of short time of opt that won't benefit the company much. For long-term perspective, extension of opt will benefit local US companies to hold people assets longer as well as creating opportunities for diversity culture communication.
