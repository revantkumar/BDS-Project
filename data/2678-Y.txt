Yang Li I strongly support the proposal of amending the F-1 non immigrant student visa regulations on optional practical training (OPT) for certain students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from U.S. institutions of higher education. 

First of all, U.S. citizens are facing the challenge to fill all the STEM related positions by themselves. It will be benefit both U.S enterprise and STEM F-1 visa students if the new regulation gets approval, comparing with the unnecessary hiring and training cost for new hires year by year due to the F-1 non immigrant students have to leave in a short term.

Secondly, according to the employer report, most of those F-1 non immigrant STEM students are very hard working and perform quite well, whose contribution to the company is above the average and helps U.S. economy, especially in the high-tech industry to grow.

Last but not least, the technical skills of STEM graduates is very competitive and critical to most of the top enterprise. With the the H1B visa lottery being more and more intense, the new regulation provides more chance for those enterprise to keep those talents they really need.
