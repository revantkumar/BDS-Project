I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Most of them graduated from the top U.S. universities, they should be given the chance to contribute to the US. It's so stupid to let them come and study all the skills, go back to their own country directly and make contributions therein. OPT extension will improve the chance of the top students to stay. And from the past years' experience, they definitely have made great contributions to the US in STEM area. Obviously expanding training opportunity is a wise decision.
