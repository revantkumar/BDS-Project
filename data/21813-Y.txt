Hi all,
I strongly support the new OPT extension with the following reasons:
1. To myself, spending two years studying here brought me professional and powerful knowledge in my study area, a short term working period is not long enough to apply what I learnt from University. a 24 months extension provides a great opportunity to evaluate my knowledge and skills achieved from study, and this should be definitely contained in a professional study program.
2. The new rule is not only the benefit for me, but also for employers. My employer was an organization which only hire experienced people ten years ago, however, in the recent years, more and more fresh men who use OPT are hired. This definitely brought a great benefit to my employer. The firm became more effective and innovative with the fresh blood brought by the new employees like me. My employer is happy on this, and would like to hire more freshmen who hold OPT.
3. Providing us a 24 months extension doesn't mean every foreign students would stay in US for 36 months. Getting hired is still the most important step during this period. Selected by employers means we are good enough on the job positions, therefore, why don't give us 2 more years to contribute ourselves into this further work?
4. I know most of you wouldn't read here,but I still would like to say, I'm enjoying my job, I feel really happy working with my co-workers, we work as a great team. This experience must be very helpful on my future career, and also will leaves wonderful time to me and my colleagues.

These are the main reasons I support this new OPT extension rule.
