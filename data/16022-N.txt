Non-citizens of this country should not be allowed Optional Practical Training. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to return home after graduation. The current administration wants to extend it to 36 months. Hello??? Why are more and more NON citizens of the US being allowed to hold jobs when so many AMERICANS cannot find one?
