Perry Brown Our group just lost a great coworker this summer who failed in his H1B visa application and OPT expired as well. He is a smart guy and have many good ideas. He is always passionate about his work and life. Now he has to go back to Malaysia. I have heard those stories from time to time. Just hope improving OPT programs would be a good solution.
