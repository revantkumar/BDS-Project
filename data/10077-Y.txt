I strongly agree with the extension of OPT for the following reason. Many talented students have made their own contribution to the development of this country. Without them, there is a disaster for the American Economics. Many tech-giants are having foreign students working in it. I don't know the extension of opt will lead to the unemployment of native Americans. Many STEM majors are quite technical and as far as I know, most native Americans are not major in these majors. So from the reason above, I agree with the extension!
