Danielle Valles Good evening, 

Thank you for reviewing and updating the STEM OPT extension policy. I feel strongly that this is a program that attracts international students to U.S. higher education institutions, generates revenue, and enhances the lives of international students. The STEM extension allows the U.S. government and economy to draw on the minds and talents of the best and brightest to continue improving our nation benefiting both U.S. workers and international students alike.
