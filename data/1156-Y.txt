First, I strongly support this rule.

Second, people have the right to post tons of negative view on this rule BUT we all know the fact most of the non-sense comments were coming from the same person. Like saying America & American first. Without all the talented foreigners, will America developing fast? If one is good enough, how come he fears that someone else will take the job away from him? Crying out loud on reserving the job for you(especially you are not good) won't help America, it will destroy the country! We need the competition, we don't need those crying for a job! Those crying man, you can always go study and come back.

Last, I suggest when reviewing the comments, don't count on the number of comments, count on the words. We got many who thinks of themselves, not the country!
