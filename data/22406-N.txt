I cannot believe that the O'bama administration would willfully allow 360,000 workers over 3 years in a field
requiring a college degree allowing companies who would pay higher wages actually pay substantially less while DENYING SSI approximately $750 MILLION in revenue by allowing these WORK PERMITS. 

This is not just a slap in the face of anyone trying to get a job in this lucrative field by driving down the wages and benefits but this administration has actually found a way to hurt seniors and the SSI program more. This has to stop and stop now.

Please reconsider the unemployed college graduate and the future of the SSI program and revoke these permits. 

Thank you
