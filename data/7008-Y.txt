Angie Wang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. As a potential student for the next year, the OPT is definitely one of the attractions. Without OPT, there will not be much difference between US and Europe, while the latter requires less education fees.
2. Competition does exists, but it is not a bad thing. We should commit that the contribution of international students is an irreplaceable part of the progress of US. More importantly, many of the job roles which are not welcomed by US citizens are done by international students.
