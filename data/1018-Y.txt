There are clearly a lot of misunderstandings for this from some of the citizens, they seem to believe that "if we hire less foreign student, we will hire more local citizens like us and pay us more", which is totally completely wrong.
1. STEM students are high-skilled and very well educated. The truth is, those students get hired because the companies cannot find other local citizens who can fit the job. Which means, "hiring less foreign students" does NOT equal to "hiring more local citizens".
2. In case some of you don't know, company need to pay a lot more to the government and USCIS to hire a foreign student than hire a local citizen. So there must be a reason that companies tend to hire STEM students rather than hire cost-less local citizens.
3. From 1 and 2, let's say if the companies cannot hire enough qualified employees -> their growth will be hindered -> economics grow slower -> more unemployment and less wages for current employees.
