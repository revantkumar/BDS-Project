I am most certainly opposed to the expansion of "OPT". As an American tax payer and father of four children who are finding it ever-more difficult to land good jobs, I find it reprehensible that our government would in any way further degrade the future well being of this generation. Additionally, the loss of payroll taxes to this scandalous plan will, in my opinion, further weaken the social security system. As a "generational promise" social security funding MUST be restored and made whole - an entire generation of hard-working American's are depending on these funds for their retirement years. I should know, I will be one of them in the next few years!
