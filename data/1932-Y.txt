I think 24 month OPT extension is very necessary and beneficial for the economy growth of US and the US national interests. Since lots of the STEM students are talent student graduate from top Universities in US. They have very good educational background and can make significant contributions to the US society. Lots of famous professors in top universities and entrepreneurs in US was STEM F-1 students before. But right now, since the limited H1B visa each year, lots of talented STEM student can not get H1B visa using only 12 month OPT and another 17 month OPT extension. And these talent STEM student can only return back to their home county since they can not get a H1B visa. So 24 month OPT extension allows these talented STEM student have more chance to a H1B visa and they could use their skills and talent to contribute to the US society. 

So I think the 24 month OPT extension is necessary and must be implemented to let US be the leader of cutting edge technology and to maintain the growth of US economy.
