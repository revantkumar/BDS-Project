I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule. U.S gain more than 10 billion usd per year from the tuition that the stem student paid for studying in U.S. One of the most important reasons they chose U.S. instead of other countries is it provides the best after-school training opportunity (17 months STEM OPT). That is a huge impact on the current U.S. education ecosystem that has already adapted to wide internationalization.
