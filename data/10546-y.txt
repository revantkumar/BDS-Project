Jerry Lin I FULLY SUPPORT this rule. The economy of U.S., the company and the international students will all benefit from the new rule. 

As a data scientist, based on my own experience, 12 months are not enough to train a new employee, help him/her be familiar with the data and model and then start working on real projects. If the new rule is passed, there would be enough time for these international students to learn the data/model/project and contribute to the company. If the OPT extension could be 36 months, that will be great. 

Besides, I know a lot of international students with STEM majors. They tell me that one of the most important reason for them to choose study in U.S. is the OPT and OPT extension program. They want to get not only knowledge from school but also industrial experience. Without the OPT and OPT extension program, they will not put U.S. in their first choice since the tuition and stipend is much expensive than other countries, like Europe, Australia, Canada.
