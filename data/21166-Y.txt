I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the international students who acquired knowledge from US make contributions back to US.

2. Diversity is a very important issue for US, international students with higher education backgrounds on STEM will boost this diversity and the quality of diversity as well.

3. It will not influence the job opportunities of US residents because the companies still give the priority to the residents and only if they cannot find proper candidates from them, they take international students into consideration. STEM majors at any US university are constituted with a very large part of international students and a very small part of US students so that US needs international students to stay and prosper the tech companies.
