American students and workers need to become the focus of our government regulations, not foreign students. As a parent of a computer science degree student and wife of a high tech worker I am seeing our jobs disappear. Companies are laying off American workers for low cost foreign workers who are sending money out of our country. Students will have a hard time competing with these foreign workers as well! When are we going to start looking out for Anerican citizens? This has to be stopped! Until all of our citizens are employed, stop going our jobs to foreigners!
