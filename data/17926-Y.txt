I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.. 2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S..Many famous people who make great achievements in the U.S. used to international students. 3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.It is not international students who requiring low pay that eat American jobs. Those positions can not search for approaricate local employees. Competitions enable the U.S. to select more telanted individuals, which will improve the whole level of U.S.
