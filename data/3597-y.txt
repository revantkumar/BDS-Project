Shaoyuan Zhu Why not give well-educated international employee more opportunities to contribute to the United States than those without good education? No matter how, no one could stop the U.S. to be an open country. Less well-educated foreigners means more ill-educated ones. Unless we would be able to cut off America from outside world, which would leave all jobs to native American.
