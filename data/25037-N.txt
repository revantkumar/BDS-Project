There is no discussion about enforcement of the provision that guarantees that an American worker is not being replaced by a foreign worker. We have seen SCE and Disney illegally replace American workers with H1-B workers and the government has not stopped or reversed this crime. Enforcement of provisions that are supposed to protect the American worker are not being performed for political reasons. The companies should prove that there is a supposed labor shortage by showing first that they have actively looked for local workers.
