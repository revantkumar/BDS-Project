This proposed rule conveniently overlooks individuals that reside in the US illegally. Internal communications regarding this proposed rule reveals four options of varying expansiveness, with option 1 providing EADs to "all individuals living in the United States," including illegal aliens, visa-overstayers, and H-1B guest-workers, while option 4 provides EADs only to those on certain unexpired non-immigrant visas.

Giving EADs to any of the covered individuals, however, is in direct violation of Congress's Immigration & Nationality Act and works to dramatically subvert our carefully wrought visa system, hence is in and of itself - ILLEGAL.

Why does ICEB propose a rule that breaks the laws of the United States?
