First, DHS has NO authority whatsoever to make a "rule". A "rule" is not a law and has no legal binding authority whatsoever. This is not a board game, this is a constitutional republic. You bush league nazis doing the bidding or your corporate warlords like facebook and microsoft can go to hell.

As to the subject of this "rule", even if it was enacted as a law under the constitution it is wholly detrimental to native born and naturalized citizens currently employed in the STEM fields or those who will enter STEM fields in the future. They do not need more foreign competition, subsidized by THEIR OWN TAXES! Indeed, these foreigners do not have to pay into FICA or medicare taxes. This and many other programs just suppress wage growth, and coupled with the outrageous cost of education will make this country virtually devoid of native born STEM talent in the future if it continues. These foreign workers are by and large far less competent, less creative, and - though no fault of their own - unable to communicate effectively relative to their native born counterparts.

Why don't you scumbags go after your paymasters the federal reserve who have destroyed our labor market, our financial system, our medical industry, our educational system and our military through their money printing, state sanctioned monopolies, and predatory pricing? Too busy protecting the homeland? Catch that spy blimp of yours yet?
