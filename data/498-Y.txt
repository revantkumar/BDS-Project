Sean Shaw I strongly support this extension of OPT.
Obviously tt benefits the industry as well as the academic of the states.
But what will happen if this rule failed to pass?
The industry which heavily depends on the STEM students will sacrifice because less students will be working and stay here. The university will sacrifice, because losing the opportunity to work in the states will make the university or education in the states less attractive. So I think we'd better make sure this rule passes.
