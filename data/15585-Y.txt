As a international student who are studying in US as a CS master candidate, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1 The government should let the students who learned knowledge from US universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the US. Using their expertise gain on campus to constantly improve US even the world's technologies.

2 Diversity is very important for the US. That's why US has become the most powerful country on this planet. The more young intelligent students come here, the more successfully the US make around the world.

3 International STEM students bring culture, money, knowledge from their country investing them in US society. They bring and generate more than they gain from the US society.

We are the people who are complementary to US society helping more US citizen become better.
