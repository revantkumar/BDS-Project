Yifan Gu Some people against this OPT extention proposal with the argument of that "this would shadow H-1B program", or "OPT doesn't guarantee minimum wage/prevailing wage", thus "causing americans to lose their jobs in computer industrial". 

However I don't think this is a valid argument. First of all, It lacks data to support the argument, in fact, as far as I know, most OPT extention holder students are holding OPT because they failed the H1B lottery since the H1B cap can't fulfill the current industrial requirement for highly skilled employee. Thus the reality is most OPT extention holders DO MEET THE PREVAILING WAGE, otherwise how can their company file H1B application for them??

Besides, if the OPT extention proposal is rejected, how about the student who is in OPT extention already? Sending them back to their home country immediately?? According to the uscis [1]'s report, in 2015 alone, there are more than 175000 applications for H1B while at most only 85000 (general + advanced degree) will be fulfilled. Let's say only 30% of the remaining are OPT students, that would be more than 30000! What does that mean for the industrial to lose 30000 employees for no reason? IT MEANS A DISASTER! 

Take an example of my company, currently we have two employee who are in charge of an very important project. Unfortunately they didn't win the H1B lottery last year and this year, so now they are in OPT extention status. If OPT extention is cancelled, we have to send them abroad, which really increase our operation cost.

So as a person who have been through this broken H1B system, given that is't not gonna be fixed in a short term, OPT extention is now the only panacea, I hope the government to take this OPT extention petition seriously. Please think through it, please think about how bad it could be if the OPT extention is cancelled.
