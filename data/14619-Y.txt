I am convinced it would be a Win-win policy.

1. Longer OPT will make U.S education more attractive. Universities can attract more talent international students in STEM areas. These students get U.S educational resources. After they graduate, they should contribute to U.S STEM industry.

2. OPT never, and will not harm citizen's job market. OPT students are generally paid at least equally as American employees in STEM enterprises. As we know, companies have to pay more resources in hiring OPT students. But they would like to do so due to the lack of sufficient supply of qualified domestic talents.

3. What should be to blame is those Indian Outsourcing Company. They replace domestic workers with h1b workers who receive much lower payment. But it has nothing to do with OPT students!! International students are as well the victims of those Indian Outsourcing Company.

4. OPT strengthen American competitive edge and bilaterally beneficent for both American and non-American. Meanwhile, I think we need a rule that define clearly a prevailing wage requirement that is high enough to protect US workers and also protect rights of international students.
