Seriously, do you even see a college STEM degree citizen with good GPA and nice attitude lost his/her job in really life? 
Because his/her boss wants a foreign-accent in the office? 
Because his/her boss don't like smart guy doing IT stuff?
Because his/her boss don't like US hard working people?

I don't have a job so I blame other people!
We blame Mexico for illegal immigrates!
We blame Wall Street for messing up economy!
We blame China for low price products!
We blame our boss, competitors, colleagues who are still working for kicking us out of jobs!
And now we shall blame HSD for giving intern opportunity to high-tech students!
