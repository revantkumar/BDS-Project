I strongly accolade expanding STEM OPT extension. Why is that? 
STEM students would help stimulate US economy more than non STEM student. A prosperous economy is not just based on the trade and business, but also more important based on the scientific and engineering companies and high quality products. If there is no OPT extension for STEM students, they may end up going back to their home countries and help to boost their countries' economy. Countries like China and India have too many students pursuing higher education in the US. If we cancel the extension, less students would go to US for higher education. China and India's economy would keep growing fast and stable which are attracting more capitals and innovative minds from all over world. China, India and many developing country have vast population getting richer. The population is also the market that can consume more and more products everyday. What make US companies benefit from it by kicking the international students back to their home countries? 
We still believe US is a powerful country because it can contain ideas and all innovative minds from all over the world. Once the US decides to close the door to the world, it is the time for it to fail like China Qing Dynasty.
