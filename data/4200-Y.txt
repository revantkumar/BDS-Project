I definitely support the extension of OPT. It will have good affect both to F-1 students and America's economy. As a F-1 student, this extension will give me more opportunity to train my skill and gain experience. That is obvious. So I want to talk more about why this is good for America's economy.

Firstly, in IT companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, lots of employees are international students with F-1 OPT. They play an import part in America's IT industry. 
Secondly, international students contribute a lot money to America's college. We all know that international students pay more college tuition than native american's. Tuition from international students is a big part of college's income. Which will help America's colleges a lot. And international students are looking for training opportunity as much as class education. That is to say. If the extension does not pass, the number of international students who want to come to US university will reduce. Which is very bad for US universities. 

In all, I support OPT extension.
