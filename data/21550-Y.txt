I strongly support the extension of the OPT period for the F1 students with STEM degrees. Here are some reasons for that.

First of all, the extension will give students more time to improve themselves. We all know that school or universities can not teach you everything you need. Actually, students can only learn basic knowledge in class, especially for the ones with STEM degree. Students learn basic science concepts, equations, models etc in the class, and they need to go to industry to realize them. If there is no extension of the OPT period, students with F1 visa have to leave this country in 12 months, which is not fair for them.

Second, extended OPT period will not hurt the U.S job market. Actually, it benefits the job market a lot. It gives the employers more choices. On the other hand, this also stimulate the native students to improve themselves due to the competition from the international students.

Third, for this country, it is also good. International students always have to spend a lot of money, which actually create a lot of jobs for people. For example, restaurants, grocery stores, apartments, even airlines. I can not image that if all students have to leave in 12 months, how many students want to come here? They spend a lot of money and time, trying to improve themselves in this country. However, they have to leave without enough time to find a job. Then why not just stay in their own country? They will have better job opportunities if they do not come here. 

And there are a lot of other reasons. Hopefully this extension can be approved.
