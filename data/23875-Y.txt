Think about why U.S. can be the most powerful country in the World now?
Because of opening and liberty.
In the past three hundreds years, because of opening, America attracted lots of talented people.
Now some of American people just prevent those talent people enter U.S. If U.S. refuse more and more talent people, sooner or later U.S. will be over.
Lots of foreigners are making contributions to STEM in U.S.
It is fine if government refuse them and then they will just leave U.S., those talented people who make U.S. become the most powerful country will leave U.S., U.S. is done.
