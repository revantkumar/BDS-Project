I strongly support the STEM opt extension rule. It will make the US benefit more than the OPT extension students themselves. First of all, in practical, most of STEM students are graduate student with MS or PhD degrees, who are supported financially by the US, either NSF or other funding sources. They didn't spend any money, and in the meantime, they have salary to live in US for doing research and study. After graduation, it time for them to serve the society for the country, you don't want them to get back to where they come from without contribute anything to the US. Wake up, people, it not their fault that makes someone unemployed. If a US citizen have the similar background, he or she will never get unemployed. In other words, STEM students didn't take any positions away from US citizens, it is due to the demand of STEM graduates. Secondly, it will benefit company more, since the company can have more time to check the students' capabilities, and then decide whether support them for H1B or not. Thirdly, it will make more higher educated immigrants come and stay in the US not the illegal immigrants without any education, it the illegal immigrants who take the unemployed US citizen jobs, since they are doing lower level jobs and getting extremely pay. You always wish to have the most advanced skilled immigrants to boost your country, right? All in one, the proposed STEM OPT rule will benefit the country. I strongly support it.
