I think the rule is beneficial to U.S economy and labor markets. The STEM students fill in the labor demand in the tech market and research area that are valuable to U.S economy. The technology is the engine which drives the economy to strive, thus highly skilled STEM labors are needed. The reality is whether the native students can fill in the demand and fit the position with such skills. Most students prefer business major rather than science or engineering related majors. The reason I guess is STEM majors are harder. Therefore, The rule is able to let the companies and tech industry have enough candidates in the labor market and choose the skilled labor they want.
