Tim K I strongly support the proposed 24-month OPT extension program for STEM majors. First of all, It would be a shame if the U.S. turns away bright, talented foreign students who recently received advanced STEM degrees from our universities just because of our outdated immigration regulations. The U.S. needs to continue making effort to develop advanced technologies and inventions in order to reinforce its stand as a world power. Without an updated OPT regulation and immigration policy in place favoring foreign STEM scholars, many talented students, scientists and researchers would be forced to return to their home country and compete against the U.S., and would therefore seriously jeopardize our country's interest to lead the world in the field of STEM research.

On the other hand, while immigration control is definitely needed to prevent the influx of unskilled foreign labor into the U.S., we need to put things in perspective and implement immigration rules that welcome skilled foreign personnel with advanced degrees to the U.S. so that they may positively contribute to the nation's technological development, create new jobs opportunities and business interests through their research, and work with our own scholars to strengthen our country's power. 

Don't forget that our country was built upon immeasurable amount of diligence, sacrifice and determination of immigrants from all over the world; it would be such a shame if our country's prospects are hindered just because of unfounded prejudice against those foreign talents who may bring about tremendous value to our country in the future.
