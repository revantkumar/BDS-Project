This is a blatant disregard for the plight of American workers who are harmed by excessive immigration. OPT bends the rules for a few highly-qualified foreign students. According to the Government Accountability Office, about 100,000 foreign graduates a year are awarded OPT status (about 20,000 with the STEM extension) and then go on to compete with similarly qualified American job seekers.

The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. 

Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. 

This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
