Leading IT corporations needs international students to work for them after their graduation. Without the 24 month STEM extension, they would have to leave the country and the corporation if they couldn't get H1b visa during their one-year standard OPT time. It would cause a big loss to corporations like Google and Facebook, making them become less competitive to similar companies outside the US. If this happens, more Americans may lose their job due to the possible shutdown of these large companies.
