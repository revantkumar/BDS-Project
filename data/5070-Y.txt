Chi Huang I strongly agree with the OPT expanding for F-1 STEM students. 

First of all, International students contribute a lot for US GDP, including the tuition, the rental, all the other expanse. This also bring lots of opportunities for the local citizen. As quote from DHS. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion). 

Secondly, most research program lasts at least 2 years, For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) typically funds projects through grants that last for up to three years. And in many fields such as mathematics, computer science, and the social sciences, NSF is the major source of federal funding. As a computer engineering student, I can tell most of our project need to be done 2 or 3 years. These research would be terminated if there is no STEM OPT extension.

Some citizen may think extension the STEM OPT may lower the rate of employment for US citizen. This is totally wrong. As DHS mentioned in the proposal clearly, only those company with e-verify can apply for the OPT extension, which means these company are equal to all the employees, not matter citizen or non-citizen. As long as you are skilled, then you will be hired. Most of the jobless citizen they are not qualified for the position. This is not due to STEM OPT extension. This is due to themselves! If they can put half effort as the F-1 student do. They should as skilled as these F-1 student! The priority goal of company is making profit, of course they know who is more skilled.
