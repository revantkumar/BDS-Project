I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. The government should give international students who learn knowledge from U.S. University equally chances to keep their jobs so they can use what they learn to from this country to pursue their dreams or career and even make more contributions to the U.S. The competition always exist and because of those competitions, the country has more investments and rapidly growth economics. At the same time, more international workers can give some companies more perspectives and their own international advantages are very important for some enterprise especially for some big international Enterprises. As we all know, if this proposal pass, American students and workers will feel more pressure. However, pressure is good. Think about it, college students would like spend more time on their study and try to be more creativity, and American workers will work harder and more efficient. This is a fast developing society, the one who does the better job deserves more chances. Some American against this proposal because they think international students take the jobs belong to them. I do not think that's true. Cause even tough there is no extension for STEM major students, people who do not have that skills and qualities still cannot find job. THE KEY TO FIND A JOB is a person's ability not the government policy and not what nationality you are. However, the government policy DOES CAN KEEP THE TALENTED PEOPLE TO WORK FOR THEM IN ORDER TO MAKING CONTRIBUTION TO THE U.S. No country does not love talented people. The U.S. is democracy and smart, so I do believe the government will give a fare platform to all talent people and give self a chance to keep more talented people.
