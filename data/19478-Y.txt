I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Foreigners contributed a lot to US development. Needless to say US is a diversity country itself.

3. More people from foreign country can improve positive competitions in the market.
