I strongly support the proposal. Mu reasons are listed as follows:

Many international students have studied at universities in US and would like to live in US in the future and make contributions to this country. Giving them this opportunity will benefit both sides. I believe these students will work hard to serve United States. Especially most of the students are highly-talented.

Another reason is that diversity is very important to US. Based on my learning experience in US, students with different cultural background usually have various ideas and can always accomplish greater success if they work and learn together.

Some people may concern that this will bring fierce competition to their lives. However, it is not a bad thing to have competition. It helps this nation to improve faster. People always want to get into better high schools, better universities and better companies. Of course better environment means more competition, but competitions make us improve faster.

For the reasons above, I support the proposal and hope that authorities make the best decision for the nation.
