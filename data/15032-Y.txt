I strongly oppose to this rule,

1. This rule will help the non backlogged countries. i.e. it will directly impact people from Over populated Asian countries like India and China. STEAM student from Non-Backlogged countries can apply for extended 24 month OPT and in the process of 36 months, employer can file PERM, I140 and their priority date will be current, So Employer can retain the employee after 3 years hence Employers will prefer people from Non Backlogged countries as the investment they made on recruiting and training freshers wont go waste. On the other hand, STEM students from countries like India and China has to wait for 10 to 15 years to have the Priority date to current and non-availability of enough H1 visas will force students to return back after 36 month of OPT, so there is high possibility that employer wont prefer the students from India and China. So this rule will favor only students from non backlogged countries.

2. 36 months without paying SSN tax or any other tax benefits will impact US economy. 

3.Some bad employers can use OPT students for really cheap labor..
