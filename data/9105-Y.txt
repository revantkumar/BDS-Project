The gate for introducing talented students and skilled workers shall never be closed. The United States of America had become a country like today, not because of its wealth, but the people that make the wealth, people that come from places all over the world, share their ideas, create wonderful lives. So please keep the source of the American spirit alive by keeping the OPT for the students.
