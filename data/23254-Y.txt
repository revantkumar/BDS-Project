This is a good initiative for F1- Students as it benefits the students who are seeking opportunities in US, which in turn enhances the economy.US needs a larger tech-savvy workforce to maximize economic growth. At rate of $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving ( Total $80000000000.00) will go other countries with OPT system. US Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months. Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by paying the Taxes on their employment ( 3 Years x $3000 per year x 400000 students= Total $ 3600000000.00). This rule attracts more individuals to come to US for education and there by exploring and contributing knowledge in the field of science and technology. I hope people to see this rule as a part that enhances the growth of the country with knowledge.
