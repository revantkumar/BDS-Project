The new rule put forward by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) comes as a great move to make an improvement towards the F1 STEM OPT program. Often students under the F1 category have a very minimal time to contribute their skills and expertise which they have gained through their academic courses. This will definitely help employers and students to improve innovation and progress the nation's economy and intellectual property. In my opinion, Students (International or Domestic) are the real talent that we need right now to foster continuous innovation more than anything else. 

Thus, Extending the OPT period is a great move by the government and I support this new rule to be published to avoid a huge impact for employers, students and the educational ecosystem.
