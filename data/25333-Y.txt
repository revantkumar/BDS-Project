Many of my friends graduated last year and start new companies in Bay Area, they recruit a lot of native American people, co-founder, sales manager etc. I believe working or creating a startup in our OPT duration is highly likely to bring about more job opportunities to American, and I believe this will make a more prosperous USA.
