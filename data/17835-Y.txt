I strongly agree with this proposal. Simply speaking, this will ensure the students can have the time to practice what they have learnt at school, which can make the US economy prosper based on the recent year progress in this area, especially IT industries. You cannot deny the contribution from these F-1 Students. Without them, the US cannot get back from the financial crisis so quickly and easily. I really hope this proposal can be passed, which will definitely be good for both the US and those F-1 Students.
