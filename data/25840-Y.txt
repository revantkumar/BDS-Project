I really thank the DHS for this opportunity to submit my comment on this proposed rule. Lots of reports and studies concluded that immigrant scientist and engineers were creating new jobs for USA. The job market isn't a Zero-Sum Game. I applaud your efforts. 

Moreover, what I concern about is whether the DHS have any interim rule to save the students facing STEM OPT Extension about to expire. Our company is a High-Tech company which is a global leader in Microwave Signal Processing Products & Telecommunication components. My two co-workers from Italy were not selected in H1B Visa Lottery of this year. One's STEM OPT Extension has expired and has no other choice but to leave. The other's STEM OPT Extension is expiring very soon. They graduated from the best engineering schools in Italy and are very talented engineers.

On average, our company takes more than half a year to find a qualified person and trains him/her in the first half of the year. Their leaving causes big economic and time losses. 

I urge the DHS to approve the rule and put into effect at the earliest, and hope the DHS have some interim rule to help the students facing STEM OPT Extension about to expire. They may use the remaining 7 months and have another chance to participate in H1B Visa Lottery of next year.
