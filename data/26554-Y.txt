I strongly SUPPORT for the following reasons:

1. In the time period of OPT, foreign students could contribute to the US economy by utilizing their knowledge acquired from US institutions. 

2. Diversity is a symbol of United States. The OPT extension allows more time for foreign students to bring their culture background into the broad community. 

3. Quite a lot of foreign students in STEM field are competitive and hardworking intellectuals. Their intellectual contributions can potentially inspire US residents about their working and living styles.
