Deyu Du There are so many foreigners played the important distribution for the development of the United States such as Albert Einstein. By comparison, other countries such as Japan and Germany offer better refunds to attract the STEM talents. People should keep a wider and prolonger perspective. For example, becomes of competition from the Japanese cars, the workers in Detroit protested for the decrease of salaries. In order to keep the production working, companies still offer the prior salaries. It seems that workers are the winners. However, realities showed that both of workers and companies lost everything. Even Detroit nearly passed away. Protestors should think about the prolong interests. If the United States were to develop slower than before, social welfare would decreased a lot and living standards would go BACK LAST CENTURY!
