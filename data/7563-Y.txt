Nathan Gong In 19th century, first group of Asian immigrants came to American,seeking for better lives and freedom. They worked in mines, laundry rooms and restaurants. America gave them their chances and they did great jobs in return. However, being afraid of that Asian immigrants would take all their jobs, white people became costive and treated those industrious immigrants with the most inequality that can ever happen in this world. Workers were forced to pay large amount of tax that made them could not keep living in this beaulitiful country, and Asian women had no choice but becoming postitutes in order to maintain themselves. All the notorious actions you can name made American the hell instead of heaven for immigrants, and for a long time when talking about American in Asian country, all the thing that people would think is that people in this country are costive and unfriendly. Many years have passed, the open policies have made America becoming a heaven for immigrants again, and many forigen people with great talents are more than willing to go to America to work. Some of them won the Nobel prize for America and some of them became the main force in the area of technology. Now the same kind of people are trying to use the same reason to make America the hell for the immigrants again! Don't forget that America is an immigrant country! Don't forget the only native is Indian! Don't forget Einstein is an immigrant and all the great achievements made by immigrant! Let's not repeat the history and make the same mistake!
