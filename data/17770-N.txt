There should NOT be any expansion of the OPT program. It is incorrect to allege there would be no impact were 
the OPT program to be expanded. The proposed expansion, in effect, would favor non-citizens over U.S. citizens. 
This is a negative effect. The longer a non-citizen works in the U.S. under the OPT program, the greater the 
potential for that OPT-employed person to gather more information, skills, and experience to ultimately put to work 
for a foreign company or government in competition with U.S, companies, or in opposition to U.S. companies or the
U.S. as a country. An expansion of the OPT program is not in the national interest of the United States.
