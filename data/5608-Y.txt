I strongly support this rule. As we can see, the international students have already made a lot of contributions to the development of this country, especially in the area of science, such as prof. Jinquan Yu in Scripps. Some of the comments said the OPT made it worse for the citizens to hunting for a job. If it is true, that is because those people are afraid of competence and they are not strong enough. Also, they should know they are not just competing with the international students working in the U.S. but they are competing with those people worldwide. Also, some comments said they didn't spend such a long time on training. Actually, they don't know for most of the STEM international students, they don't the chance to do the inter before they finish their PhD or other degrees. However, for them, they have more time and more chances to get trained during their studying program. Last, a lot of companies will move to other countries as the wage goes up if the government stops the STEM and that will become nightmare. Finally, I back up this rule to be passed.
