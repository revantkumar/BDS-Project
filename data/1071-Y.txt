A sign of a country's degeneration starting from try to shut the door and strangle competition. US is a country open to the world and welcome all the talent and genius to make contribution to the society, that is why so many brilliant international students try hard to be admitted into a US university. Even though they pay their own tuition fee and living expense, won't you feel a loss when you see they gained knowledge and technique from US and just leave the country? Or even they get a half year or 10-month training and work for the company for two month and leave the country? However, they have a 24 month OPT extension, they will be able to contribute another 24 month working and devoting their value. By allowing STEM students to stay longer, US will benefit from their talent and creation during these 2 years especially when they are ready and contribute.

No extension will reduce the competition. Please remember that international student who are able to find jobs are already best of the best among their peers when lots of other international students who tried but failed to get one. So grace period is like filter, keep the better stay; an extension is just make the more of the contribution leave to the US other than goes back to other country.
