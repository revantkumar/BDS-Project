Amelia M. I have 2 new colleagues who just graduated this summer. One from India and one from China. I have to say, they are really nice people. They are friendly, smart and diligent. Our team like them very much. To be honest, not many Americans know that these international students have paid so much to study here. Before meeting them, I never know F1 students have a limited time to work in US (If their OPT expires, they must leave America) and that H1B lottery. Many international students, like my colleagues, are very promising and hard-working people. It is beneficial to keep them in our country and help build the industry. They are able to do good or even better job compared with some lazy citizens. There's no doubt that we would like to hire and work with these excellent young people. I don't know why some people want to prevent our country from growing. We already have a heavy burden to bare low income people. If we let these well educated people go back to contribute their own country, it would be a great loss to our country.
