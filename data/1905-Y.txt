The extension of OPT Stem from 17 months to 24 months seems very appropriate and highly recommended. However, I see issues with some of it. Like for example my OPT STEM is valid from Jan 11 to June 11 of the next year under the 17 month current OPT STEM Extension rule and with the new proposed 24 months it will be extended from June to January. With this students like me will not be eligible for H1B filing which is due April 1. I would recommend extending the OPT STEM from 24 months to 30 months which will allow lots of students atleast 3 chances of H1B filing which is in itself very competitive.
