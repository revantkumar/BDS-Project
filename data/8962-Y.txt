I support OPT STEM extension, based on the following reasons. 
First, these people are smart, hardworking people, and are really trying to make our country better. One year is such a short time, many of them just started to work and has not achieved anything yet. Without an extension, they won't be able to work in this country, which is definitely a loss of talent.
Second, science is aways a boost of production, and these STEM students are high level educated scientists and engineers, every companies can benefit from these young and energetic students.
