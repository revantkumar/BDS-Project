I strongly support this proposal.

Speaking from the perspective of a scientist in high-tech startup industry, US need a large tech-savvy workforce to maximize economic growth, to keep the competitive edge over other countries. Many start-ups rely on the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments otherwise relying on obsolete technologies. Many companies who are at the center of innovation, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, need a large work force of well-trained STEM students.

As mentioned in multiple media reports (eg. White House reports addressing high-tech workers), STEM students help grow the economy and create jobs.

The 24-month extension is necessary because time needed for proper training in the high-tech industry will be take a long time. It hurts the industry if the students were forced to leave the country in the middle of the training. High-tech works are so specialized that it is hard for others to step in quickly and push the progress as fast.

The new rule proposed will help that it will not affect any US based existing employees as they are covered under the provisions of new rule protects their interests.
