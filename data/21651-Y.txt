As we all know, F1 non-immigration students has contributed a lot to the economic boom in US. They are highly active in the job market especially in the aspect of engineerings. You can see so many non-immigration students working in high-tech places like Seattle, Bay areas...etc. They are both intelligent and work very hard. Without their hard work, how could our country keep prosperous especially in technology?If we Americans couldn't even accept these kind of gifted people, I think our country will go die soon! Look at China, the world's second largest economy, grow so fast that it reaches these achievements within 30 years. Why this could happen? Because they braces the talents. They always try their best to persuade those highly educated people to reside in China. They even give them much much more rewards than we Americans can imagine. Reversely, what we are now trying to do is to exclude those people. That's a pity for the whole country. Believe me or not, the high-tech companies and our country's economy will undergo a fatal hit if we do not pass this regulation.
