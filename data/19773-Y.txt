I believe it is essential for the government to maximize the economic capacity for our nation. As part of the crucial workforce, STEM students, who are eligible in technology skills, will help to produce, create and innovate. Their help in technology advancement is immeasurable. If STEM OPT is cancelled, thousands of foreign scientists and engineers will be sent to their home nation. It will be a huge loss of talents and innovations for our nation, which leads to a huge loss for our economy.
