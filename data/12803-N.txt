I strongly oppose the Optional Practical Training Program. It has been distorted into a program that discriminates against US citizens in favor of people from other countries.

As explained by Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa (in a letter to President Obama):

"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."
