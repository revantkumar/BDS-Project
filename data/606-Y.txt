I strongly agree with the longer extension of STEM OPT. Longer legal stay in US for F1 students are super important for both students and US tech companies. We have been the driving force for tech companies, and it will be unfair if we keep worrying about our VISA status every day given the current immigration laws. 

Stricter immigration laws should be applied to illegal / lower education level illegal immigrates.
