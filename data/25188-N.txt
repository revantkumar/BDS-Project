Your sworn duty is to AMERICANS. NOT FOREIGNERS. Everything the DHS does is adversarial to Americans, while at the same time it gives special treatment to foreigners. You are either on our side or theirs. Americans are the people who pay your salaries - you owe US - not foreign workers. Do the job you are being paid to do which is to protect Americans, not destroy us.
