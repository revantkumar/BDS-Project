I support improving and expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees. All other countries are trying their best to complete with our country currently. Why we send high-qualified "Made in USA" students to them, but not let these students contribute to USA? We need more STEM students to build America! There are not enough STEM workers in America at all.
