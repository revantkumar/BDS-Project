The newly proposed rule will provide an equal opportunity to work in this country after their study. The university has spent a lot of money to teach them knowledge and skills. It doesn't make sense to ask them to leave without making contribution to the economy. I have college friends who are from foreign countries like Germany, Brazil, and etc. I feel like they're all very smart and activated people and would love to stay in this country after their study by gaining some work experience. I think the new rule would be beneficial for both sides, the US and the students. In sum, I support the new rule.
