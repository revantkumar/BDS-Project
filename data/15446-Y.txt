Stem OPT will provide both international students on working opportunities in the US and benefit to the companies. As economic environment in the US is recovering from 2008 financial crisis, there is an increasing demand in the labor market. Stem OPT will not only solve this problem for the government, but also benefit the companies involved. So I highly support this regulation and hope that US can look to the big picture and the future prosperity of the United States.
