I strongly advocate the proposal on the following grounds. 

1. Immigration status should not be a primary barrier for international students to apply and practice what they learned during their academic programs. After years of school in U.S., international students deserve a chance to practice their professional training. Their legal status is the problem preventing them from utilizing their knowledge to make contributes. 

2. New proposal will provide benefits to not only international students, but more importantly, the U.S. economy. As international students, they can contribute equally to the U.S. economy as U.S. citizens. And due to their professional training, international students can meet special needs in various areas. 

3. Giving extensions of OPT to international students is not taking away employment opportunities from U.S. citizens. International students under OPT have to been employed within their academic fields. This will mutually exclude the possibility of seizing working opportunity from U.S. citizens. International students can boost the U.S. economy along side with all the other people in different kinds of professional field.
