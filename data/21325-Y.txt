I strongly support OPT extension program. The smart aliens play quite important roles in the Silicon Valley. They contribute to the America and bring the benefit to it. Why should the government refuse them? Refusing smart aliens do not help the rate of unemployment! Instead, it may reduce the creativity in the development of America!
