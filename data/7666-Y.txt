Miranda Zhu I strongly supported the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The proposal gives international students who used the education sources in US to contribute back to the society. 
2. The proposal can attract more international students to come to US to create a diversity environment for society growth
3. Competition is everywhere in current century. It's better to have more talents to compete to each other to find the most
useful sources for US.
