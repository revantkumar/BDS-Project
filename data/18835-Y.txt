Since most of the top students around me from my high school and college are now studying abroad or using OPT to work in America, I do think this new rule will keep most of the elites all around the world working in USA and better contribute to the economic.

I strongly recommend that in the future, OPT students who already find a job in USA can apply for the Green card without the painful H1B process.
