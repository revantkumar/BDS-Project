I support this rule. It is both good for student and company in US. Some people might have concern about unemployment rate for US natives. But actually, those unemployed people will not be qualified for STEM position which need high-level education and rich experience. So by restricting STEM extension, unemployment in US cannot be relived, but also it is harmful for US IT industry and other STEM industry.
