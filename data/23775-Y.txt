It is only fair to everybody to expand the opt for STEM students. First of all, OPT students worked hard to graduate. They should be given the chance to experience what they have learned in school, and this is actually beneficial to schools and industries as well, a complete system would lead this into a rational cycle. Otherwise, the whole international education system would be in trouble sooner or later. Also, they are not in fact competitive enough comparing with residents, most employers do prefer residents or sometimes at least green card holders, so there's no threat to residents at all. After all, for some fileds as IT or EE, employers could not find enough employees with green card or nationality, these OPT students would work well and is kind of needed under this condition, this would keep these industries functioning well and making contributions still. This is what STEM and OPT is all about from the very beginning! Now that it's good to everyone, why not extending the OPT for STEM students!
