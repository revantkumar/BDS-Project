Being a student who took a large amount of loan to pursue the dreams of doing a Masters degree in a country like USA which provides high quality education, I know the importance of this rule. One year is not enough time to repay the loan. It will leave me in a very difficult economic situation when I return back to my country. Extending the OPT STEM duration by 24 months will help me repay loan as well as gain exposure in my field of study. This exposure will help me a lot in my career.
