Dear US government representatives:
I want to express options about this purposal. I strongly agree with this idea. This idea has deeply rooted in my heart. 
I have stayed in US for about 3 years and during this unforgetable period of time, I was deeply impressed by this country's high level civilization, This comes from both society's highly technology and individual's great quality. I have thought about for a long time what has contributed to prosperity of this country, and then it occured to me just one word: DIVERSITY. 

Yes, three years staying in America has alreay taught me that this country is willing to accept people from all kinds of places. As long as they have their own unique skills, innovation, this country can and are glad to accpet them. This is called America dream, a dream that deeply rooted in every alien's mind that here, opportunities are equal to them. Here, by using their own abilities, innovation, by working hard and communicate well with other people, they can get success. 

F1 students are such those potential people. One one hand, they learn new things, on the other hand, they are quite intelligent, hardworking and are willing to make their own contributions to this development.

Histroy in the past has already proved this is true. It has already proved that encouraging qualified people will bring great benefits to this country. 

Some may disagree that it will disturbe the local economy because less native american can get job. However, they fail to see that those jobs find it hard to find native people to work on. In this case, why not taking good advantages of Alien ? This will make the US a truely global factory and be in the competitive position for long time.
