This is absolutely great. The benefits are obvious.

* Hiring international students are expensive. But why companies keep hiring international students in such a case? 
- CEOs are not stupid. Though hiring an international student might be expensive than hiring a domestic student, the value that they create in the future has great difference. International students can create more values. This is good for companies in the U.S.
- So, if the company can gain more profit, the company will expand. Thus more positions will be opened. And this is absolutely great for the U.S. citizens.
- No offence, but since international students are serious about working in the U.S., thus usually they will do more and better than the domestic students.

* If there's no OPT extension, companies in the U.S. will be influenced.
- Companies in the U.S. will be influenced if there's no OPT extension. Especially those startups that hire more international students.
- If there's no extension, then these international students will need to get back to their home country. And, the startup need to spend more time to find suitable candidates, which is not only time-consuming, but also money-consuming.
- And, these talented students will get back to similar companies in their home countries, which are usually the competitors of these U.S. companies. This means, the competitors will get stronger, while the U.S. companies will get weaker.
- This means, the stock of these companies will fall, and they will have to fire people to save the money it spent, which is also bad for the U.S. citizens that do not have to worry about the OPT extension.
