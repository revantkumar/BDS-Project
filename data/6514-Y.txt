James Lee I definitely support STEM OPT extension. This will provide the students to get exposed to the real world working culture and will help them gain real time knowledge. Some problems in IT can be solved with the wide availability of these well educated and fresh graduates. The Billion dollar industries has more advantage with this and this will give the real meaning to the land of opportunities. It not only help the companies but would also help economy to boost.
