Probably what I'm saying is a little biased because I'm in my opt now. But I think this policy will be a win-win, for both the US economy and us. Remember OPT extension applies to STEM graduates, who are assets in any country in the world. In the long run, the skill and knowledge we have will only help to create more jobs, rather than consume them.
