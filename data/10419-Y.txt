We do need OPT extension. People come to the US from all over the world to bring their values to the US. Why do we ever consider restricting them to do so? They are not "stealing" jobs from Americans. They are not paid less. They get paid just as much as any American worker at the same position. It's not the nationality or "less pay" that gets you the job, it's how skilled you are that really matters.
