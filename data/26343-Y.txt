I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 
As an international student from china, I really appreciate the good education offered for us. But on another hand, we really come here not just for pursing knowledge, but to purse our american dream, the dream that can work here and gain more experiences, and contribute to this country as a paying back gift. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also reasonable. Based on my experiences, most of the projects in industry need at least 2 years to finish. If the time is too short, it is also a pain for companies who hired those international student.

I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents. And I guess that is also a big goal of US higher education.

I really hope this new extension could be passed from the bottom of my heart. I guess there a number of hardworking international students dreaming about this.
