I totally support the new policy.
The body of foreign students with degrees in STEM is a crucial part of US economics. They are usually the elites in their own countries (so the excellence of foreign students has its own economic value).
This updated policy which extends OPT stay to 24 months will create huge economic benefits for the country considering there are a great number of graduates with F1 visas in outstanding companies like Google, Facebook and so on. 
In the book "Exceptional People: How Migrant Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future" written by Ian Goldin, the director of Oxford University's Martin School, he stated that 52% of start companies in Silicon Valley from 1995 to 2004 that has at least one immigrant founder. And if the US provides less chance for F1 students with STEM degrees to stay in the country, it can greatly endanger the diversity of workers in Silicon Valley and thus jeopardize the Silicon Valley culture, which then negatively affects the innovation level of the currently most innovative country in the world.
To conclude, I believe this policy is great, for the benefits of foreign students in US and more importantly for the country itself.
