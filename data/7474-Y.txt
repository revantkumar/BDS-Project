This is a meaningful improvement on the existing rule in the right direction, increasing flexibility and improving competition for employees and stability for employers (who can now have less concerns of losing valuable employees to the vagaries of the H1 lottery).

Whole-heartedly looking forward to the implementation of these changes.!

Thank You,
