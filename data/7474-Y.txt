Larry Davis You must really hate the American people! Another attack on the jobs available for American workers. Our manufacturing jobs are all but gone because of this fantasy called FREE TRADE, you won't protect our own borders or enforce our immigration laws, more jobs lost. And now this. Is our Federal Government totally owned and controlled by Big Business? Doesn't the future of young people in this country matter anymore?
