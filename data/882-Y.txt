I support this OPT extension.
After I read comments, A straight question. Are these 90 million Americans looking for jobs in STEM field ? I seriously doubt. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, international Students Outpace Americans in STEM Degrees. So please do not say that International student take away opportunities. I would like to say more competition more better performance.
