As a student currently on OPT, I feel this proposal to extend STEM to 2 years will be very invaluable to both the students and the employers. The experience and knowledge gained through OPT and STEM is very much needed after the university education to better prepare the student's transition into the workplace with the desired skills in STEM fields. 
I urge the rule to be passed in favor of students and the employers who invested time and resources into training.
