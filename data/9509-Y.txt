Personally, it is a good decision for all STEM students to gain experience in practical world as well as contributing to the American economic development. 
Some people argue that it impacts the job opportunities of American. I don't agree. First, Dollar is losing its dominant position for the increasing strength of concurrency of China and so on. American needs industry to recover from the current weak economic status. Also be impacted by QE, other countries realize that their wealth is grape by American. American need more export to confirm its position as a super country around the world. In this circumstance, there aren't a lot of American with engineering skills but the country needs. STEM students help a lot and contribute the recover of American industry. Also, they get three years experience in American which is good for both sides. 
In summery, it is a good decision for American as well as foreign students.
