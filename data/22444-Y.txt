I support this proposal that can offer extended work opportunities for STEM degree holders. My main reasons are as follows: 

First,to guarantee enough practional training time is to uphold the value of science and technology. Without an option for the application of scientific knowledge to the society, many foreign college students in the STEM area will be inevitably discouraged, while American universities rely on the academic competitiveness driven by those students. 

Second, huge gaps of technician shortages still exist, and IT firms all over the country is hungry for qualifying prospective employees. IT companies are extremely productive and important to the nation's economic recovery. On most of the job bulletin boards over the internet sites, employers would indicate that candidates must have work authorization without them sponsoring anything, so canceling the OPT extension will definitely create a worsening brain drain for America's industries. 

Last but not least, every person living on the sacred land of USA should enjoy equal rights to live, work, and strive for happiness, the same should apply to young graduates regardless of countries of origin. Great people who are active in IT in USA were not all born here, such as SpaceX and TeslaMotors CEO Elon Musk who is from South Africa, and as an UPenn alumnus he has created more revenue and job opportunities for the U.S. To sum up, give the STEM kids a chance, they will be useful in the future.
