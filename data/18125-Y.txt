Firstly, I completely support expanding the OPT STEM Extension from 17 to 24 months because any student whether an American or an international student who graduate from US Institutions struggle hard during their research work/ Thesis/ Lab/ Course work to earn the bunch of Technical knowledge and they really need sufficient time to get trained as per the corporate standards, apply their skill practically and benefit both technical firms and the nation's economy. Secondly, I do not think 17 months would be enough for a student to turn out as a valuable professional for the society and definitely need some more time to continue their practical work and apply their talent in developing America. I feel Introducing this bill doesn't prioritize the foreign workers over American born because foreign workers are given limited time to start up their career in their fields of study with so many clauses like there should not be any unemployment more than 120 days during the whole OPT period and etc. If the Student doesn't have the real skill, he/she cannot comply with the OPT rules, his/her work permit would be terminated and probably he/she would be out of the bracket. We can draw a conclusion from the previous sentence that DHS has already drafted a set of rules such that they only preserve the skilled foreign workers, but not the scrap. Thirdly, The president Obama said "America is formed by large group of immigrants from Europe and other parts of the world long ago and would be empty if they are kicked out". I strongly agree with the president and say that my family/your family/all the families are once an immigrants long ago and America would not grow as a Top nation if we would have build the walls and kicked them out. If there is a real need to turn it down this bill, I appeal DHS to do something legally to not to kick off the current STEM graduates who are on STEM OPT Extension and may apply for the prospective students with prior notice.Finally, I appreciate DHS in br
