This is a great initiative. 

Firstly this will eliminate fraud. OPT students are depending on employers who have to sponser H1. Employers make use of this situation and fraud the system. The proposed rule will give the OPT students to stand themselves and be on a strong foot. 

Secondly, this will be great benefit for Universities. Students around the world would be encourged by this rule and throng US univercities. Remember they are paying high out-of-state fees. that means lot of money for the universities. they can spend the money on infrasturcture and R&D. Thus benefitting US to stay ahead of others in technology. 

Thridly, reputed employrs find it easy to hire the talented individuals without worrying about visa hurdles.

All the way, its a win-win for US as well as students.
