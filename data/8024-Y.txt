I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. Accepting and welcoming people from all over the world is the reason the makes the. U.S. so great today.

2. If, the OPT extension was revoked. The U.S. will lose thousands of engineers and scientists. They are actually the base that support the development of various high-tech industries of the U.S.

3. The high-tech industry is actually transferring from the U.S. to asia. If the U.S. does not increase its attractiveness to the future scientists or engineers and even kick them away. I believe the U.S. may be lose its leading space very soon.
