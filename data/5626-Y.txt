Lucy Duan I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. More importantly, the extension will allow international students who are already employed at U.S. companies and non-profit organizations to continue their contribution to their organizations and communities without having to face abrupt interruptions and/or constant uncertainty. By providing this extension, firms in the U.S. will have greater freedom to seek and retain the best talent without being inhibited by immigration status. Students, in turn, will also have greater freedom to discover and pursue their best path possible and truly apply themselves in university and beyond. This extension (and other efforts similar to it) will benefit students, employers, the economy, the communities that we have built and grown to cherish, and civil society as a whole.
