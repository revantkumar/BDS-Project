The OPT extension will bring more valuable talents to USA and enable them to work for USA. Some people say the international students are stealing their jobs, but actually they are not! These international students are smart and hardworking, they can do good job on computer programming and business analysis, the job market need them, the technology company need them, it's the booming economy which require them to stay, not they want to steal fortune from USA. If some USA citizen are not qualified for the job, they should NOT get the job, they have no reason to blame the international student. Actually, lots of companies does not hire international student, just because of the visa status, will the discommemder regard this as bias to international student? Therefore the OPT extension is totally fair, otherwise the discrimination will long live and do harm to USA.
