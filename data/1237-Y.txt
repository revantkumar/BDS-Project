Martin Terry I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. On one side, US tech companies rely on international students to create values for their companies, which bring more revenue and then be converted to tax for IRS. And this tax would benefit each US citizens here. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry.

After clearing the common misconceptions, it is worth mentioning that the proposed new rule benefits U.S. people. As mentioned in the study done by NAFSA, foreign students consistently contribute tremendously amount of money to the U.S. economy. In the 2013-2014 academic year, they made a net contribution of 26.8 billion USD, including tuition and living expenses. The incentives that drive foreign students to come to U.S. for further study are not only better education opportunities, but also a more promising career. With the help of STEM OPT, foreign students can develop their professional skills in world-renowned high-tech companies after graduation. 
To sum up, STEM OPT will not steal job opportunities from U.S. citizens, nor will it lower the welfare of U.S. workers. On the contrary, this new rule is proposed to protect U.S. citizens and bring fortune and brainpower to the States.
