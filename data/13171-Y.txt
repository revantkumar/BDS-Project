I strongly support the proposed STEM OPT extension policy. 

As a STEM student who is currently under F1-OPT, I am working as a postdoc researcher in a top university in US. Before I came to US, I also have options to purse my PhD degree in Canada and Europe. One major reason I choose to study in US is that I have the flexibility to keep doing research in US after graduation thanks to the original STEM OPT extension policy. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country. 

If this rule is terminated by some reasons, it would be a disaster for STEM research in US since a large portion of PhD student and postdoc researchers who are doing cutting-edge research are from foreign countries. Many of current STEM researcher would have to leave the country immediately and their on-going research would be halted. It would also be a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from the universities in US and let them keep making contributions to the country.
