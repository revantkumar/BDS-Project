Rose Sun As a foreign student, actually when we at school, we already contribute a lot for the society. Since the tuition fee is more than natives. Most of our purposes for OPT may not for trying to get a American identity, actually, the aims for OPT extension are varies. I think many student just like me, may only want to get some work experience in America. If some people try to stop us to work here, some student may not want to study in america. So there will be less tuition fees to society.
I totally disagree with cancellation of OPT extension.
