When I considered study aboard, the STEM OPT expanding policy in US is a big reason that I prefer america rather than Europe or Asia. Because two years professional training in US is a big advantage for me when I come back to home, I will have more experience working in advanced country. Employers in my home town prefer to hire people who have experience working in US instead of a new grad or junior worker who just get a degree here.
