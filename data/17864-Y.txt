I'M Abdel Mostafa, US citizen, I was self motivated to migrate to America after I resigned from my position working as consultant urology surgeon for 20 years and head of the urology department for 10 years at Dubai central hospital, UAE and they NEVER offered me permanent residency or citizen to encourage me to continue me and my wife life there.Then I got offer to work director and research associate in institute of education and research in Virginia,since then started my journey to my dreaming home in the best democratic country in the world as professional immigrant to USA. Me and my wife got our citizen after 10 years. 
I Believe that we need during this time until the immigrant students to get their improving and expanding training opportunities, to do our best to support them through two life style levels, 
1- socially we need to be sure that they have comfortable independent living place to help them to focus more on their goal
to achieve best grades. 
2- We need to develop periodic personal communication with them on individual or group basis to take care of their mood issues like anxiety, violence, depression, lack of self motivation, limited life skills, self esteem problems. In case we found any of these personal issues, we can arrange educational/therapeutic groups helping them to improve their life skills which reflect the level of their achievements in their academic schools. Thank you,
