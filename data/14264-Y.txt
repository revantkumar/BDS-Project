I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. 

I am a graduate student in computer science, it is well known that this is a highly technology related field, which requires lots of people equipped with lots of special field knowledge. However, the native computer specialists here cannot satisfy the large requirement of specialists as the fast development of computer science. It is shown that Chinese and Indian engineers , as well as engineers from other countries make significant contribution to the development of computer science in US. The CEO of Google now is an Indian engineers, many of the advanced techniques of Google are proposed by foreign engineers, such as MapReduce. It is expected that there will be a booming in the requirement of computer engineers population in the future. It is a pity if the US government doesn't keep these engineers here. It can be expected the computer technology of US will not be as competitive as today, considering large amount of students who received the best computer training in US come back to their motherland or other countries.
