As a teacher, we are incorporating more STEM into our classrooms every day. Why? Why should we when there is such a high rate of American STEM workers out of business because of actions by the US government? It's outrageous that the US government would make it easier and cheaper for US companies to hire foreign born workers instead of American STEM workers.

Important questions that need to be answered from Professor Norm Matloff:

"If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?
If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?"

Further, "[Maybe it is because] if OPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney, [Facebook] and others can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace."

You are destroying the economy and putting more and more people out of work, not to mention that the foreign workers do NOT pay into Social Security, which compounds the effect.
