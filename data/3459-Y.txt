It is unfair for a F-1 nonimmigrant student if cancel this act.As we know, the United States are also combined from lots of immigrant people. And as a F-1 student, they just wanna have more chances to improve and have a better life in the US.It is also a good chance for US to select more better elites from the F-1 OPT student to serve for the US.So please give a chance to F-1 student.
