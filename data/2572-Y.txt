US became the innovation power house it is today because of its embracing gesture towards foreign talents. Entrepreneurs who cannot find the soil to grow their dreams in other countries have been willing to create their companies and venture in the States. They create job opportunities, job opportunities for American citizens. The large number of foreign STEM students are not only a large pool of work force to hire, but also huge possibilities of entrepreneurship inception. I do not want to post any data to help prove my perspective on the larger picture as the statistics can be collected in a biased way or interpreted in deliberation to prove any other point.

And to those citizens who feel like their jobs have been stolen by foreigners: hiring process can be personal, it's only about whether the people who hire you wants to work with you or not, and whether you are qualified for the position.

To those who think foreign STEM students are costing taxpayer's money and leave them in worse financial situation: these students pay full tuition with their own money, and drive up consumption demand when they are living in the States, with their own money. If you think your tax money is not well spent and has to take on debt with student loan, I would love to point your direction to the domestic welfare system and government debt problem. Driving foreign students out of States will not solve even a tiny bit of your current problem. However, if you would like to fall in UK's current situation where the high income people are taxed about 80% or their earning while the people on welfare living really well off the tax money and penalizing work, and university graduates cannot find a job compatible with their education level because of stagnated economics activities, while still having student loans to pay off, please feel free to kick out foreigners and establish your good old welfare and see how it plays out.
