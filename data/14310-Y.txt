I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Many American companies, especially in financial and high-tech industry, have a high demand for international STEM talents. Without the support of OPT, these students do not have legal rights to work in U.S.A, which would be a great loss to both those companies and American economy.

2. OPT attracts a large number of international talents to America. This ensures the U.S. academic sector to remain competitive globally.

3. Many projects in STEM fields take 2 to 3 years or more to finish. With the help of OPT, STEM students are in a better position to contribute to these projects and develop advanced skills that benefit their careers.
