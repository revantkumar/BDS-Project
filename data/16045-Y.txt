Just know today that:
According to reports available through NAFSA (Association of International Educations) it has been estimated that international students contributed $26.8 Billion to US economy. And created or supported 340,000 jobs during 2013-2014 academic year only.
If the OPT extension rule failed, it will prevent international students choosing US for further education, then the loss is not only to schools in US, but also to those US people who are in this industry.
If you run a business but no one comes, you will loss money, you are not able to hire people, then no one contribute to your business, then your business dies.
YOU WILL LOSE NOT ONLY MONEY BUT ALSO JOBS IF YOU MAKE RULES THAT PUSH INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AWAY!!!
Each US citizen, including their babies, will be taken out $69, It would be $128 loss in their paycheck if only consider population of labors.

Most of the students are in graduate school, perusing a Master degree, or even PhD degree. Those people are not here to steal jobs from US citizens, they are actually creating more job demands for US citizens. A economic report states that with one PhD contribute his/her capability, 3-7 jobs are going to created for US citizens, No mention those talent gifted guys could raise a revolution to certain industry, that will bring a tide of jobs to market.
Here is how it works:
Graduate student graduate - they generate new product, new service - demand becomes profit - profit re-flux into innovation - innovation arise new market 
In fact new jobs are kept being created in the whole flow. Any people in US, as long as necessary training, can be part of this. It brings them into something new, something exciting work that help them support their family, have vacation and be part of something big.
Overall, it is a win-win situation to both sides - US economy and individual US citizen.
