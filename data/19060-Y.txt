I do support the OPT extension for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees. This opportunity offers opportunities for international students to apply what they learned from U.S. university and make contributions to the U.S. Most of the industrial and academic projects in STEM area last 2-3 years. It is beneficial to U.S. companies if the new employee is responsible for the project from the beginning to the end. Without this rule, international students are only guaranteed to work in the U.S. for 1 year, and it will be a great loss to U.S. companies after they spend several months training the employee and have to find someone else in only a year. 

Also, diversity is important for the U.S. It is important to have talented people with various backgrounds work in the U.S. to bring different ideas. Companies hire international students since they cannot find qualified Americans for the openings. Competition does help improving capabilities of both native and international students, which ensures that U.S. keeps moving in the direction of global competitiveness and higher productivity. 

In addition, OPT extension will attract more talented students to study in U.S. If international students can only work in U.S. for 1 year after graduations, more and more talented students may consider alternative countries such as U.K., Canada, and Australia for further study, which will not only reduce tuition payment and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, but also hinder contributions to U.S. development from talents. 

Therefore, I strongly support the OPT extension for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees.
