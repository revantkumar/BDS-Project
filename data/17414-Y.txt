If I knew that opt ext was going to stop I would have gone to Canada to do my studies, where I could have got my permanent residents also and paid off my schooling debts, my only need to do opt was to gain experience in my field of study and pay off my tuition which has come to jeopardy due to this new law also frustrating and stressing all of the foreign student community.

I am happy to see steps taken by DHS to save students from this situation and extending the opt would help us more in securing our objectives.
