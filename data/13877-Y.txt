I also would like to comment on the potential "competition" between native American students and international students. 

1. Some people argue that the employers tend to hire OPT students so that they could save the 7.65% tax. But do you know that these employers are actually paying much, much more than the tax? Not to mention that most PhD students ARE actually paying their taxs as normal citizens do because they have been in American for more than 5 years. To support the foreign employees for H1B or whatever other visa, the employers have to pay for more than 40k for each employee. Does any of these employee has an annual salary above 522k? 

2. So why are those employers willing to pay for such a huge amount of money to keep international employees? Actually they are not. Given two similarly qualified job candidates, being one American citizen and one international students, there is no reason that an employer would hire someone with higher cost and worse language/culture fitness. However, the truth is, the number of native Americans in STEM fields is shrinking, and many international students are highly competent in these fields. So the result is, on one hand, not too many American candidates available; on the other hand, many highly qualified and motivated international students are awaiting. 

3. Research/development in STEM fields are often highly collaborative. One reason that STEM fields is thriving in America is that the American culture emphasizes on diversity: diversity in education, personally, and perspectives. It is ironic that under a modern culture labeling itself with diversity, Asian students are often related to stereotypes of being nerdy, and when it comes to job market, instead, people think they don't need those nerdy guys any more.
