Recent times, STEM OPT has been jeopardizing the future of F-1 students. It is a call for us government to make if they want to retain the highly qualified students here. If yes, the present rule should include a plan for those students who has STEM OPT expiring on or before Feb 12. I am an August 2013 graduate and my STEM OPT expires on January 15. I intend to stay here and tried my chances in H1-B lottery but I was not picked in the lottery last two years due to the enormous number of applications. Therefore, the new rule should also propose changes to retain the students who are currently on OPT but would like to benefit from the new OPT STEM rules. For example allow them to apply for remaining 7 month extension during the grace period.
