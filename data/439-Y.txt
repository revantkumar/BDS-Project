I studied as a math graduate student in a US university for five years. I really appreciated the stipend support from US during my study. When I worked as a Teaching Assistant in the graduate school, I never refused any request from students to ask questions outside of the regular office hours: because I felt obligated to pay back as much as I can to help the children of US tax payers who have supported me all the time. Now I have graduated, and just started to work even harder to pay back the US society and people. PLEASE, EXPAND the STEM OPT extension, so that we could use our hands and diligence, to prove to the US people: you were right to have supported me, because I am going to help America to be a greater America, we just need some EXTRA TIME!
