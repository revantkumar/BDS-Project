Dean Reding Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand: 1.OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and 2.OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."
The proposed rule effectively "requires employers and universities to engage in unlawful immigration status discrimination." "The rule requires these organizations to set up mentoring programs for foreign graduates to work under OPT. However, there is no requirement that American graduates receive the same benefit."
If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? OPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.
Of course, the message form this Regulation is that ONLY foreign students get government help while American students are left without any such program (which is unconstitutional on several grounds) and the promised protection of U.S. workers is illusionary.
