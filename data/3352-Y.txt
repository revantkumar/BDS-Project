I strongly support this action for the following reasons.
1. One year OPT period is kind of short both for employer and employee. Many companies would refuse to hire F1 students if the OPT is only available for 1 year. Then, there will be fewer opportunities in the States, and some international students may just give up studying here because there is little chance to have practical training. Thus, the action could avert the rapid loss of international students in the states.
2. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to the United States to study deserves more time to contribute and test themselves. 
3. Competition makes a country stronger. Just like a good company will look for talented, a country with more talented has more power to improve the military, economy, and the public's life. I consider that the 24 months OPT extension will stimulate the growth of the states but not affect people's career for the long run.
