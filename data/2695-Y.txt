Yingpei Wang I definitely support OPT STEM extension.

First of all, everyone, specially well educated ones, should have rights to work in the right place for them and contribute to the world with their knowledge. STEM extension is a good way and provider enough time for talented international students working in their skilled area.

US is an immigration country from very beginning and this fact do help US becoming the strongest country in the world since last century. Talented and skilled people are always the best foundation for a country's developing. Last century, US accepted scientist from everywhere in the world. Now US has best research people and environment in almost every field. Today, international students are working in high technology companies and changing the world in a new way. There is definitely no reason to take the opportunity from them.

We should keep talents in US!
