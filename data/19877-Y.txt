Glad to see this new rule with longer STEM extension for F1 students.

The U.S. is a country that has the best education in the world and attracts the best students from around the world. A lot of students on F1 visa had great achievement in school and have great potential to contribute more to the industries and the country when they become professionals. As much as they want to work hard and make the society better, these talents are lost and have to go back to their home countries because of work authorization issues in the U.S.. 

We don't want that do happen. The U.S. is a dream land that welcomes the smartest and most talented people from around the world. If this is the best place to nurture the best scientists, researchers and professionals to make breakthroughs and make the world better, then it should provide all the opportunities for them to do so.

With the increasing applications for H1 visa, the lottery system forces a lot of great talents to leave the country. This rule will help them and increase their chance to stay in the U.S. and continue their great work.
