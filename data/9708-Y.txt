I agree to expand OPT for several reasons.
1. With a longer OPT US can attract more students, and keep highly competitive globally. If OPT time is reduced, there will be much fewer international students. This is extremely bad for American education.
2. Companies prefer to hire international students, even though they need to pay more for their visa. This means international students are pretty excellent, and promote the American science and technology.
3. Some students are currently in OPT extension. If the OPT policy is cancelled, it is unfair to them. US is the leader of the world, and should be responsible to them.
