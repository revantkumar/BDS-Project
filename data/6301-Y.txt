I support this rule.

However, I think currently the OPT and H1b lottery system should be improved. 
Students using this OPT should be better monitored. Too many students are abusing it and work as cheap work forces. This should be prohibited.

H1b system is also abused. There are applicants submitting multiple applications per person to increase the chances to get the H1b.

Anyway, I support it and hope it could be better.
