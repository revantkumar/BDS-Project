The proposed rule to expand the OPT program must not be implemented because It would harm our nation. The proposed program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Incentives should go to American workers, not foreign workers. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not actively work against us.
