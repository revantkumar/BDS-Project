I am so convinced that the expansion of Training Oppotinites for students with STEM degrees will benifit both these talents and the USA. Above all, most of the nonimmigrant students studying STEM are the best ones from their native countries. They went through tough competitions against their peers to seize the opportunity to study oversea. Thus, there is no doubt that their capability of handling high-grade tasks with superior difficulty is remarkable. This will surely make huge profits for American economy and the whole society. These talents, if can stay in the U.S.A. for a longer time, will influence deeply on many aspects of th country. We have little reason to reject the opportunity for the technological and economic booming. Also, some people may argue that more students in America seeking for jobs will lead to fiercer competition, which may increase the rate of unemployment. But I would say the competition is a good thing for it will promote people in US, no matter domestic people or nonimigrant students, to strive for their jobs. I believe this will make the American society to thrive and be more productive. Fianlly, America is a country with diverse culture and human race. It should be more tolerant of different people as long as it will not do harm to the national security. Those nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees no only cannot bring any harm, but they will create many benefits as I just mentioned before. All things considered, I cannot think of any reason for not approving or passing this proposal.
