I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:

1. The government should let students contribute what they learned from US university or colleges to US societies. As the economic keeps improving, there will be more demanding of workforce with high level education. International students will appreciate and value all opportunities they get in the US job market and work really hard and efficiently.

2. Diversity is very important for US culture. I believe a nation or a country with freedom and diversities are a nation will flourish and developing more. International students come to US not only to receive high quality of education, but also to make difference in communities. Good working environment for international students will definitely attract more students from the world.

3. Competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing to have in US. Competition make the society better. The rule of nature is competition. The strongest survive.
