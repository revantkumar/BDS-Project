I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 

1. Nowadays many Chinese top students come to U.S. to study. They are very talented in the STEM majors and also most of them want to work in U.S. If they can stay in U.S. ,they will contribute their hard work and intelligence to U.S., which is very helpful to the social industry. But if there is not much possibility for them to stay in U.S. because of the short OPT, many top students may not choose U.S. as the favored destination to study abroad. Because as far as I know, the possibility to stay and work is becoming more and more important in students' decision making. 

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition can help U.S. society select more qualified talents, which can also raise the average quality bacause everyone will work harder in order not to be washed out. The extension of OPT can spur everyone on to greater efforts. We have reason to believe that this proposal can certainly help to promote the economic prosperity of U.S.!
