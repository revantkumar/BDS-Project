I highly support the extension of OPT. It will bring the diversity as well as prosperity to the current US society and economy. As the industry grows, more and more jobs will be opened. It will provide more chances to the US residents as well. Besides, the tolerance of multi-culture brings the prosperity to the current US society. So, I am strongly support the extension of OPT for STEM students
