Anonymous Anonymous The best way to retain new and fresh talent from the graduate students is through providing Employment Authorization to them.
The contribution of OPT graduates in terms of number of candidates might be low but they are fresh and innovative.
Extended duration of OPT extension attracts more international students which eventually grows the job opportunities and business/economy in US. So, How about proposing the rule making team to implement this rule.
I see a debate kind of discussion who is opposing this rule. How come skilled graduates create unemployment to the citizens if they are capable of innovation!
