I strongly support the OPT STEM extension regulation. Today, many individuals contributing to the STEM fields are immigrants, and research indicates that skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow US economy. If OPT STEM extension regulation cannot pass, tens of thousands of foreign students working for US companies will be forced to leave, which will be a disaster both for employers and employees. I am currently working for a high tech company in silicon valley. One out of five employees in my group must leave without the approval of the regulation by the end of next February, and the project we are working on cannot meet the schedule and millions of dollars loss may occur.

Foreign STEM students working in the US do not steal jobs. The E-verify program will ensure the integrity of the STEM OPT extension. On the contrary, the new regulation helps to create more jobs for Americans. Foreign students regularly contributes a significant amount of money into the US economy. When I went to dealer's to buy a car, the dealer told me so many international students like me came to his since we needed cars for transportation. International students helped his business, and he said he was considering expanding his business. 

As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.
