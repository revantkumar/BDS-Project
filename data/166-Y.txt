As a potential student who will study in America next year, I strongly supprt the 24 month extension on the OPT. because only with the benefits and chances given to the us,we would want to studying abroad and have the motivation to make contributions to the USA. All these things will give America more fundings and more convenience. and with competetions to the jobs, the country will have an easy access to more outstanding experts instead of those people who are worrying about losing their jobs and oppose to this extension rather than improving their own abilities!!!
