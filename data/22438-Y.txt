I strongly support the new STEM policy. Please don't say the US has enough stem workers. It's us that make the Silicon Valley the most important technical district all over the world. If the US don't need us, why there are so many technical companies still willing to hire us even they know that hiring US residents is more easier? And we also pay more tax which almost takes our half of salaries. But we still want to make contributions to technology and daily life.
