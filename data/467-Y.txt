I really support this new regulation. The United States should always try to attract those high educated young people regardless of their nationalities. The United States is such a country that built by thousands of immigrants. The United States cannot be the leader of the world in almost all aspects without the contributions from high educated immigrants. In my opinion, the United States have to keep accepting and giving more chances to the people with STEM degrees to maintain the leadership of the world.
