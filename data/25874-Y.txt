The new 24 month STEM OPT rule is beneficial to the United States, thus I strongly support this new rule. If the STEM OPT extension is unavailable, there will be two primary issues:

First, the United States will lose the chance to retain excellent STEM workers. Only 1 year OPT will largely reduce the chance that some talent STEM workers successfully get the H1B working visa. Only 1 year OPT gives some excellent new graduate only one chance to participate in the H1B lottery, and if they fail, they have to go back to their home country. I believe its a big loss to the high-tech industry in the United States. 

Second, college and universities will suffer from great financial loss. If the STEM OPT extension is cancelled, studying in the Unites States will be no longer attractive to foreign students. When choosing a country for foreign study, many students value the experience gained through the OPT program in the United States. However, only 1 year practical training period for a STEM student is too short. Generally, international students pay much more tuition than domestic students, and some foreign student even got large amount of education loans to pay for their study in the Unities States. If the OPT extension is not available, I believe there will be less and less foreign students come to study in the Unites States, and colleges and universities will lose a big part of tuition from international students.

In conclusion, the new 24 month STEM OPT rule will definitely help boost the economy in the United States. And it also helps the country to stay more open to the world, and retain more diversity in its culture. This new rule should definitely be adopted.
