OPT extension to 24 month is necessary. First, time extension means more probability for anyone enrolled in STEM programs to find jobs or continue research in US, which of course will strengthen US research leadership.
Second, longer OPT serves as a relief of pressure for students since they need not worry day and night for their next jobs during their final one or maybe two years of the PhD program, thus focusing on their current research.
Third, generally it's quite difficult for international students to figure out what to do once they graduate, the extension will give them more opportunities to find their own career.
