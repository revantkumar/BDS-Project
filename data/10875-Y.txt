I strongly SUPPORT this STEM Extension proposal.
In my university, over 80% of graduate students in STEM majors are international students with F-1 Nonimmigrant visa, which means most of students in STEM job market are keeping F-1 Visa, and using OPT. I believe this is a universal phenomenon in whole US. So if they can not get the STEM extension, they can only work in US for at most 1 year. However, for most companies, the projects and new researches always last 2-3 years. Which means, the employees who's in OPT status have to leave their research before it is done. This will decrease the speed of company and technology development. However, nowadays, technology is the most important thing for each country. We say United State is one of the most powerful nation in the world because of US's advanced science and technology. We chose to achieve our graduate degree in US because of US's advanced science and technology. Looking back on the history of US, a lot of huge contributions in STEM area were made by international students. They came to US and received the education here, and because of STEM Extension program, they had chance to make contribution and paid back to US. Without STEM extension program, lots of excellent international student will have to leave US in short time after their graduation. They used to be the top students in their university. They failed to make contribution to US not because of the don't want to, but because government doesn't provide a chance to let them do so. It is really regretful to see something like that happen. And it is really bad for the development of US.
So, I think the STEM extension is very important for the future of US, and I strongly support it.
