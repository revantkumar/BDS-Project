I support extending the OPT period for those with F-1 student visas. This is important to our economy as it is difficult to find qualified individuals to fill the jobs that today's global economy requires. By extending the amount of time those with F-1 OPT visas can stay and work in the US, it will increase the chances that they can get a H1B visa via the lottery process and prevent top talent from being educated in the US and then sent back to their countries. This causes the US to lose a great source of very talented individuals. Please push through the extension of the OPT time period for those with F-1 student visas.
