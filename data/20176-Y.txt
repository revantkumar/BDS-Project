Owing to the fact that international students contribute largely to the U.S economy through higher tuition and other expenses, there is the need to try to keep attracting them to the United States with incentives that draw them here in the first place. Comparatively, it more expensive to study in the U.S than other countries competing for international students. But international students prefer the U.S due to the practical emphasis on education through after study work and the "realistic fantasy" that is the American dream. But in most fields especially the STEM fields- which constitutes a majority of majors which international students come to the U.S for- one year is not enough to have real life experience of what is learned in 4 years undergraduate, 2 or more years of masters or 3 or more years of PhD. The contributions of international students (and graduates) to the school system, economy and technological advancement of the United States is undeniable and for this reason, sustenance of and/or extension of the STEM OPT is indispensable to keep us (international students) enrolling.
