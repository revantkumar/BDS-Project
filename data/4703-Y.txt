I strongly support this rule for follow reasons:
1.It is American spirit to give everyone equal chance.And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.

2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area.

3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
