Vivian Han As STEM students graduating from Universities in US, we really want to apply what we learn and contribute to industrial with the proper rights. With this new proposal of OPT extension for 24 months, we will have this right! 

Passing of this legislation will not only benefit STEM students, but also benefit the US Industrial/high-tech companies! Especially for high-tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and so many others! There are so many new graduate students like me, or those with 1 year working experience already. We got cutting-edge skills, creative thinking and great passion!
You can imagine how much contributions will be made to the development of the US modern technology and economy. 

Passing this legislation is really important! So please consider approving it!
