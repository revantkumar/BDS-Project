XIN GU I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Students who learned knowledge and skills in US are more familiar with American society, American values, and American dream. If they could have more chances to work in US, they would more easily make contribution to US. They would more spread American values and dream to others all over the world. In this way, allowing those international students working in US easily would benefit US a lot!

2. American is pround of its multiculture and expanding training opportunities would help American to acheive this goals. By expanding and improving these opportunies, more and more international students would want to come to US for further studies. This can help US boost its economy and to help maintain its multi cultures. Otherwise, the difficult of find good training opportunities would scare many potential international students.
