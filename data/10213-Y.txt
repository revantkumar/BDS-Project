I strongly support this proposal. And in my opinion, it will bring great benefits to both the STEM students and United States.

These STEM students are all well-trained students with in-depth expertise in the STEM fields. If they can stay to work in United States, they must form great work force which could boost the economy of United States a lot.

And I don't want to competition does exist. But the reason why STEM students are important is because the companies could not find the right ones in United States. And this missing work force could slow down the economy of United States and endanger other related areas which are mainly occupied by natives. So the competition won't be a big issue here. But the whole economy matters more.
