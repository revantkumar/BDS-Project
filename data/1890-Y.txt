We all see the great success in U.S. economy during the recent years, with the contribution from F1 STEM students. Fundamentally, there's no conflict between F1 nonimmimgrant STEM students and U.S. citizens during job seeking. The fact is there are many job openings in STEM but lack of enough applicants. Every year, STEM companies bring great amount of new job opportunities and improve life quality all over America. Without OPT students, there will be no ipad/iphone, no Tesla motor.
