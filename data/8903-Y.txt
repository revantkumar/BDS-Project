In the history of America, if there is something that defines and distinguishes America more than anything, it's that America is the land of opportunity. In today's world every major global economy depends on technological innovation to keep it ahead of other countries and create economic growth. I believe that extending the STEM Extension to 36 months instead of 24 months for students who are currently on the 17 month STEM Extension and for all the students to come in the future is a step in the right direction to keep America in the lead in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math while also staying true to the promise of this great land. Long live America.
