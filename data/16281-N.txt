I am adamantly opposed to this unlawful expansion of the H-1B program which is already rife with fraud. Employers are lobbying for this change in order to hire foreign workers at lower salaries than equally qualified American citizen or legal resident STEM candidates. The disgraceful conduct of Disney in having its current workers train their foreign replacements is just one example of how this program will be abused by greedy corporations seeking to save a few bucks.

You are complicit in the destruction of the American middle class. When did this nation's motto change to OF THE CORPORATION, BY THE CORPORATION AND FOR THE CORPORATION.
