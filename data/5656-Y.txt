I strongly support the OPT extension rule not only for the benefit of international graduate students but also for the continued growth of USA in terms of its economy and nation's integrity.
The implementation of this rule will create a space to the unfortunate candidates whose H1 is not picked in the lottery. 
The contribution of OPT students in the IT and medical industry is phenomenal.
Re-considering 24 months of OPT extension from 17 months is an indication that the regulatory bodies identified the importance of highly qualifies STEM graduates. Consideration to 36 months of OPT extension is much appreciated.

I urge the regulatory bodies/government who are involved in this rule making process to understand the importance of graduate international students in integrating the US economy.
