I strongly support this rules!

I spent my 5 years PhD and 2 years Master in United States. I spent some many money in this country. I paid lots of tax!!! But I can't get 24 month OPT extension?

When I decides to come to United States, it because United States can offer OPT! If United States cancel OPT extension, then United States lies to me!!!
