When I was choosing graduate program, I had England, Australia and Hongkong to choose, the 29 months OPT is a good score-adder for me at that time. If OPT extension was gone, I might not choose this program. In the future as well, other foreign students may turn to other countries for further studying.

I am an IE student in my OPT(first year), if the policy change, my plan of life and work will totally changed, it is not what I expected before I came to the U.S.

One year OPT period is too short for students to be hired, not even gain work experience. Most STEM job need a learning period like 3-4 month for new employee to fit in. Due to the OPT limit, many company refuse to offer job opportunities to STEM students right now. I highly doubt if OPT just one year will any of STEM students get hired.
