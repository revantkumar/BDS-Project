I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Currently employers who have invested lots of time and money on the STEM OPT employees are not ready to withdraw/lose so many employees in their company all of a sudden. This is going to be a major lose to many large corporations, especially here in California. It is INSANE to fail this proposal so that we will lose quite a lots of protential RESOURCES in the firm and have the urgent need to fill those positions with unnessary alternatives. 

2. The government should encourage the students who have learned knowledge from the best U.S. universities to stay in the countries, to CONTRIBUTE to our GDP. 

3. We definitely want to encourage the DIVERSITY of our working place as well as on campus. Void this proposal will hurt it really badly. We started as a country building with immigrants and we should appreciate this, and continue to enbrace this diversity. 

4. I agree that this will increase the human capital competition in the job market, but it is NEVER a bad thing to have more COMPETITION. These STEM OPT employees may increase the competitiveness of the job market in a COMPLEMENTARY way: they can perfectly fill in the positions which our natives are not good at, or do not care to do. We employers are not studid. None of our employers is stupid enough to hire internationals, and give up the natives, if their skillsets do not match. We need this good competition to stay in the market to increase our competitive advantage in the global environment. Look at how Singapore is doing to enhance this, and I feel ashame for those who say no to the proposal. 

The above is my personal opnion and not representing any party. I sincerely hope this proposal can be passed.
