I think this proposal can bring great benefits to both the US and these foreign non-immigrant students.
First, I believe the US is such a democratic country that always gives equal chances to everyone.
Second, the students who are able to get an offer under competition deserves more time to both practice their skills and make contribution to their companies in the US.
Finally, it is good for both the economy and the education of the US because more talented students will work for american companies for a longer time and the longer OPT will attract more talented students from all around the world which means to some extent, someday, most of the genius of the world will gather together in one place ----- The United States of America.
