I strongly support the OPT extension for the following reasons:

1) Diversity is one of the most important advantages in US. By attracting the talented all over the world, US will have a strong basis for the development of technology. Kicking these talented people is not helpful at all. International students come to US to help the development of technology in US. They are friendly and making contribution, rather than hostile.

2) Competition will help US become a better country. Even if it becomes sort of competitive to find a job in US, it only happens in certain areas. What's more, the competition improve the average ability of Americans, which will be very important in the future.
