I strongly support the OPT extension for STEM program. As an international student, I have been studying in the U.S. for 5 years, and even with the extension program, I am still hard to find a job, because every where is asking for a green card or U.S. citizenship. American students already has priorities in finding a job. We didn't steal the job. We do the job because we are able to do and we do make contribution to the U.S economy.
