I totally support this motion. For those who think this motion would give more jobs to aliens but not US citizen, I think they are shallow, bias and arrogant. The statistics show that more than 85% of the students of EE and CS major are from other countries. If STEM extension is cancelled, all the well-educated talents would be effected and this chain reaction would break down all the way from the academic performance, university region local economy, high-tech industry, finally, to the backbone of our nation's innovation ability and competitiveness! If 85% of the STEM students lose their OPT, That means that our STEM related industry would lose 85% of good employees! 
STEM students never take jobs from US citizen because 99% American citizens are even not STEM majors!
STEM student never lower the basic wage standard! Administration needs to regulate illegal and unqualified immigrants, not talented legal STEM students who bring up economy growth, innovation ,vitality and job offer to US!
