I totally agree on this extension. The opt program is very helpful for U.S. It is not just a opportunity for foreign students to stay in U.S, but for American economy, finance and even technology improvements. Because of this chance, more students choose to working a while before they go back to their homeland. So they take some basic but boring jobs with very little money. And after 2 years, Most of them would go back to their own countries. This would help U.S to improve the market without paying too much. This also helps to choose the best talent in the world, and let them to become an American. 

Some people said this would makes them harder to get a job as an American. Which is really ridiculous! This is why our people become so lazy and hard to learn. They expect to earn without learning! Life is too easy for some people. But the opt would helps. This program would let those lazy people to realize how incompetent they are. They need to learn and work harder. This provides a good environment for the education, human resources! Opt would become an challenge and threaten to people, which remind them of the importance of hard working!!

Besides, this is a cruel truth that if you couldn't find a job after graduation,don't blame on other competitors (such as international students), the society or even government policy! If you good enough you will get a chance to show yourself! Stop blaming on others, and get to learn more! Cancelling opt extension doesn't mean you will find a job!
