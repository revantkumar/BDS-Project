I strongly support this expansion. For those who said it will take away opportunities from US citizens, you are totally have no clue what happened when a international student wants to find a job in US. For all international students, they definitely need H1B sponsorship. As long as they need the sponsorship, the probability to find a job has decrease at least a half, they might not even be able to get a interview when the companies know they are in OPT, not even close to a interview. Not many companies want to sponsor H1B as they don't want to risk the time and money cause H1B petition is a lottery, it could fail. For those international students who can find a job in US, they are really smart people and they make a great contribution to the country, I have no idea why these smart should not deserve a job cause the immigration status. All the students in OPT are in legal status, they can only work related to their major/degree, they have to pay taxes/everything, they get less tax return than US Citizens. In another words, only students are really smart/skilled can find a job during OPT, the others can't find a job will go back to their home country after the 90 day unemployment period, so I don't see there is any possibility there international students can take away US citizens' money and this expansion definitely will increase the number of highly skilled and smart high tech workers, which will make a great contribution to the country. So I don't see there is any reason to reject this expansion.
