As an non-extension major international student who studies in the United States, I think the OPT extension brings long term benefit for both international students and US citizens.I strongly agree to the extension. 

First, extending the STEM OPT would benefit the economy growth of the US because it will attract more international students to study in the U.S which would create a huge amount of consumptions. Moreover, the international students have been a very important group of American education system as they are contributing diversity, academic achievemnt to the country from technology development perspective.

Second, these STEM advanced degree holders helped and will continue helping the economy's bloom of U.S. High-tech industries relies on engineers and scientists. And the profit of high-tech technology is huge and has been the contributing the economy for decades. 

All in all, I think the declination of STEM OPT extension program would greatly discourage international students to apply American universities. This is a huge disaster not only to international students but also to American higher education.
