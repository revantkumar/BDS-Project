George Smith I strongly support this OPT extension policy. Immigrants played a very important role in Americas history. The U.S. should not shut the door to foreigners. Some people complain that foreign opt students are cheap labor. However, this is not true. Their salary is at the same level as U.S. citizens and they pay the same tax. The reason why companies hire foreign workers is just because there are not enough qualified U.S. workers. So I totally agree to give foreign students a chance to work for the country.
