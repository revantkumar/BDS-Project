I believe that the level of effort I have put up to do graduation and to learn the stuff in college and after graduation is making me a better person everyday. I would love to work in U.S.A as it gives me an edge over other folks around the world. This extension would give students like me another hope and ample experience to hone their skills in the technologies we graduated. Also, it makes the life of every individual easy as I am contributing towards U.S.A economy everyday.
