I am opposed to the proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program. Such rules are a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates who already have a difficult time finding suitable employment. The proposed program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S. This would essentially expand the number of workers available for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually encourages employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it. This action must not be allowed to be put in place.
