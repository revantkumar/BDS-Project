I support this regulations for the benefit of American

1A long term extension will attract more foreign students to consider using their initial OPT chance. Otherwise, they will choose to go back to their home country after graduation. By that way, the American industry will suffer the shortage of higher educated employees. 
2Another problem is if more and more students go back to their country after graduation, more people in the future will consider it is valuable to study in America. Because a way to evaluate an education good or bad is to see whether the student can find a job. So it more international students fail to stay here, not only industry, but also the education will suffer recession. Please remember, no students, no money! 
3As more and more students came and studied in America since 2008 recession, and increasing corresponding infrastructures were built in the past years and will be built in the future. If those students leave because of policy problem, who will come to consume this investment? For example, many new apartments were built, more supermarkets were open, but after these students leave, who will rent these additional apartments, who will go shopping in these extra supermarkets? Please not mention the future students, just I said, no more student will come if they find their former people all go back only with a degree but no any industry or useful experience. We all know that in STEM major, working experiences are more important than degree. It is the same all over world. No one will waste time at a place without job.
