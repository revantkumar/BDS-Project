24-month STEM OPT extension is definitely win-win to the United States and foreign students. Comparing to other countries who provide good higher education like UK, Australia,Canada, United States attracts foreign students to come not only because of advanced knowledge and skills those colleges offer but more importantly with OPT and Extension, students can gain more practical experience on their study. A few years of work experience in US is highly valued in China and i think it is the same for many other countries. That is making and will make United States the NO.1 country for many foreign students to come and study instead of UK or Canada. Therefore, i strongly support OPT extension.
