I fully support the extension for international STEM degrees students. Their working opportunities in the US are not only their own futures and lives, but also are their abilities and energies which can help the US. Most of these students are talented and have received the best educations in the US. They should have the opportunities to realize their own lives, as well as contribute to the developments of the US.
