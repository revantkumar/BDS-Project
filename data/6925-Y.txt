I definitely support this proposal, reason follows:

The non-profit educational organization I worked in Long Island, NY, we have so many international students joined, they are writing course materials in computer science and engineering, joining live events and teaching kids how to code. They made a lot of contributions in both Nassau and Suffolk county, kids love them too. 

Technology is playing more and more important role in the next several decades, we want to educate kids about it and kids are eager to learn, however, it will be a giant loss for our organization if those international students don't have the opportunity to work with us, since we can't find enough volunteers and mentors for kids. 

Also, if we force those international students go back to China, India, etc, they will not only make contribution to their current IT industry, but also educate next generation about technology (like what we did in Long Island), and U.S for sure doesn't want to lose the competition in the future.

Every year thousands and thousands international students graduated from U.S universities, they should stay in the country and keep making contributions to the U.S. 

Thus, I strongly support this proposal, it no doubt will bring U.S tremendous benefits.
