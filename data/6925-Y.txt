Dawn Weller This is absurd! With all the stipulations already limiting even citizens and their jobs (certain quotas must be met even if someone else is more qualified) it make absolutely no sense to give away more jobs (especially as a requirement by law with a quota) to foreign students or otherwise. There are plenty of homeless already who have been added to the statistics because of lost jobs as well as graduates who still haven't found work; we need to allow MORE jobs for our college grads and men and women who live in this great country since they cannot all head overseas to get jobs as the U.S. seems to be so generously doing for the foreigners. It is so sad to see our government and President so sadly out of touch with real people and real living and choosing to be caught up in all the politics and bureaucracy which leads to decisions made for reasons other than the best for its people. Our government and its decisions were created BY the people and FOR the people. That means its own citizens not the citizens of other countries should be working and thriving in this country.
