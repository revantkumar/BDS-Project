This STEM OPT plan should be STRONGLY SUPPORTED and APPROVED!
As an international student studying in the US, I believe this international student body not only add diversity and talent to the educational environment, but also provide big economic benefits that cannot be neglected. Tuition, fees, living expense, and many other costs that we've contributed to the local economy. What we expect in return is nothing more than fair and equal opportunities to be trained in the STEM field after graduation. This right for international STEM students is undisputed!!
