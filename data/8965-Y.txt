I strongly support this!
US in the very beginning, as an independent nation, was built on the hard work of immigrants. It is in the spirit of this country to embrace talented minds and hardworking hands from all over the globe. This is exactly what makes US the most powerful and equal-opportunity country in the world.
In today's world, technological developments and breakthroughs are the most effective sources of a country's competences. Hence STEM degrees are among the most needed if not the most valuable ones. By improving the training opportunities for students with STEM degree, we can keep these young clever minds to work in US, and for US. Some of them will settle in the US, and start a family with, most likely, a much higher education standards than average households in US now.
This is beneficial for both the US, as well as the talented young foreigners who love the US!
