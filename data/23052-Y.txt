As a F1 student at Harvard University, I really need F1 OPT extension to 24 months. The major reason is I want to keep doing my research study after graduation to higher level, which needs more time. When I apply for US graduate school, I was told there will be a two year OPT work opportunity after graduation, but if this is revoked, I feel less desirable to take PHD program. Thank you!
