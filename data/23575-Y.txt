I strongly support this rule and here is why:
According to the past experience in my research group in my company, well trained and skilled F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degree have been made huge contributions especially to IT technology and semiconductor industry. Some people blame F-1 students for lower wages, others "accuse" F-1 students of stealing jobs away, but it doesn't make any sense at all.
From the company's point of view, we are looking for talented and diligent engineers no matter who you are or where you are originally from. Talented and skilled engineers/scientists are highly demanded, if all these skilled F1 students are kicked out, where can we find qualified engineers ? 
Remember, we are looking for "qualified" engineers, being an american citizen doesn't automatically make you a "qualified" engineer.
These F1 students are not stealing American's jobs, they are helping America to build strong economy which will lead to a better life and society.
We should give them opportunities and keep these skilled workforce who could potentially change the world.
