This is the best immigration movement that I am witnessing. There might be many STEM workers, but this does not mean a company can employ anyone with STEM degree. In this country to maintain state of art infrastructure and technology, they need the brightest student to work help make the nation better. Bright students come from variety of backgrounds and help this nation. This is a great movement forward and should be totally passed as it will help nation be better and this country is land of immigrants. All the big innovations are done by immigrants so why not give bright students a chance.
