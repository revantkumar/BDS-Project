I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It has been proved that in the past foreign students have made great contribution to this country, extending the STEM OPT will no doubt benefit the U.S. economy.

2. Competition between the citizens and the foreign students do exists, but it is the competition that makes both the citizens and the foreign students more competitive, which will greatly benefit the U.S. economy.

3. Some industries may be highly demanding in terms of man power, hiring citizens only is not enough, that's when foreign students are needed to contribute to this country.
