Many people ignore the benefit that this act brings to America:
1.The OPT attracts more international students to come to American universities paying with a significant amount of international tuition that can in turn support more US residents for better education.
2.The OPT increases the employment opportunity for local residents overall because more people are attracted to launch startups as attempts after their college graduation.
3.The OPT will be beneficial to the STEM industry in US from a long-term perspective. If these talented workers all flood into China and India, the US IT and other industry will have a harder time competing in the world market.
