The OPT extension is fair and good; and my reasons are as follows:

The rule does not give international students privileges that are otherwise not enjoyed by American citizens. It only creates more equal opportunities. A lot of angry comments fixate on the idea that rightful American jobs are stolen by foreigners. I empathize but disagree because it implies that international students get the jobs unfairly. Quite the contrary, they are employed because they work harder and are more skilled than the ones who are not. In many cases, even if they are more qualified, positions are not offered because of their immigration statuses. I understand it is unpleasant to lose job to a foreigner. But what about getting a job not because of being better but because of being American? The citizenship should not entail any superiority. And the prevalent double standard is absurd. If we follow the idea of "they should work hard and earn it like Americans do" as many opponents put it, the rule should be welcomed, only to be fair. 

We all know competition is good. The whole concept of free market is based on competition, not monopoly. The foundation of America is based on democracy, not dictatorship. Insecurity leads to failure, not success. But why are people so insecure when it comes to a fair competition? The only outcome of competing with international students is to become better and more qualified. Isn't that a good thing? This insecurity is also unfounded. STEM majors are relatively unpopular among American students. Only a small fraction of the graduates would actually face the (fair) competition. The doom of jobs taken over by foreign STEM students is exaggerated. 

America is one of the most accepting and diverse countries. Reading the comments makes me sad. I hope there will be more conversations in the future instead of hostile complaints.
