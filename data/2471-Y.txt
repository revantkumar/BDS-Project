I think it is reasonable to expand the Cap-Gap Relief for F-1 Students. Usually the students use the one-year OPT to find an intern and if their employers are satisfied with their work and decide to sponsor them H1b visas, these non-immigrant students need a valid identification to stay in the U.S. during the period of the transition from F-1 to H1B. 

I propose either to expand the OPT time a few months to October, when the result of H1b application comes out, or to elongate Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 students.
