There are pros and cons, but in my opinion, i tend to agree with the new rule with 24 month extension for STEM, not only am i an international student, but the success of the nation (i.e. US) seems to have a lot to do with the immigrants. the point for work place is that it is important to hire/use able/diligent workers (not lazy), we might see this as a natural selection - the survival of fittest. Even if the rule is revoked, would companies stop hiring foreign workers? this is still a question though, one thing that might be clear is that universities would have less international students (which is bad for US economy), and also companies might still hire foreign workers, again the main concern for those who object the new rule may still remain....

the new rule does give those who are smart and intelligent students a good chance (i would not say equal chance, as US local students do have lot more advantages over international students, they may pay less tuition, they dont need to consider OPT and visa, etc...

Again in my opinion, the pros of the new rule seem to overweight its cons...
