I strongly support this new rule. It ensures OPT STEM students can get the right format of training from Industry. People who are against this don't give much read to the new rule article. Example of a rumor they give that Disney will train a portion of oversea employees, has nothing to do with after-graduation program of STEM students. Let alone Disney is barely a tech company, which hires STEM students. Also people, haven't you heard of Tokyo Disney, and Shanghai Disney???
