Xuan Zhang It's my honor to to express my opinion about 24 Months STEM OPT extension.

I support this great proposal, as it benefits both the international students and U.S. economy. 

STEM job market is far away form saturation, thus taking F1 students into the job market doesn't mean limit the opportunity to native students. Most F1 students are those with master or Ph.D degree and they can fill the workforce shortage at highly-educated level. Not most American students would like to enter a graduate program thus the F1 workforce is necessary to U.S. economy.

More job opportunities to international students means it will attract more students to study oversea and it also contributes to the economy of U.S. university. F1 students contribute a lot of tuition to university. Without the opt extension means most students will hesitate about studying oversea as they may lose job hunting advantages compared to the students in their homeland.

The last but not the least, U.S. economy is during recovery and re-boom stage. The companies, industries need high-quality labor to speed up the recovery and it definitely not a good idea to remove the job opportunity for F1 students which will lead to shortage of workforce in many important positions.

I have spent about 5 years in U.S. and I saw many students work hard in their position in companies. They are good workers and we all feel thankful to this country and hope it become better. It would be the dream of all F1 students that U.S. economy recovery under the effort of us and all other native citizens. Different nationality, the same dream.
