I absolutely support the extension rule and it will not cause any bad effects on US citizens. A lot of people argue that this extension rule will harm American workers, however it is not the case. As we all know, almost all of the US companies will ask applicants one question that "Will you now or in the future require sponsorship to be authorized to work in the United States?" Actually, no US companies will hire international students if native workers are qualified for those positions. In another word, native workers always have priorities to be hired compared to international students. Therefore, it is obvious that the existence of the extension rule and competent international candidates will not harm any native candidates if they themselves are really qualified and talented. 

Meanwhile, if the extension rule is not passed, a lot of US companies who need highly qualified and intelligent international students will encounter difficulties in their daily operations, which is not good for the overall development of the United States.

The OPT extension rule is essential to support the development of the economy, especially high-tech and IT industry in the United States as most of graduate students who receive advanced education in the areas such as computer science and financial engineering are international students who will need the OPT extension.
