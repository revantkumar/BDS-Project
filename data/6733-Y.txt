I think the improvement and expansion of Training Opportunities is not only necessary but also a must. It is one of the significant advantage for international students to choose U.S. for graduate study instead of other countries. Also, it helps relieve the needs for high-end engineers in a lot of fields in the U.S. Trust me, it is really hard for startups to hire people nowadays, and F1 students under OPT is smart and diligent in a lot of ways.
