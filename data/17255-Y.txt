I extremely support the rule to improving and expanding OPT STEM and CapGap Relief for the F1 Students. The implement of this rule can attract more international talents to US and contribute to the US development. Without the rule, those talented students educated in US for their undergraduate and graduate degrees very likely have to go back and construct their own country, which is a big loss to US.
