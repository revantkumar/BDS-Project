I strongly recommend federal government pass this regulation, not from an international student's perspective, but also considering the improvement of the society.

As far as I know, international students is the majority backup for work in engineering field. With an extension on OPT, foreign engineers could work longer and form stronger bonds with their employees, which saves money and time for company. This is the first thing that benefits US companies from this regulation.

Another point is, with extended OPT, more oversea students would be attracted to study here, promoting the education in the sense that universities are more diverse which may cause more communication with other culture. 

Other positive outcomes include stimulating the economy, creating more jobs and etc can be foreseen from this regulation.
