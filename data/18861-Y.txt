Opt are only given to the people who had high level education in USA, which are people who are really smart, hard working and consent to the value of America. The worst case is to drive these well educated and smart people back to their own country and let competitors of US companies to hire them. There will be huge impact on the economy if US companies lose in the competition. The best way to keep the advantage in high tech area is to hire the right people regardless of their nation, leaving no smart people in other country. In this way, US will always be the best country in the world. So I strongly support the OPT extension.
