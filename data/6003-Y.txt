The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow them to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. The U.S. Must Attract and Retain Global Talent to Stay Competitive.
