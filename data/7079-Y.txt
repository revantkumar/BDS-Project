I highly SUPPORT this regulation.

It is weird to drive off the trained students even we need them. It is even more weird to think like OPT are taking over jobs for salary reasons. Offshoring companies won't recruit OPT students who are working in America. Instead, they work hard and study hard to improve our economies. 

Definitely, we should forbid offshore companies but for F1-OPT, US need them.
