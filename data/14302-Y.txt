Disney Land is a good example. Disney Land brought in all new foreign computer tech workers and used them to replace their current US tech workers at a much lower wadge. And they even had the gaul to have their current computer tech workers train the new foreign workers. Allowing this to happen displaced thousands of US computer tech employee into the unemployment lines and onto the welfare rolls. This policy already is a loose, loose situation for this country and by expanding it from one year to three years just compounds the problem. These foreign students need to take their new skill from their college education and go back to their own country to help increase the technical skills there. Anyway, their Visa is up 90 days after graduation. It is time for them to go home . . .
