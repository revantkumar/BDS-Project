I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. So many foreign students were contributing to the development of U.S..

3. I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is a good length for OPT program. Based on the information got from classmates, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.
