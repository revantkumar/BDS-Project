I Strongly support this proposal. Extending STEM programs to 24 months will increase the US economy by having the talent people work in US. International students are not taking US citizen jobs but filling up the extra needed skilled workers in the technology industries.In our college, all American citizen got the job first then employers started to hire International students. This is because the demand of STEM workers is higher. 
- By Extending more time for STEM program will ensure that the skills obtained from US colleges are used effectively to facilitate the growth of technology and innovation in US.
-Also this will be an opportunity to provide more training and experience for international students which will help them to apply what they have been learning in the college and change the rest of the world.
