Harsh Parekh I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

I pursued a Masters degree in Information Systems from University of Cincinnati and graduated in 2013. The decision of removing STEM OPT extension will abruptly end my current work authorization in Feb 2016. It will not even allow my employer a chance to file H1-b work visa for me. My wife (who works in US) and I are completely baffled about our future due to this decision.

This new proposal to retain and expand the STEM OPT extension is quite a relief since it provides me more time to continue my learning experience in the most technologically advanced part of the world. Id like to quote some numbers to indicate the economic benefits of retaining international students in the United States by each phase:

1.Student tenure:
a.Revenue from nonimmigrant visas in the year 2013 assuming a $300 visa application fee for 9.1 million nonimmigrant visas issued is $2.7 billion. This number grew by 2.6% from 2012 to 2013

b.Tuition fees for international students is almost twice than domestic students. Assuming an average of $25,000 / year in just tuition, for 900,000 international students in 2013-2014 accounts for $22.5 billion. This number grew by 8% from the prior year.

c.Apart from my tuition expenses I spent on an average of $500/month in living/food/travel in Cincinnati. For 900,000 students that would be $5.4 billion in additional spending. Note that this is a very low average compared to larger and more expensive Metro cities like Chicago, New York and Boston where 45% of international students study. So the actual number would be even higher.

2.STEM extension tenure:
a.In a city like Cincinnati my average monthly spending on lifestyle/living is around $2500. That accounts for $2.25 billion in additional cashflows in the US just by letting international students continue to work
b.Note that we neither pay nor receive any social security or Medicaid/medicare benefits on a student visa however we still pay all the state, city and federal taxes like any other U.S. citizen. 

Id like to conclude my comment by saying that international students have a huge economic impact on the country. I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. 

Sincerely,
Harsh
