I support the new 24 month new OPT rule.

5 years ago I rejected offers from England and Australia and choose United State to continue my Ph.D study in Computer Engineering. One of the most important reason is because U.S. allows STEM students to have the opportunity of after-school training up to 29 months. If the OPT is only 1 year. It is really hard to say what my decision will be. I believe this is also an issue with most of the STEM students who are preparing to study abroad around the world.

STEM opt is no doubt beneficial to U.S. education system, and it serves the purpose of education -- to make qualified worker for this country, for the world. Student choose U.S. and pay a lot of money to study here. They trusts by going though U.S. college study they will be rewarded. Now we are telling them sorry I can't give you the best education, not because we can't do but we are reluctant.

After this, who will keep trusting us anymore?
