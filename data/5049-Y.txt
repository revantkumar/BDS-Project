Gilbert Pond I oppose the new DHS OPT program rule. It would allow corporations to preferentially hire foreign citizens, students or graduates over their American Citizen couterparts! It actually incentivizes this hiring practice by creating no requirement to pay either minimum wages nor prevailing wages in addition to not having to pay payroll taxes for OPT qualifying individuals, which amounts to corporate welfare. Welfare was never intended for corporations already enjoying significant profits and we need to stop underwriting corporations. Whether public or private, companies are intended to compete. The OPT rule, as well as its extension is essentially a form of immigration policy, which does not fall under the purview of either DHS for our governments Executive Branch--having never been approved by the Congress or the People, it is therefore illegal. Further, this nation's immigration policy must be tempered to not only help our businesses and our economy; but also to protect our citizens--something which DHS and our current Administrations has grossly failed to understand or respect.

I have 2 sons in college, both studying in STEM fields. What do you think their impression of this new (or even the original) OPT policy is? Immigration policy in this country has been handled so poorly in recent years that, among current American graduates in STEM fields, fewer than 47% of them can find work in the field for which they trained! Yet DHS and our current Administration want to make it easier for foreigners/aliens to get these jobs, instead of American citizens/graduates. This absurd policy needs to stop! It is nothing less than insane!
