Kevin Chen I totally support this rule.
Some people may says the STEM extension of OPT would allow international students to "steal" the job from US people, but the real things is that students in STEM extension period are also allowed to work in e-verified company, which means that international students would have the same pay as US people and they will also need to pay tax as US people. There would be no chance for e-verified company to hire low cost people. I worked for Oracle American Inc for more than one year, I can tell you that nearly 1/3 on my annual income as been reduced as tax to American government! And OPT is just a temporary status, most of them will switch to H1B Visa if they still want to work in the US, when they get H1B Visa, they need to pay Social Security Tax, or Medical Tax, which will have no bad effects on the income of IRS! The low cost workers is mainly because the abuse use of H1B Visa, not from the Opt.
Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.
