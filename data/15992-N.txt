We do not need to bring in foreign workers to train for jobs in this nation. We have plenty of American workers to do these jobs

They need to cancel this program and train Americans and completely forget this program which imports workers when we have many unemployed people here who would be glad to do these jobs.

Take care of Americans before you import a lot of unvetted people.We have no idea if these people are radical and will become terrorists when they get to our country.
