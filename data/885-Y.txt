I strongly support this extension rule. First of all, the powerfulness of this country is because the USA attracts the most talented people all over the world. Without this extension, the USA would lose her attraction. Second, the international students have made huge contributions to this country after their graduation. Since the USA has already spent a lot of money on the education of the international students, why not let them make contributions to the USA instead of other countries. Third, the international students are just a small portion compared with the whole labor force of the USA, it wouldnt affect the job market of the USA much.
