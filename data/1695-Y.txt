Xingzhu Wu I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. Students who get education in US should have the chance to work here and more time to make contribution. Or it's just a waste of US education resource.
2. More talented foreign people working in US can keep boosting the US economy, which further provides more jobs in various fields.
3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
