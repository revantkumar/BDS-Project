I think a lot of American citizens know that STEM students are in deed making great contributions to the industries of US (especially in computer engineering, electrical engineering), even the guys who call to stop the proposed extension. 
/----------------------/
STEM students are generally well-educated, hard working and dedicated to the belief that this nation, the United States of America, is a place for dreams, which are called the American Dreams -- the opportunities for prosperity and success achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers.
/----------------------/
They take the opportunities and making more wealth for this nation, and maybe more opportunities for others. The STEM students in companies solving engineering problems based on what they have learnt in undergraduate and graduate years. They are exactly making profit for their employers. They live in the US everyday and supporting the Asian supermarkets, Chinese restaurants and even the real estate.
/---------------------/
So from my point of view, the proposed extending on training opportunities for STEM students is exactly a rule that for benefits of the nation.Failure of this proposed rule may do harm to the development of university diversity, university research, engineering companies. If the rule fails, international students may go to other countries for their abroad study and future career, which will results in less students and researchers in undergraduate or graduate schools, therefore less high quality candidates for the industries. Without the new blood, I think the Reindustrialization will be even more difficult!
