I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. The government should encourage the students who gained advanced degrees in STEM areas in the US to contribute to the related industries in the US with their knowledge and skills. The high quality labor force for the STEM fields is frequently lacking if merely employing US citizens. The 24-month OPT policy allows the international students to make their contribution to advance the STEM fields in the US and help to keep US leading science and technology in the world. A number of the comments here stating the proposal would increase competition in the job market for US citizens. However, this kind of competition, if exists, should in fact boost the quality of the labor force in STEM fields and thus benefiting the entire US.
