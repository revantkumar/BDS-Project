The proposed rule should be undoubtedly SUPPORTED! 

Firstly, The STEM students are helping our economy to create more jobs, instead of stealing our jobs!!! It's a shame to say they are stealing our jobs, without them, our country will suffer!!!

Besides, if some so-called "Citizens" don't want foreigners to be trained in US, how about close our boards to any foreign countries. In that case, our children will have jobs since no foreigners any more??? So NAIVE! 

I think It's better for us to be well trained, well educated in order to get the jobs that we want. Not to blame on the foreigners. 
I totally agree on this rule, and wish our country a better one.
