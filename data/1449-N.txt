The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.

We should enforce the immigration laws that are already on the books and require the U.S. employers to advertise their vacant jobs for at least six months to allow only U.S. citizens to apply and be interviewed for those jobs. Then and only then, if the jobs can't be filled by hiring U.S. citizens, the employers must certify that they can't fill the vacant positions with the hiring of U.S. citizens and request permission to hire foreign students.
