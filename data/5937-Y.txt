I definitely support the proposal.

Most international students coming to the U.S. are among the best of their peers, they come here for Wall Street banks, Silicon Valley companies and so on. Compared with the pressure they put on the job market, the future value they will add to this society is much greater. Imagine a Goldman Sachs associate who cannot work just because he or she did not get the work permission, how much will GS, and U.S. economy lose? Maybe several millions a year.
