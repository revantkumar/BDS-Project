Jitou Du I strongly support the extension of STEM OPT.

If it is passed, there's a lot of people could benefit from it.
1. University can be more attractive.
2. Company can hire more talented people.
3. Student can get more experience
4. With more students, landlord can get more money.

If it's not passed, nobody get benefit.
