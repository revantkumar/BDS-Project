My name is Jonathan Melchor. I am professional from Mexico and currently a graduate student at MIT. I highly support the extension to of the OPT. There are so many talented individuals that want to support the progress of this country and they deserve an opportunity to do so. In addition, it gives more time to companies to consider their candidates for potential sponsorship.
