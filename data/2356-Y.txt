To whom it may concern,

I am an American. I run a startup in the Bay Area which employs both Americans and International students on F1 OPT. All of them have contributed to the company much more than expected. Do I look at their nationality when I hired them? No, absolutely not. I hire by best talent, but not by where they come from. I believe the OPT extension proposal (No. ICEB-2008-0002) is one of the best policies that could possibly keep the US economy competitive. Like a company, this country should also adopt the policy to keep the best talent from the world within its borders.

All of my F1 OPT hires are highly talented and bring in the innovation and the diversity we need. They have been through the best education system in the world. In fact, they are from some of the best schools in the States. This is especially valuable to the US economy considering the massive shortage of engineers and hiring difficulty of STEM talents. A lot of times, I just couldn't get enough competitive American candidates to interview. What we should do is to keep the best international talents and get them to contribute to the US economy, but not drive them home. 

I am against the notion of "international students stealing jobs of Americans". The international hires in my company are all well paid, matching a competitive startup salary and equity package in the Bay Area. They earned what they've got with their professionalism and skills. This country should reward people like them who go the extra mile to stay competitive. 

We are a society of immigrants. Immigration fuelled our prosperity. We should do what we can to keep the tradition that have been proven again and again over the past hundred years. I support this proposal to pass. God bless America.

Thank you
