I strongly support this rule but at the same time I have few recommendations that can be considered to make this rule a win-win for everyone involved:
1. Set up a regulatory framework that would protect the F1 OPT students against fraud, unfair treatment, and lower wages by the employers because of lack of prevailing wage requirements and some of the requirements that apply to H1B applicant. 
2. The proposed regulation should ensure that US workers are given a first priority in hiring before F1 OPT student is hired for the same skill set.
3. Administration should work with the Congress to expand the H1B program in order to provide continuity to F1 OPT students to remain in the jobs after the OPT period expires and help US companies retain the competitive edge on the global stage.
4. The overall goal of this policy should be to attract the best talent from all over the world, provide them an environment to foster so that it continues to make the United States of America a global leader in research and innovation.
