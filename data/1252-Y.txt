The OPT STEM extension program has served as an excellent way to keep American educated ,top talents in the US market over the past years. With the competition for talent intensifying with China, India, Brazil and Europe, America needs these highly educated and trained folks to contribute towards the American economy. The US economy is poised for amazing growth in the information, hi-tech manufacturing and renewable energy sectors and this is a way for USA to keep the talent here. With the H1-B process becoming more convoluted and no preference being given to American educated foreign nationals, this 24-month extension will ease the drain that has been happening for the past two years where educated, highly skilled workers leave the country even when employers want to keep them here. The companies, the economy and in turn the people will benefit greatly by absorbing as many highly skilled workers as possible. 

In fact, it wouldn't be too far fetched to say that in the next year, more than 400,000 applications might be received for the 85,000 H1B visas. Many of these for non American university educated folks from India who are taking the place of middle skilled Americans. The folks who are educated in the American universities , which happen to be the best in the world, are top notch and need to be kept here. These people perform job functions that are highly skilled and cannot be performed by the cheap labor from India that is flooding in due to the companies like Tata Consultancy and Infosys. This is kicking more and more American educated foreign nationals out of the country, when in fact the regulation needs to be happening in the middle skilled sectors to protect American jobs.

In conclusion, the OPT extension program needs to be for 36 months instead of 24 to keep the skilled work force here in the US.
