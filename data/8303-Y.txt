To whomsoever it concerns,

I am a graduate international student studying at the University of Texas at Dallas. The extension of OPT is really important for us who own an American dream. With the extension, we may have three chances to access to H1B Visa which legalizes us to stay and work here, helping a lot for us to achieve our dreams. I request you to kindly consider extending OPT. I know I'm speaking on behalf of the millions of international students in the US.
