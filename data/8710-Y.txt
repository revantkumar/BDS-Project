In the 21st century, the competition between countries is the competition between talents. U.S. has attracted large amount of talented students from all over the world for its advanced education system. Giving work authorization to these students is a way for the U.S. government and people to attract these talents to stay and contribute to the science and economy of this country. 

It is not about paying lower salary to international employees. Instead, it is about no matter how much you are willing to pay, it is extremely hard to find qualified talents. Talents are worldwide scarce resources. Pushing the world's top talents back to their home country will hurt the future of U.S. in the long term.

I'm about to get my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science here at U.S. The OPT extension will benefit myself if I choose to work in the U.S. for a couple of years. However, I don't care if the U.S. government will give us work authorization or not. Tons of openings and opportunities are there back to my home country, China. My country and people are eager to attract abroad talents to work back home. It is no longer the time when immigrants are begging to stay in U.S., especially for talents with advanced degrees.

Impeding students with STEM degrees from working in the U.S. hurts nobody but the U.S. economy and long term development.
