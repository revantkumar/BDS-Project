I strongly support this new rule. United States is an immigrant country, it attract people all over the world due to all kinds of good rules, and this is the main reason makes why U.S the most strongest in the world. Also, U.S. citizens will not take certain jobs usually done by foreign workers, and most of those job is done by the students with STEM degrees. I can not image what will happens to the american's econom if this rule got cancelled.
