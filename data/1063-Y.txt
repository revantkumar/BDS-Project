As a foreign student desiring to find a job in US, I deeply understand the impact of amendment on my future career. Most of those, including myself never to consider even to become a permanent resident. we just want to accumulate some experience working in american and go back to our motherland at the end. 2 years's working authority is perfect for us, not to short, not to long to enrich our career. Since we have a definite goal, we are tend to work harder and devote more to the companies working for. And we will not harm the job opportunities of other americans.
