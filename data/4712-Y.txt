Dear Mr. Johnson:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I graduated from Texas A&M University, College station this May in STEM field. Many of TAMU graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. we will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
I am planning to gain my training experience here in the US and use it when i go to my country.

OPT and OPT extension is important because education in US will only help if we can use that education in industry in US.If we are forced to leave back by vacating the OPT and OPT extension, then the education in US will be useless. The time and money we spent will go in vain. It will affect our career and life in a very negative way.

I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best regards,
