This is definitely a great proposal as information technology is currently the engine of the economic growth in U.S and most of the IT companies are largely relying on talented international students with degrees in engineering and technology from top U.S universities. This is exactly how american dreams are achieved with talented people from across the world come to this nation, contributed to is prosperity and finally became citizens here. I strongly support the approval of this proposal.
