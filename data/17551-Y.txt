I support this new OPT extension rule. I have been working for three companies during the last several years. I meet many international employees and I know how they make a contribution to the US industry with their talents and diligence. Lots of high-tech companies need people like them. 12 months' OPT is really too short for them to get familiar with a new position and create something new. This new OPT extension rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and the international students.
