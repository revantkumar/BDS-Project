Jin Li I think the policy of 24 months STEM extension is very important to attract talents from all over the world to the US and make a contribution to the US science, technology, and economy. I am a postdoctoral scholar right now, and as far as I know, most US PhD students are not willing to do postdoctoral training due to the low salary and long working hours, and a majority of postdocs in my department are foreign students. Most of the research project in biology related fields take a long time to complete. Without the 24 months of extension, the projects can hardly be completed. It will slow down the progress in scientific research if the foreign postdocs are forced to leave US upon the original 12 months of STEM ends. Furthermore, without the 24 months extension, many foreign students applying for a bachelor or master degree will choose other countries instead of US, which will result a huge loss of income for US universities since the tuition of bachelor/master makes a large part of the income for universities.
