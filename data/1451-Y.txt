I am a telecommunications engineer working for one of the top IT companies in the US. I am on my H1B work visa. I am in favor of this rule as F1 students are all very talented and skilled individuals who can contribute to the development of technology and IT industry in the United States. This would be beneficial for the students who will get a chance to obtain practical training in their field and in turn utilize their skills and knowledge for the company's and in turn the country's economic and technological development.
