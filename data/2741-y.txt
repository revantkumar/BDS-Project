Will Pan Strongly support this new rule. 

1) US benefit a LOT from the foreign workforce, especially high-tech industry.

Most of alien students/employees are top in their original countries and they work/ study here, making BIG contribution to the US ECONOMY as well as Academic, it's a Win-Win. If we are driven home, America will definitely lose great people to contribute to American dream. It won't really hurt us, but I am pretty sure it would cause big loss at country level to this nation. 

2) Opportunity always favors diligence. 

I understand those people who disagree this proposal because of their concern that International students may take their job. But I do not think this should be their real concern if they are smart enough, work hard enough. No one can take the job that belongs to them. 

For the job opportunity, it always goes to whoever proves better and more suitable, more importantly, can make better contributions. That is to say, whoever has better skill set or any potential traits to be a better employee, who is actually contributing to the American industry/ economy. 

In a nutshell, I support this new rule to benefit the development of the nation.
