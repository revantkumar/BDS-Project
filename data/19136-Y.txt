I do not understand why we still pull people from other countries when we have many very qualified students from this country who need these jobs and have gone on to other fields because they cannot get into the field of their choice. I am so disenfranchised from my own government seeking to hire those from outside this once great nation. If you do not support your own people then you are not a good government. It feels as though no one is listening.

Seriously, Linda Miller
