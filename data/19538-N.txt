I am shocked and appalled by aspects of the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand that have recently come to my attention:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
Futhermore, there are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers. 

Not only is this OPT practice devastating to American workers, it is financially destructive to the US economy. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

Please explain to me in detail how you plan to fix these and other problems caused by this Department of Homeland Security proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT).

Thank you.
