I am an international student pursuing a STEM degree. However, I am not writing this comment solely for my own convenience of practical training after graduation. I have several teenager cousins who are choosing from US, Canada, UK for the destiny of higher education. They are all talented, creative, and hardworking. My advise for them mumbled a bit in the past few months, due to the uncertainty in the future of OPT extension. I have no doubt that a more friendly OPT schedule (a longer one, for sure) will benefit all interested parties, including universities (and other education service), local economy (especially around college towns), international students for sure, and even for local Americans seeking jobs (one of my classmates, also an international student, started a start-up that hires a dozen of local workers). I would like my voice heard by the States, as well as by those who share different views from me, as they might also be benefiting from an OPT extension.
