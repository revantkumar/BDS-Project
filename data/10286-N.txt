This is absurd, plenty of legal U.S. citizens need jobs, take a look at the real unemployment rates, not the administrations cooked up rates. Please let legal graduates, our own sons and daughters receive these jobs, Lord knows they or their parents have paid dearly for their education, now let them put it to good use, instead of going into the unemployment lines. Thank You, Bob Ross
