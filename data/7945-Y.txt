Extend OPT to 24 minth help to keep more highly educated international students. I live in idaho, only 10% of population here have bachelor's degree. It is hard to hire people with A degree of BS or above from the local jobmarket. I work for research & development department for a food company. We hire a lot of non-US citizen scientists who are holding OPT or OPT extension visa. More than half of the scientists in my department are orginally from other countries (are or were former international students), including our VP and director. They are intelligent, hardworking and brought diverse insights to our group. We need the diverse insights that stem from their cultural background. Without OPT extension, we are facing a crisis to lose these talents and lose diversity. so i strongly support extend opt to 24 month.
