Christopher Georgen I believe that it is incredibly important that we extend the time international students can stay in the US after graduation. It seems absurd that we expend our resources educating foreign students and then almost immediately send them back to their home countries before they have had the opportunity to put that education to work benefiting the American economy.

One of the primary arguments against allowing longer stays for international graduates is that it hurts the job prospects for US citizens. While it possesses a great deal of emotional resonance for many voters, it in fact does not make any logical sense. If it is true that international students are truly better qualified for available jobs, then it also follows that they are better qualified to produce new jobs in the form of helping start and expand American businesses. By producing new jobs, these students do not present a detriment to foreign workers and do present a major benefit to the US economy.
