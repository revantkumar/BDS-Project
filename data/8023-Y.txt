I'm an international student in New York State. Though I'm not a student with a STEM degree, I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

First, some people say that those students who will get the STEM degrees may reduce the native students' job opportunities of who don't have the STEM degrees. However, according to the law, international students who apply for the OPT could only find major related jobs. For example, a student with a computer science degree can not get a teaching job during his OPT. So those companies won't and cannot hire those students who have the STEM degrees to do job that not related to their major. Therefore, students who have STEM degrees won't make those students without STEM degrees harder to find the job.

Second, as I know, lots of my friends no matter they have or don't have the STEM degrees who will apply for the OPT are just want to supplement their academic experience with practical experience in order to improve their own professional aptitude. They are going back to their own country when OPT expires. So even if those students may increase the competition of job hunting for those american students who have the STEM degrees, it won't lasts long.

Last, I don't think the increase of job competition is a bad thing for US society. Youngsters who live in a competence circumstance would make them more creative and stronger. Competition will prosper USA.
