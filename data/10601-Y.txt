As an F-1 student, thanks to the OPT and extension policy, I have been working for a large tech company in California for months. I've helped my team and the company accomplished several important projects. I strongly believe that I have made more contribute for the company, and for this country than I got paid fiscally. In the meantime, I truly learned so much here that I would love to stay here for a longer period time. It is a win-win for both the tech-company and this country. And this extension policy will make everything even better!
