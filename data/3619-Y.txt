Hao Wang This rule not only benefit the F1 students but also the whole country in the long run. We are short of STEM professional, and we spent huge resources to educate our next generation STEM students. If these students all go back to their country, this will cause adverse consequence. However, if we provide a good environment for the students to stay, they will create big value for our country. Therefore, I believe this policy is a long lasting good policy for the whole country.
