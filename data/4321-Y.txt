I strongly agree with this proposal with the following reasons:
First, as an international student, the OPT and STEM OPT Extension after obtaining a degree in the U.S. is the main reason for me to select the U.S. to study abroad. I can accumulate precious working experience through the 2~3 years OPT and STEM OPT Extension, and the experience will pave my way to find a decent job in China when I go back to China in a few years. If we dont have the STEM OPT Extension, I can only find a job as a fresh master when I go back to China. Then thatll be a waste of the huge amount of tuition fees I spend in the U.S.

Second, the working projects I involved in are long term projects. The regular OPT is not long enough for us to participate in any projects. And no employer accepts hiring someone who can work no more than a year. The STEM majors lack of American students, nearly all of my classmates are international students. If the STEM OPT Extension doesnt exist, itll be a huge loss for the employers. The employers couldnt find enough qualified employees. 

Third, my salary isnt lower than american colleagues, so theres no bad competitions happened. My American colleagues asked for my help when they face difficulties in their work. I performed pretty well as a team member. 

We, international students work in the U.S. with the OPT and STEM OPT Extension, create wealth for the U.S. society and play an important role in STEM major related jobs and companies.
