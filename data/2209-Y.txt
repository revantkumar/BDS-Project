USA is an immigrants' country. It is her legacy, and what she shall be to keep her at the top of the world. Giving more time to the qualified graduates to let them contribute to the greatness of this country, and then probably adsorbing them as new members, will only make USA stronger. 

If you check the identity of students and professors in most STEM departments, you'll find a VERY BIG part of them come from outside of USA. We are doing the dirty work that most US people don't want to do, tedious calculation, experiments, deep theories, and we want to fulfill our American Dream through our hard working. 2 years OPT is a nice way to test and screen out the top immigrants.
