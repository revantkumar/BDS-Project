I strongly support this proposal since it's beneficial to U.S. economy and U.S. citizens in three ways. 

First of all, international students are bringing a large amount of tuition payment to U.S. colleges and universities. Colleges and universities can invest these money to improve their education and researches and make themselves more competitive. Since OPT extension is one of the major reasons why international students choose the colleges in U.S., the colleges and universities in U.S. will be less attractive to them if there is no OPT extension and the benefit of the colleges and universities will be hurt. 

Secondly, international students have a lot of expenditures in U.S. during their study here. They contribute a lot to different industries as they rent apartments, buy cars and go shopping when they are in U.S.. So their expenditures maintain many industries prosperous and create more employment opportunities to U.S. citizens. 

Besides, they provide high quality employment to many high-tech companies. These high-tech companies need huge amounts of employees and U.S. citizens can't fill up all of these vacancies. The high-tech companies will be harmed if international students don't have the OPT extension. They will have a lot of positions which can't be filled up. So international students also maintain the development of U.S. companies and competitiveness in high technology. 

Some objector thinks this proposal will harm the U.S. workers. Quite the opposite, international students create a lot of employments for U.S. workers as their large expenditures in U.S. which increase the U.S. economy. Besides, since there are so many vacancies in the job markets which can't be filled up by U.S. citizens, international students help to fill up these positions without taking jobs from U.S. citizens. 

Overall, I support this proposal which is beneficial to the U.S. economy, U.S. education system and U.S. citizens.
