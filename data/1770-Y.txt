Support!!! Many F-1 students encountered rejections when they are looking for jobs simply because they are F-1 studentsnot a citizen or green card holder. This block out a lot opportunities for F-1 students since most companies don't support H1b visa. The U. S.government claims that they welcome talent people to contribute to this country. But without opt extensionmany F-1 students with STEM degrees have to leave U.S. after graduation. Plus, some other countries are offering much better benefits to attract talents which has been caused a lot of talents loss in U. S..If no better immigration policy is offering in near future, talents loss would be much worse.
