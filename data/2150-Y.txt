America is a nation of immigrants, since it was created by immigrants and for immigrants. The extension of OPT visa will NOT cause influx of illegal immigrants of any type mentioned in some other comments, it is a LEGAL, non-immigration type visa on training purpose for new graduates. On the other hand, the training for higher degree foreign students would bring considerable benefits and enough talents for US industries in technology and scientific research, which helps to ensure the leader role in the world for the whole nation. 

OPT visa workers would NOT take the job away from US citizens, since it is a temporary visa, every firm in US would hire an equal-qualified citizen over any visa worker. For job positions in government, security and military related fields, OPT visa workers would NOT even be considered, whereas citizens have 100% advantage to get these jobs.

Without extension, OPT visa workers would only be able to train for one year, which is far from enough since most of the positions in US science and technology industry require at least one year of hand-on experience. Usually, new graduates need one year of internship and then have the actual chance to apply for full-time positions. 

In summary, I here support the extension rule without reservation.
