It is a great idea to implement. It will allow non-immigrant students to get more experience. USA will also benefit from the fact that in order to solve a problem, there will be people from different culture, different background, different thought process sitting on a table brainstorming together to contribute to the society of STEM. Extending the STEM OPT and CapGap Relief will give more time for foreign students to amalgamate with people from here and work together to achieve success. It is a win-win for both, the country and the non-immigrants.
