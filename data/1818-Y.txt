I strongly support the new OPT extension, and I really want to clarify some common misunderstanding that STEM students gets lower pay to steal jobs from domestic workers that I frequent saw in a lot of negative comments: 

OPT and OPT extension are DIFFERENT from H1B in OPT and OPT extension are only offered to students certificated with degree of college or graduate school from well established universities, which is unlike H1B which can be applied and given to anyone. This is very important, because it implies these STEM students are either very talented who usually came to U.S with a merit-based full ride scholarship or have good financial support from their family in that they are able to afford their tuition which is roughly around 25k ~ 50k dollars every year. (As a side note, tuition for international students are usually 3-4X higher than domestic students especially for public universities, and international students are NOT eligible for student loans from banking). Actually in most cases, they are BOTH very talented and with good financial family background. 

So please don't confuse international STEM students with somebody suffering a poor life back in their hometown and therefore have no other choice but to came to U.S and be willing to take whatever they are given just to stay. STEM students don't come to U.S for survival, instead they came for widening their eyesight, meeting potential "business partner", and challenging themselves with the best (and also the most expensive) education world can offer. They see U.S an exciting stage where they are learn from world-class professors, work for world-class companies, and meet with world-class successful people. And please remember this is not because U.S is just granted with most talented people but because it is country capable to ATTRACT those talented people from all over the world. After STEM students graduate, as I have indicated before, they usually get employed (and work for like 10 hours a day...) f
