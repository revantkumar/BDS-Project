We do not need to import more workers for tech jobs for the following reasons:

1. There are over 2 million unemployed residents of the U.S. with a bachelor's or higher STEM degree.
2. There are about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties, many of whom would return to those fields with appropriate incentives.
3. The OPT foreign workers will displace graduating Americans who are struggling to repay massive student loans.
4.By turning the F-1 student visas into 3 year work visas, DHS is doing an end around Congressional limits on H-1b 3 year work visas.
5. There are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas, yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields.
6. Big Tech lobbyists have spent over $1 billion seeking immigration increases, but Microsoft & Hewlett Packard are laying off tens of thousands of employees. 

It is shameful that our government officials succumb to lobbyists & special interest group pressure in order to shift jobs away from Americans. No business ethics or morals. Capitalism at its worst to feed the greed of business execs!
