I strongly agree with the 24-month STEM OPT extension. If the skilled immigrates own a longer OPT time, they will be more likely to choose and be accepted by some growing stratups. And those growing startup will be the reason why the US government gain its power in the future. Besides, as I know, over half foreign students come to study in USA because of the OPT policy, since they could gain some practical industry experience here after the academic study. If the OPT policy gets even shorter, there must be a giant reduction for people choosing USA to study.
