I support the proposal of F-1 OPT extension. 

I am currently working in the national laboratory in USA with F-1 OPT status. I support the OPT 24 months extension due to some reasons:

1: My phd program was supported by America government. This program trained me a lot of knowledge and enriched my background which I think I could do a lot to benefit the America society. Now I am doing such contribution. Without this OPT extension, I have to end this contribution once my current status expired. And my supervisor will have to spend more time and money finding someone else to replace me. I think government spend a lot of fund in school, in which most of the fund were supported to PHD program. I think the government will not allow such PHD students will contribute to other countries by using the knowledge they gain from America. 

2: I know a lot of parents outside the USA want to send their children to USA for good education. If they know the opportunity of on-the-job educational experience will eliminated, they will consider their decision. One of them is my uncle. If the OPT extension has to been stopped, i think my Uncle will reconsider whether sending his child here to receive the education since the post-graduation-work education is still important.
