I fully support the F1 OPT STEM rule because they are lot of stem people who are done with they education and want to utilize this period for they future on what receive from knowledge. This is also imperative to maintain USA economic, scientific and technological competitiveness. So, I further support the new idea of expending the F1 OPT STEM period from 24 months from 17 months.
