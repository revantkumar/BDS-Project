Karim Kazemi Bidokhti I have a phd in structural engineering and currently working in structral company in Nyc. I am currently on post-completion Opt. In order to continue working, I would need the Opt Stem extension since the getting H1-b visa is not guaranteed. The Opt extension is hugely vital for many international students who are working in US.
