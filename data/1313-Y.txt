The OPT status for F1 STEM students is an invaluable supplement to the currently highly limited H1B visa system. The proposed extension will benefit the employers, tax-payers and the government of the United States in both the short and long run. 

Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, these are key areas of competition in the 21st centaury. Keeping the highly educated STEM talents in the US and proving them an opportunity to serve in this country plays a critical role for maintaining the global leadership of this country. A creative country will never have "enough" STEM talents who play critical roles in the US high-tech industry. The more STEM employees available in the market, the easier for a US entrepreneur to start a new business and get success --- thus leading to more job opportunity in a whole. In addition, most of these STEM F1 students obtained their US education with (some) financial support from the US education system (i.e. the tax-payers money), extending the OPT period for these students serving in the US industry will give the US government a better opportunity to recover the earlier investment. 

In short, the current propose is in accordance with the National Interest of the United States and should be strongly supported.
