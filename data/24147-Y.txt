I firmly stand by this policy to expand the period of OPT to 24 month for the following reasons:
Firstly, the extension policy of OPT will give STEM students more opportunity to get trained in American companies. These international STEM students are more talented that can bring higher economic effectiveness to the companies.
Secondly, the extension policy of OPT brings more international students to America for study. Last year, more than 800,000 international students came to America for study, which contributes to the growth of local economy. Their expense on tuition and living fee tremendously promotes local economy. This kind of industry chain is indispensable to the whole nation.
Thirdly, some people may hold the opinion that the extension of OPT may result in the lost of job opportunity of native Americans. I sniff to this statement. Opportunity should be left to the more competitive students who will bring more benefits to the company and the whole society.
In summary, the extension policy not only benefits the companies but also the nation in a wide range.
