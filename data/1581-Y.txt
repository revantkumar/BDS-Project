It's wise to give more international students and workers opportunities to work in US. As an immigration country, US has always been the first destination for talents all over the world. While them contributing their hard work to build this country a better place, native born Americans are also beneficiaries. Without foreign work force pushing forward US economy, this country will suffer a great set back and is all the Americans citizens to lose. 

Two hundred years ago, millions of people around the globe came here and built this great country from nothing, during these years, this land has been profiting for being the biggest immigration country of the world. There is no reason why now should be a turning point.
