I highly support for this proposal.
It is a remarkable idea to give an 24 month extension.

First, it will increase the strength of US and benefits general people who live in US.
The salary of H1B holders are much more than American's average salary. They pay tax much more than normal American. As a result, the government has more money to offer welfare to the poor and others.
They can build a better medical system, build infrastructures, reduce poverty and support for interesting scientific research.

Then, it also benefits the academy. As a student with computer science major, out academic projects usually take more than two years. With the help of new extension, we don't have to worry about a early termination of our academic projects and keep going. These positions usually require high educated students but payment is less. These students would like to keep working for academic area rather than working in industry. They fall in love with science and academic field. With help of these people, science and technology of America will get progress quickly. American did that before and became most powerful country in the world. Now America need more talented people like that since STEM fields are more complicated than before. Getting a good result needs more people to work together. Thus, the extension should be much more important than that before. 
According my person experience, the last four researches related to computer science are three years or fours years. Never less than that. My projects are usually two to three years. Thus it is reasonable to extend the opt of stem students.
