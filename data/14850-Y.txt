As an employee in IT industry, I support this proposal. 
The IT industry is increasingly developing and more people needed to support this development. For our company, international students with STEM degrees are the best choice. These new graduates are hard-working, and efficient in learning and solving problems. With their ambitions and advanced knowledge, our company is becoming better. We did't intend to hire only international students, but few U.S. citizens were applying for engineering positions. 
At the same time, some international students left U.S. after the OPT period, because they eventually wanted to work at their own countries. I think extending the OPT for STEM students doesn't mean we make U.S. citizenship worth less. We can use this extension to make excellent international students become U.S. citizens, and it is beneficial for the development of our country. After all, U.S. is an immigrant country as we all came from another country at the very beginning. If we abandon diversity, we will lose the foundation of our country.
As a U.S. citizen, I think the extension policy can strongly support the technology development of our country.a
