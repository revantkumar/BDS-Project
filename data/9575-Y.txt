I strongly agree that we should have OPT extension! It has nothing to do with the unemployed US citizens. The US students who study STEM find their jobs easily (much easier than foreign students because they're more fluent in English and they don't need visa sponsorship). The foreign STEM students are just devoting themselves to this country. Why keep them away?
