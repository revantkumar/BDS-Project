from all I've heard, employers have been hiring foreign engineers because the foreign workers accept lower pay.

The entire STEM push in education is a FARCE!Most graduates in science, engineering, technology, math are either unemployed or had to find a job out of their field to survive.

I lived next door to a woman who was a math teacher working for a credit union.

Agere, a local company in SE Pa hired foreign engineers, such as Terry Payette from the Schychelles islands off the coast of Eastern Africa!

You can't tell me Agere couldn't locate a qualified engineer w/ lehigh university right here in the same area.

I saw the cell phone video of the convention where the speaker was advising clients to make it look AS IF they exhausted all their methods to find a qualified American.

I saw the on line townhall exchange between Jennifer, whose softwear engineer spouse had been unemployed three years, w Obama. Never saw another on line town hall after that one.
