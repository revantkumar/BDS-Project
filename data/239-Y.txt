Paul Robert I strongly SUPPORT the rule for the following reasons: Firstly, definitely it will benefit the US economy. OPT-extension will help America attracts many talented people with high skill for certain field. They largely contribute to the economic development of US. The IT works in Silicon Valley are great examples. Secondly, it will not affect the US citizens job opportunities. As far as I know, there aren't many American like to learn or are learning STEM majors. And if they are qualified for the job position, they always get hired. Thirdly, it provides the diversities to the companies and the country. The US citizens are benefit from the diversities, by learning the cultures and the ways of thinking of people from other countries.
