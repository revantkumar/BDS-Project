For what reason can't students who ARE citizens of the United States of America be considered and chosen first? Don't you have any faith and belief in their abilities to study, win and become successful professionals? Apparently not, as this proposed legislation would show and allow the opposite to happen. How dare you, members of my own Congress, put the educational needs of non-USA individuals before those that are born here or have citizenship rights by right of parentage.

That is slipshod stewardship, careless concerning opportunities, and heartless in disavowing our children. Shame on the lot of you for even considering this legislation. Each one of you voting for this travesty should be verbally horsewhipped and raked over the burning electorate of legal registered citizen voters on you way out of office.
