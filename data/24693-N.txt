I'd like to add my voice to those who oppose the DHS proposal that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This proposal provides an incentive for companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans. They will avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, which is 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only is that an incentive for companies to hire those students over American workers, it will prevent roughly 1 billion dollars a year from being contributed to the SS fund. I shouldn't have to explain the obvious implications of this. Please oppose this.
