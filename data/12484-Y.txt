I strongly support the extension for the following reasons:

1. America is a country where everyone has equal chance to be successful, by extending the OPT international students will have more chance to show their talent. International immigrates have made great contributions to the innovation and researches in US. 

2. I don't agree that such an extension will threaten the US citizens to get their own jobs. If they want to get a job, they must study and work hard and be excellent, and they also need to learn to face the competition from the others. If you do nothing but still want to get a job, that's won't be good for America too. If you're working hard and excellent, you won't be afraid that international students will take you over.

3. Longer OPT will attract more international students to come to US, thus it's good for US education and economics.
