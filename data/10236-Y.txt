Extension of OPT program for STEM students will affect USA positively. With more talented young people in the job field competing for positions, it will help demonstrate a positive atmosphere in USA job market. It will help both foreign students and USA citizens. 

There is no direct link between job losses and OPT program. I strongly believe extension of this program will help USA become a more attractive place for highly talented young people around the world.
