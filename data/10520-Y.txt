I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. opt stem extension allows international students to contribute themselves to US companies with what they learnt from university.
2. International students will improve the diversity of a US company. Since the global trade is becoming more and more important, to have some employees from overseas will help company to better develop their oversea market. Like my current work, I will need to work with many colleagues from overseas. And I believe my international background helps both my company and myself a lot.
