Here I strongly support the OPT new extension rule. I'm an international Master student major in Computer Science and work as a full-time Software Developer in Cisco. There are many employee who work in their OPT status. We're paid with the same salary as other full-time employees, without any low-payment profit earned by the company.
This season, we our group signed a big contract with LangChao Technology in China, which worth 10billion dollars. So I think the new rule can make us work in our current company more stable and keep make huge revenue to the U.S as well as U.S permanent residents.
Finally, both I and my colleagues plan to move back to our home country(China and India) after the OPT status. So we will not compete with other permanent residents and we will not keep occupy the benefits in U.S. Once we move back to our home country, we will keep work in our company's branch in these countries. So the more experience we have in the U.S, the more competitive we will be in our home country. So that we can better make profit to U.S company.
