I support the proposal for the following reasons:

(1) Students participating in practical training in STEM fields are usually involved in a project which requires several years to complete. For example, in my company, international interns (majored in Math and Computer Science) were involved in a project which includes building up a new database for the whole company, and then developing the corresponding algorithms to move everything on the new platform. This project could not be done in a short time, and it would be time consuming to train new interns to maintain this new system. In this case, we prefer to give international interns an extension on OPT.

(2) International students in OPT period pay taxes to the government, and they also make donations to local charities. At least it is true in my company.
