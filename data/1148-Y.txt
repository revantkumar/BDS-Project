Howard Chen I would like to support this extension. As you may see, there are many immigrants working in key roles of research and development in high-tech companies/research institute. Many of them have most important contribution to US in their fields. Most of those people was also working as OPT/OPT extension students for their further training. They are invaluable treasure to USA and it will be nightmare to let them leave US due to losing work authorization. Thus it is beneficial to keep OPT and OPT extension for sustaining US competitiveness. 

There are many laws and regulations for protecting US workers so there is no need to worry about OPT extension for "occupying" positions of US workers.
