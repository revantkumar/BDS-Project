The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix. Expanding this program from 12 monts to 36 monts will make it more difficult for American colledge graduates to enter into these fields. Companies will take advantage of this program to help themselves by giving foreign workers less wages and not paying payroll taxes on these foreign workers. America's government needs to look out for the interest of Americans above and instead of foreign workers and when all the Americans who want a job have one then we can look at providing employment to foreign workers for a short period of time. Congress and the President were elected to represent the American people first and formost, and it is time that American workers be represented by our own government before foreign workers.
