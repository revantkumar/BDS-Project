1.U.S. Is an immigration country, there's no that much original "Americans" except for the Indians, in that case, it's silly to try to make everyone get out of this country.
2. It's easy to calculate how many latest technology are created by those who were non-American STEM students, and how many by those who are American when they were born. Why should the US government push these people away?
3. Those who try to work in US studied harder in school and can do better in work, why should they pay for those who are party everyday during his school life?
