This rule provides great opportunities for STEM students pursue their passion on their career in the U.S., which will benefits both these students and the U.S. Numerous students who graduate from U.S. universities work in the U.S. based on F1-OPT, who largely contribute to the success of U.S. companies and directly or indirectly create a considerable number of jobs. Therefore, allowing them to work in the U.S. is critical to maintain the success of these companies and the stability of the U.S. job market. Also, this rule will play an important role to ensure the competitiveness of U.S. universities that will attract more talented students to the U.S. As a postdoc researcher, I myself have trained both undergraduate and graduate students along my study, many of which decided to continue pursuing scientific or engineering study. And I notice that a lots of researchers like me, who hold F1 or F1-OPT visa, are providing education to students at various levels (graduate, undergraduate, high-school). Thus, this rule is also important to maintain high-quality education in the U.S., which will ensure a promising future of U.S. Therefore, I fully support this rule and hope it will be validated and applied smoothly, because creating a promising working environment is the key to keep the talented people and strong competitiveness in the U.S.
