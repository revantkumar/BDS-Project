YES! I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension. 

First of all, foreign workers with STEM degrees made huge contributions to our country. They help boost our economy and technology, which also help decrease the unemployment rate, and increase job opportunities in our nation. If we can make them contribute more, why not?

Secondly, it's not the competition between Citizen and Non-Citizen. Actually, they are F1 Non-immigrant Students, who are trying to make a better United States with their intelligent work. It's RIDICULOUS to say they are making our money.

Last but not least, It's everyone in US who makes our country better. As long as they are making contributions, we should hug them. It will be a disaster for us if big IT companies like Google, Facebook losing foreign talents. 

God Bless United States!
