I STRONGLY support this OPT extension. Because we just can't find American citizens or permanent residents for our research project!! If we lose our research assistant, staff scientist because of that. Who is going to do the research for us, for the country?

I am talking about extremely important scientific project funded by NIH and NSF! And not just for my projects, but for a lot of similar ones throughout the countries. These projects usually take years to finish. So an extension of 24 months is not even enough. If we still want to be the research center attracting talents from all over the world, please bring up policies that will keep them stay here. These are not illegal immigrants, these are the good, well-educated people whose skill and knowledge are in huge demand.

Stop talking about the cheap labor thing. These students are well-educated and they get paid as much as others. Or you think the university would allow me to pay an unfair rate to someone without charging me discrimination?
