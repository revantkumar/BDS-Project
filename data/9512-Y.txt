I totally agree on this rule. US, as an emigrant county, has been attracting the most brilliant people from all over the world for dacends. The best students come to US for only one reason: they know they can learn something and have a chance to practice. By shutting down the opt extension, students find no reason to puasude a US degree cause they know they can't practice at all and they can always read book to learn. Meantime, US high tech industry rely on these brilliant talents to maintain leadership over the world and help US maintain the leadership at the same time. But f these people go to other countries or even US competitor or even enemies, they will help those countries and hurt eventually. 
To prevent that from helping, OPT extension is more important even ever.
