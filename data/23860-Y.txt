I strongly agree the extension of STEM OPT. As America is a cultural " melting pot", we can here for study and hope to work here because we like this kind of America which can give every people equal chance for living here. And after the international students graduate, if we get a chance to work here, I believe it will bring a great benefits to American economy. As America is at the period of economic resurgence, it will also need more people to support the market, I think our international student will help a lot.
