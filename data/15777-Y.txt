I believe the OPT extension will not only help to student to get the global exposure in their field. But will also help United States to keep and use their talent. In Unites States the statistics states that in Masters of Engineering . Out of 40 students 85% students are International.
With the help of STEM I believe United States will keep itself at the top position .I believe if the OPT rule in not implemented the International talent will gradually shift from USA.
I believe students are the strenght of Country and keeping its pace and rhythm alive.
The quote which always says in loud "America the Land of Opportunity" .Must not lose its voice in this world of Science & Technology.
So,I firmly believe the OPT Extension rule must be enforced.
