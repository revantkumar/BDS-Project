I am against letting more foreigners into this country to take jobs from our US Citizens. People with High School or less education need the jobs that are being given to foreigners. They have historically used these jobs to work their way thru college and also to make a living for themselves and family. It is totally unfair to bring people in from other countries and give them these jobs as in most cases minimum wage is being paid no matter who does the job.
