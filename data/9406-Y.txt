I strongly and unconditionally support the OPT extension for the benefits of both international students and US citizens. 

Extension for international students in STEM majors would allow more talented students practice their working skills and increase working competence. It is a priority to help them in US, serve for US, so that US would maintain its leading role in technology, engineering, science fields, thus creating substantial opportunities to support a large range of job positions for US citizens as well. 

It is our overarching goal that we must keep the talented, bright, and hard-working international students working for US. Creating chances for them to develop working skills and serve for American needs in developing cutting-edge techniques that would benefit US in a long-term run in leading the world economic role.
