I think it's absolutely right to keep the OPT extension and to further extend it.

STEM students are among the most outstanding intellectuals of their country, to keep them is to keep and improve competitiveness of the U.S.

STEM OPT extension is critical to attract international students to come to the U.S. Without the extension, the education of the U.S. would be much less attractive for international students.

International students, however, is one of the most dominant group that keep a absolute strong purchasing power, to keep them is to help this country's economy.

Without OPT extension, companies are not so likely to hire international students, even though they are sometimes the best applicants to meet companies' needs. Force international students to leave is to deprive their chance to compete, which doesn't match American spirit at all.

To allow longer STEM OPT extension is to further help the U.S. to improve itself. Actually, under 24 months of OPT extension policy, it would be a much better choice for companies to hire international students without giving them sponsorship for H-1B visa. Because 3 years is not only a enough long period for international students to get enough practical training, but also the typical period for current young employees to consider leaving the current company. From this perspective, companies do not need to sponsor international students at all in many cases, which also helps to give job chances back to American citizens back at the same time.

All in all, this 24 STEM OPT extension should be approved because of its consistency with this countrys long term benefits.
