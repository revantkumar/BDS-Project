Steven Hopkins Canceling OPT extension would be a tremendous mistake for U.S. government. United States has a long tradition in attracting technology immigrants and that builds the foundation of the country. STEM graduates are making great contribution to various fields and generating huge profits for U.S cooperation, it is easy to see it by counting how many CEOs, CTOs, tech leaders in Silicon valley and Wall Street were international STEM graduates before. If the STEM extension would not be hold, then it is expected that the number of talented immigrants would reduce significantly and the outcome is the worse economy and more importantly, these immigrants would joint the other countries instead, e.g., China, Russia, Japan
