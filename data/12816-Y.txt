I completely support the STEM extension. It will:
1) attract more foreign students to US for study. US is the most popular oversea education destination since the OPT STEM extension policy. Most foreign students coming to US are from wealthy family so they have strong buying ability which could benefit local economy.
2) reduce labor cost of high tech companies of US. Foreign students who work using OPT are mainly for oversea work experience rather than making a living. They don't quite care about salary as long as they can have valuable work experience.
