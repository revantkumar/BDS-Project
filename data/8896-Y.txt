I strongly support this proposal for the followed reasons:

1. The students from other countries recieved high quality education in the United States, so if they want to keeping making contribution to the U.S. longer than 12 months, there should be an opportunity for them.

2. The U.S. attracts millions talented people from all over the world. This is one of the reason why this country is so powerful. OPT extension is one of their ways to stay here so they can provide their diverse idea to make the U.S. better.

3. As far as I know, at least my foreign classmates who found job in the U.S. doesn't get paid lower than the citizen. We are not trying to use low wage to compete in the job market.
