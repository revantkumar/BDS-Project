I strongly support the expansion of the OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees, since it will greatly contribute to the further development of the U.S.A:

First, definitely, the expansion of OPT will attract the best and brightest from all over the world, which will as a result contribute the U.S. advantage.

Second, U.S. is facing a shortage of great technical personnel. Therefore, F-1 nonimmigrant students will STEM degrees are needed by U.S. 

Besides, with talented foreign people working in U.S, especially in some high-technical area like I.T., it will help to improve the economic status of U.S.

Last but not least, it's American spirit and value to give everyone equal chance. Therefore, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees deserve to have more time to practice their skills and put what they've learnt from class into practice after graduation.

To sum up, the expansion rule should be carried out.
