Extension for STEM OPT by 24 months sounds very promising.

Practical training/learning in any field of study is very important. As a student, I understand 1 year of experience in any field is not enough - this 24 months of additional exposure serves as a platform for hands-on learning in critical stage of our career.

Obtaining this skilled students, who have earned higher degrees in the fields of STEM, also advantages US universities and employers.

I feel this rule, should be put in action as soon as possible.
