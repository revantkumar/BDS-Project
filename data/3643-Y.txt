Without income from other countries' students, American people & their children will must go through rising cost of higher education by themselves!! For long term conditions, Opt extension can broader American human resources without any doubts. American people/citizens will undergo higher price of commodities if F1 students or Opt students are decreasing heavily. Opt extension can give F1 students more help finding great jobs in US which can also bring huge benefits for US companies. No extension, much less chances for F1 students, decreasing number of students studying in US. In this case, it is obviously a very bad situation for US education!
