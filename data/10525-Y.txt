Many negative reviews on OPT extension is based on the misunderstanding that this policy helps foreigners take away Americans' jobs, which perhaps originates from the confusion between OPT and H1B visa. The truth is, OPT extension only helps increase the likelihood of foreign students who major in STEM (rather than other majors such as liberal arts) to obtain an H1B visa, while as long as the annual quota for H1B visa is fixed, no one is taking away Americans' jobs. 

Another misunderstanding is that immigrants are cheap labors. While this is partially true, it does not apply to the F-1 non-immigrant students. This is a group of smart and creative people who are top talents from their own countries, and this is the group of people who are driving the development of science and technology, making America the most powerful country in the world. Why do we want to exile them so that they can make their own countries (China, India) stronger and make America less competitive?
