I am from China and I think extending longer years for STEM is a smart move. It does not only help foreign students who want to stay to stay, but it also helps US retain the treasure intelligent work force in this country. Right now China has a strong wave of students startup, a lot of whom are students who studied abroad. America is losing the talent that you cultivate with your resource. With three years working experience, graduated students have more time to consider if they want to eventually stay in this country.
