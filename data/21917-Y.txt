This country is founded by immigrants. The reason that it remains the world's center of innovation despite its poor STEM education ranking in the world, is that it can constantly attract the best STEM workers from all over the world. OPT gives the foreign students an opportunity to showcase their skill after graduation. It does not guarantee a job and it is under regulation of prevailing wage. Think the work force of this country as a football team, OPT is like keeping a training squad.
I firmly support this proposed rule.
