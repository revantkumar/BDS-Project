Merin Thomas I completely support the proposed extension as it will give more opportunities to F1 students to gain adequate industry experience in their field of study.

Considering my case, where most semiconductor companies require at least 3+ years of experience for most job positions, it is important to get a good and stable head-start in the industry else the education would be for nothing. Moreover, since the US is the design hub for most of these industries, it would make sense to give students more experience to retain them at US companies, rather than subject them to the uncertainties of the lottery system and jeopardize their progress.
