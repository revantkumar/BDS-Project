Excellent policy! More STEM students will help build up US financial industry, hedge fund and technology industry since International students occupied more than half of the financial engineering, statistics, maths and CS programs. Meanwhile, international talents are extremely hardworking and work efficiently by strict deadline. I would suggest another 24 month extension to attract more talents to help build up a better US industry.
