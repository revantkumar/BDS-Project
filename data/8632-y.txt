Xinyue Wang I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:

1. It's obvious how important international students are for US, and those attributes made by international students to US are pretty remarkable. As a CS student, and just took a summer internship in Amazon, I can clearly see how many works done by international employees here. Everyone I know works so hard and create large amount of wealth for US companies. 

2. If this proposal fails at end, it will certainly led to a decrease of hiring of international students. But as we can see, in some majors like CS, international students take a large percentage studying. If we loose these students, it'll be a fault for those IT companies. They cannot find enough new grads for those job position and it'll definitely take bad effect on US economy.
