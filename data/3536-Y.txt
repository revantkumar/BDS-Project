I strongly support this rule.
This rule will help U.S colleges to be more attractive to talented students and become more competitive among the worldwide colleges. I am an international student majoring in STEM and when I decided which college to apply for my M.S. study, the OPT STEM extension here was a strong supporting point which let me know I would have enough time to gain related experience. Then I chose to study here instead of going to European.
