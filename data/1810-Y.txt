International students in STEM are not competing with US citizens in high tech industries.
The number of US citizens in STEM along do not fully satisfy the need of high tech industries. International students 
are complementary to US citizens. US companies hire STEM international students not because they are paid less but because they are well qualified for employers' standards. International students are important for US to maitain her leading role 
of the world's high tech industries. Extension to one year OPT will guarantee longer contributions of international students to high tech industries of the United States.
