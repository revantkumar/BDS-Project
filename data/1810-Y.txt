Anonymous I was a STEM OPT student myself and received 17th extension after my graduation. I just want to point out that it will be a great relief to all the international students if the extension is made for 24th months. Students would get sufficient time to choose their employers with whom they want to work on. Most importantly the employers would also have the opportunity to know about their productivity while they are working on OPT. That would increase America's competitiveness in the 20th century. It does not make sense to force them to leave the country and innovate elsewhere. Please give them the chance they deserve. Thanks.
