Dear Sir or Madam:
I am sincerely agree with the proposal of expanding OPT for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. I have to say this proposal is very good since it brings a lot benefits to the United States. 

First, it can absorb more professional talents with STEM degrees to stay in the United States. They can contribute to America to be better and bring more productivity and values. As far as I know, every year there are a large amount of talents leaving from the United States, because they could not get H1B. That is huge losses for those companies where they are in and also losses for our America. If the Training Opportunities period can be extended, these talents will have more chances to get the H1B, which means they will have more opportunities to benefit this beautiful country.

Second, the extension of OPT can provide more powerful safeguards to industries in various fields to find more suitable talents and staff. For a company, it is not easy to find a very suitable employee. So with the expanding of OPT, American companies will gain more selection.

Third, America is a country with a dream. She absorbs a large number of talents coming here to contribute to the country, since she never refuses people who have a dream. OPT extension gives international students more equal opportunities to realize their dream. That can also give those students more confidences to contribute the United States.
