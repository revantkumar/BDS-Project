The OPT program, to allow foreign students extended access to STEM jobs at less than prevailing wages, accelerates the race to bottom wages and undercuts our Social Securtity. The benefit to those at the top in terms of business cost is similar to the benefit derived from no pay internships. The wealth increase in this nation is unconscionably skewed.

The present college graduate generation's unemployment in the U.S. a is a public cost not only I dollars but in morale and hope. 

National Security is gutted from within if you allow this OPT program. OPT OUT!
