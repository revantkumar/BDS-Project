As the President has highlighted the importance of knowledge based sectors to the economy, it is highly imperative that the polices and regulations are consistent with his thoughts. International students majoring in STEM have huge potential in contributing to the economy. The OPT STEM is a perfect program to realize it. 

Economists have reported time and again the benefits these highly skilled individuals bring to the native population. They are more likely to start a business and generate jobs, they work in high tech industries that are at the forefront of innovations. In short, they help in keeping the US economy at the front. These students bring business to the economy in terms of tuition and living expenditure to the universities and municipals. At times when college enrollment for native population is at an all time low, these students fill in the void and make sure that these institutions of higher learning are afloat.

I fully support the expansion of the STEM OPT program from the current 29 to 36 months. As the DHS mentioned in its draft rule, it should provide guidance if at all the rule making process is not completed before February 12th, 2016. 

The executive action is indeed a temporary measure to solve the impact of our broken immigration system. At the same time, I request the DHS to advocate and continuously press the legislature to pass common sense immigration laws.
