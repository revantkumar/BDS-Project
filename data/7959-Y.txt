LaTisha Jackson It has gotten to the point that U.S. citizen qualified workers are only hired if an OPT worker cannot be found! My brother worked for Home Depot in their IT department as a contractor-to-perm worker and received stellar reviews from his boss, but he was told that he had to turn everything over and train an OPT worker who would be replacing him. He found out that it was because at the same salary, the OPT worker would be cheaper due to Home Depot not having to pay SS and medicare tax to the OPT worker. 

This OPT program is a disgusting betrayal by our own government! Where can qualified U.S. entry level workers go? Can this OPT program be opened to U.S. citizens too? Citizens do not have the choice to offer themselves up without costing the SS and medicare tax discount. Only OPT foreign workers. How unfair is that!
