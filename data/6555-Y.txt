I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because it is beneficial for both F-1 students and the companies in which they did their OPT.

In the case where the students want to extend their OPT, their goal aligns with that of the company: to create value for the companies for which they are working. The student might be working on a project in progress, OPT would allow them to complete the project, and get the full experience of working as an employee, which is the purpose of OPT in the first place. This save the company's temporal and financial resources to look for someone else to complete the project, and leaves time for a transition into the next phase of the project. Thus OPT extension is beneficial for both the students and the company.
