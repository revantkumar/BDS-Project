I SUPPORT this proposal:

1. Thousands of foreign students may be forced to leave US if it does not pass. These foreign students are exceptional and can not be replaced.

2. If USA forced them to go back to their countries, these countries will become powerful competitors for USA in STEM areas and business.

3. Letting these people go home, USA may loose more development opportunities GLOBALLY. 

Although these students may compete with US citizen for job opportunities in States, however, if they go back, their countries would compete with USA for global opportunities, which might be even worse. 

4. Letting these smart people stay in USA will help US citizens stay more competitive, which is good for USA.
