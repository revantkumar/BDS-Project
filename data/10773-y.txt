Anne Broder I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 
This program creates an incentive for US tech companies to hire foreign students over qualified American while allowing foreign students to negate
their pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degrees.

It's hard enough for American workers, especially recent US graduates, to find work, This rule would make it even more difficult by adding
unnecessary job competition to the mix. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against them.
