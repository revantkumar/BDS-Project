The effort to provide this support to foreign students is a great disservice yet again to the American children and families who invested in higher education here in the US with the hopes of obtaining meaningful employment in their home country. By supporting foreign students more than our own, you the government are betraying you tax paying citizenry yet again, while rewarding a corrupt and morally bankrupt corporate America from paying their share of the taxes to support the bloated government that wastefully spends, from the POTUS on down. Have you thought about your own children or grand children after you've left your government posts? How will they pay their bills, by being slaves to foreign masters on their own country's soil?
