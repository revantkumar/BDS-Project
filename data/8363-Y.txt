I support the proposal, especially due to the current tight policy on acquiring U.S. working visas for new international graduates. Competition in job positions do not weaken U.S. citizens' advantages much since a lot of positions from smaller firms tend to avoid dealing with H1B visa problems, while the current U.S. job market still demands more technological experts that can be fulfilled by encouraging international students to stay in the U.S. through employment. The increasing number of overall STEM graduates also contributes to the advancement of science and technology in the U.S. in the long run.
