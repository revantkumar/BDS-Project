I SUPPORT the proposal for the reasons as followed:

1.More time with OPT is crucial for international students to really master what has been taught in the classes, lectures or programs, especially for STEM students, whose knowledge accumulated from classes would most likely have a huge gap from what's really going on in the industry. Extending OPT gives more time for graduated students to gain the experience for his focused area is good for the clarification of one's own goal and how to make progress, which matches the idea of US education has proposed.

2.More time for OPT also means more chance of diversity in an organization, which has been brought up so many times as a fact for the prosperity of such organization. If OPT were extended, international students would have less pressure or worries from the restriction of time they have been offered, and thus create more suitable environment for them to become more creative and innovative for the organization they are working with, which eventually with bring more good than harm to the industry.

3.The extension is not that long to harm anything. As previously settled, a STEM student would have another 17-month OPT after the initial 12-month OPT expires. The proposal right now is only asking it to be extended from 17 to 24, so that in most cases, it is just used for covering the gap period if a valued employee is transferred from f1 to h1b. I doesn't change the fact that there is only one lottery for each year and about 80000 people to be selected to have their visa status changed. So having a bit more time for OPT is giving graduated international student more time to make use for their own studies as well as the contribution to the organizations they belong to. In my opinion, I would call it mutual benefit.
