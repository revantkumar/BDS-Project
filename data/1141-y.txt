Ali Assadian I highly support any policy which would help foreign students, who are an asset to both this country and their home country, have the opportunity to work for extended time in USA in order to be exposed to working ethics and techniques here. A better understanding of the business environment of America is not something that can be learned rather be it should be experienced. And thus, the people who have been smart enough to make it to the USA's academic environment should have a better and longer chance of being exposed to the business environment in America.
