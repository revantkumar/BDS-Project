Davy Lee America is known to be a great country that holds the most brilliant people all over the world. However, things are changing these year as length of OPT is in danger. Actually American government and companies have already protected American students so much. When students try to find internship, foreign students are so inferior compared with others, not due to their academic abilities, just because they are visa holder. In career fair, less 10 percent of companies accept the application from visa holder, and they still consider American citizens first. It makes sense, but if America wants to stay robust, it must provide opportunities for those elites who are willing to make contribution to the development of America. STEM degrees need real efforts and intelligence. We can't deny the fact that students from China,India or some other foreign counties are better in many of STEM majors. 

OPT is extremely critical to F-1 students. They need time to be familiar with the competitions and find a job that they truly love. Also they need to draw for the work visa which is such a inequitable policy. Longer OPT means that they can have one or two extra chance to draw, so that real elites can keep working in America, and it decrease the degree of injustice.

Oh, one last thing is that immigrants are not threats unless you are really weak. Most of the immigrants are hard working and well behaved. You hate those nice immigrants because you are a coward. You are afraid of the potential that they take your position. But they have large competitive disadvantage in language and racial. If you can't beat them in such advantages, you probably do not deserve the spot you want.
