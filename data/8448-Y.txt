I strongly support this F1 STEM extension policy. America is an immigrating country. The reason why America is most powerful country in the world is NOT because people in America are smart. It is because America can attract talented youngsters around the world to learn here. OPT extension doesn't necessary influence work opportunities of American. Only a few students after OPT will stay here for a longer time. More people will get back to their own countries to work. OPT extension will surely attract more international students to study here, which is pretty good for America's economics.
