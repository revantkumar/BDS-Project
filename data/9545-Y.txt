M. Andrea Popa Please see our full letter attached.

Boston University strongly supports the proposed rule to extend Optional Practical Training for graduates in STEM fields. The new rule strikes an effective balance between allowing for mentored training for U.S. students in highly skilled fields and creating opportunities for U.S. employers to benefit from U.S. trained workers without being subject to the severe caps currently in place for the H-1B program.

We are particularly encouraged by the following provisions in the new proposed rule that are favorable to U.S. international students and benefit U.S. employers as well:

1)Extending eligibility for STEM OPT from 17-months to 24-months
2)Allowing for a second period of STEM OPT after a subsequent degree in a STEM field
3)Expansion of CIP programs codes for STEM OPT eligibility
4)Extension of the authorized period of unemployment for the STEM OPT extension to 150 days
5)Clarification on cap-gap eligibility for all F-1 students
6)Restricting the STEM OPT benefit to degrees earned at accredited U.S. universities

These provisions strengthen the integrity of the STEM program and expand opportunities for meaningful training in high-skilled fields.
