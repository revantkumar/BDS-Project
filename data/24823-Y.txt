I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. One of the perfect spirit in U.S's culture is to give everyone equal chance.Talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. We should give them more time to let them contribute more to the U.S industry.
2.It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
3. If the U.S's IT and relative industry has a significant development, more and more local people could also find proper job in these area. This is a two-side winner situation.
