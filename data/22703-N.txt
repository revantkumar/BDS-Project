Although I graduated from college a long time ago and am at retirement age, I do sympathize with American college graduates who have to deal with unfair foreign competition for scarce jobs and with an influx of foreign workers who drive down wages in the US. The US Government spends too much time advocating for foreign workers and not enough for American college graduates, who should be favored for the training opportunities in private sector companies. There should be quotas imposed on the foreign students after eligible American-born college graduates are considered for available openings first. News reports on cable are illustrating that American workers in general are fairing very poorly because of the Obama administration's immigration policies and lag behind foreign born workers in earnings, wage growth, etc. This has got to stop. All that needs to be done is to give preference to American born workers for the best jobs, training, etc. Then, consideration should be given to foreign born workers.
