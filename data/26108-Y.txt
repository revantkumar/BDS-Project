There are at least 3 benefits of improving and expanding the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.

To begin with, it helps companies to keep the talents from F-1 nonimmigrant background, and maintain diversity and inclusion, which will boost the creativity, improve problem solving process and help the companies to make better decisions. For example, I work in the technology department of an international bank, the management team speaks highly of the importance of diversity. With a diverse pool of employees, managers tend to have more thorough process of thinking, soliciting opinions and making decisions. Also, the diversity gives birth to inspiration and innovation, which are critical to technology companies.

Moreover, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees have great potential of starting new companies and creating new jobs for U.S. For instance, now is the era of big data, and there are lots of opportunities in that area. Those F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees are among those who are capable of applying the analytical and quantitative techniques and seizing the opportunities. Their diverse backgrounds are their advantages to be creative. If we can keep the talents longer, they will have more time to fulfill their entrepreneurship and create more jobs for the society.

Last but not least, it helps companies to keep a lower turnover rate. It is a pain for the companies to lose their talents, for example due to the visa status. In that case, the companies have to struggle to look for new talents whose skill sets match and personalities fit with the team, which is time-consuming and not efficient. Raising the duration of OPT can remediate such worries and help reduce the turnover rate for the companies.
