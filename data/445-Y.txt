I strongly support the new stem extension rule. The reasons the other people used to against this rule is indefensible:

1. OPT DIDN'T TAKE JOBS AWAY FROM US CITIZENS. 
a) We got our jobs because we are more capable of them.
b) We are not cheap labors. I am pretty sure that most of OPT students earn way more than people who claiming
they are replaced by cheaper labor especially in fortune 500 companies.

2. Most students in OPT status are legal and working as a full time. DHS surely can find a way to oversee the status more rigorously to satisfy the skeptics.

3. United States are united states because of the immigrants. We hope we can stay and live here and become part of it. I just don't understand why people say we have no ties to US.

Again, I strongly support this rule. Please let it pass.

Thanks!
