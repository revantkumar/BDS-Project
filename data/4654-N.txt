Protect American Workers - DHS Accepting Public Comments Until Nov. 18
Rare and Real Opportunity to Stop Executive Action 

The Obama administration is preparing to make it easier for the technology industry to utilize cheap, foreign labor for science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs rather than hire American graduates. Under the proposed rule, the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will allow foreign STEM degree-holders to remain in the country and work on their
student visas for up to 3 years after they graduate. The proposed rule involves extending the Optional Practical Training
(OPT) programa DHS creation to keep foreign "students" in the countryfrom 12 months after graduation to 36 months 
for those in the STEM field. Outrageously, DHS is trying to extend the STEM OPT even after a federal judge struck down the 
2008 OPT extension for foreign STEM graduates from 12 months to 29 months. That case, WashTech v. DHS, which is still
going through the court system, was brought by the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI).
