To whom it matters,

the worker protections included in the new rule "are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way."

"Like other employment-visa programs, OPT works to lower the wages and living standards of a growing portion of the middle class."
"Although tech workers' wages have been flat for years and thousands of American STEM grads are out of work, tech executives and shareholders are rolling in money."
DHS "is neglecting its duty under federal guidance to discuss crucial economic considerations, such as how many OPT workers will be hired instead of American workers; how many STEM grads have given up finding work in the STEM field; how the new rule will affect tech-worker wages and American STEM-grad employment."
"Not only will this artificially expand the domestic labor pool by hundreds of thousands, but 100 percent of the new recruits will be young and therefore cheap, and almost guaranteed to neither unionize nor get poached from competitors (because their 'student' visas will be tied to their employers)."
"because these workers are still technically 'students,' they won't have to pay payroll taxes, saving the company around $10,000 for each of the three years they're in the program."

I believe you need to take in consideration the intent. You can never convince me that any program, at inception, was ment to advance one group at the exspense of another. As with any program there are problems with abuse and mis interpitaions. Hence the need to overhaul the rules. Still to harm one group in the advance for another could never be the intent. This program was to help those coming to this country get a solid foot hold, great! Now it's just another corporate welfare program. That's were the reform should start.
