This would be great news for US high tech industry and the future of the country. One important factor for US future growth is the development of high tech industry. Unfortunately, while the industrt has great demand in this IT age, we do not have enough talented/qualified candidates to fill the spots. Foreign students with adequate skills can thus become important resources at this moment

On the other hands, if we make these foreign students go back too early, they would help grow our global competitors using skills that they learn here. And we would still be surffering shortage of high tech engineers and scientists in the next five to ten years, leading to slower growth of high tech industry and eventually slower economy and less positions in the future.
