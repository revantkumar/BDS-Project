Judging by the amount of foreign students in statistics, math, computer science, informatics, and data science majors, stoping OPT extension is going to have a enormous negative effect on IT industries.There will be a huge shortage in employees, and there is not enough domestic students who can fill those jobs. I will not be surprised if companies start to lose money because of the fact that not enough people's doing the job.
