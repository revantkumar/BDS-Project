Naseer Thurkintavida I strongly support this Rule and believe that this will help remove barriers that prevent some students from studying in the U.S. or remaining here after they finish their degrees, the U.S. is missing out on enormous benefits.

The stats show that there are 3 new jobs crated for every seven international student enrolled (Ref: http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/eis2014/USA.pdf)

In House Speaker John Boehner's Ohio district alone, 1,528 international students contributed over $56 million to the local economy and supported 837 jobs. And in Sen. Jeff Sessions' home state of Alabama, 7,451 international students contributed around $183 million to the economy and supported 2,064 jobs. Furthermore, international students are particularly important to the U.S. metropolitan areas in which they live and study. Many foreign students come from fast-growing cities in emerging markets and international students can serve as bridges between their home cities and the U.S. cities where they come to study. 

Data from both the IIE and NAFSA reports confirm that the United States, which hosts more of the world's 4.5 million globally mobile college and university students than any other country, remains a destination of choice for higher educationfor now. Due to increased competition from other countries, the U.S. lost nearly 10 percent of its market share of international students in 10 years, declining from 28 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2011.

If Congress doesn't take action, we will lose talented international students. The billions of dollars they contribute to this nation, along with the invaluable academic and cultural contributions they bring, will be at risk.
