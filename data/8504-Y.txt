Grace McCormick I strongly support this STEM OPT policy

STEM international students are disadvantaged and NOT favored on the job market in the U.S. And YES, this is TRUE. When an American STEM student and a STEM international student are the SAME qualified for the same position, guess who will ALWAYS get preferred to the other? THE AMERICAN student. Its because international students dont speak as good English, have less connections in this country, will enjoy the same salary package and NEED SPONSORSHIP which costs the company money!! This makes sense and is fair because they are not citizens. The ONLY situation where employers will still hire them is that international STEM students are MORE QUALIFIED.
