I strongly AGREE this policy!!!
I was deeply shocked by these American who complained they can`t find jobs just because of our STEM students. Most of foreigners are working hard and learning hard than the American, the mainly reason you cannot find jobs is your low ability and low grades, not the foreigners!! I think DHS should issue this policy because the American have enjoyed lots of benefits from the government, they are pretty easy to find jobs than foreigners, that causes more and more American students not study and get very low grades in school! But they still complain about they have less opportunities to get jobs. I think the STEM students can bring competitive power and promote the economic growing faster, maybe some American students would be more lazy if the STEM extension is canceled.
