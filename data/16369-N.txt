We have plenty of legal and native citizens that can do these jobs. Stop selling out our own people that we have helped educate partially through our taxes. A country is supposed to take care of our own citizens first, then help where we can for others while being fiscally responsible. This administration may say it looks out for the middle class or the poor, but in fact does the opposite and this rule exemplifies it to the max. Have you no shame? Do you not care for regular citizens and your young generation?
