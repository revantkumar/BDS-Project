It is so obvious the extension of OPT will definitely benifit US finance a lot. First of all, those high talented and well educated people contribute a lot for the work they are doing, I personally believe it will be a disaster for Silicon Valley if OPT not extend, it's not only those students will suffer, but also the companies and business will facing a gigantic loss of great workers, so did their finance. 

Second, those who are saying STEM students taking more opportunities for jobs it is really a shame, those who are not willing for students to have an extension, they are just fear of competition. It is such a world of fair competition, eliminate people out instead of prepare yourself is a very stupid way. Because technology will not improve since there are less competition and that will provide some position for thosewell paid but less qualified people. 

Third, those people against immigration,OPT extension it is really not a problem. Students just want to get this training opportunity instead of being perms ant resident in US. Other regulations should be think about for no immigration rather than stop OPT extension. Students will suffer instead of those people who are going to immigrate will suffer. So we need to think that really carefully, the regulations should affect on those who are going to immigrate rather than depress students the opportunity to practice!
