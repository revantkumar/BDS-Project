The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.

If nothing else, this proposed regulation is representative of the insanity that is US immigration policy that only serves the wealthy, the politically connected, and immigrants while expecting poor and middle class US citizens to just shut up and take the abuse. It's no wonder our government is so widely disliked and untrusted by its citizens; it keeps on proposing regulations and laws like OPT and TPP.
