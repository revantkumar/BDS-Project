Strongly Support. If the OPT extension is cancelled, the US institution will lose its globally competence and see a huge lost of international students. The other industries will suffer significantly from this decision. It could be a win-win situation. It would be a very short sight decision for canneling the extension.

Hey, the Opponent! You are scaring of losing your jobs because you are not working hard and studying hard as us international students and you don't want to admit it. I don't think we are taking the job opportunities that you should have. Because even without us, the great job are never gonna be yours if you don't fight for it. And you know what, if the rich international kid are no longer paying the high institution fee, not buying Luxury most of US college students can never afford, not spending and boost your economy while we studying her. If we abandon US and go to a country for a better board studying experience, I tell you what, your parents probably are probably gonna be laid off because no one is buying. 

And don't forget, your grandparents or the parents of your grandparents were all immigrants and they were welcome by this country. That's what make US a great country. The opponent of OPT extension are just too lazy to work hard and scare of some proper competition. If US want to let this lazy people take charge, a great falling of the country is not far away.
