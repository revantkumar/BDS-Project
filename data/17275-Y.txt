I strongly support this rule. 
1.Owing to the spirit that everyone has equal opportunities, the U.S.A has attacted many talented people who might be keys to so many amazing achievements in America. Those talented people would like to devote their best parts to America in return for equal opportunities that they could not enjoy in their motherland. 
2.By giving opportunities for hard-working international students, industries could achieve more interests and provide more job opportunities for all people. In turn, more international students choose to devote their best parts in exchange for praticing themsevles in this most democratic country. That is a positive feedback, which ruling out those active international students could not bring. 
3.I am an undergraduate student who is planning to apply for graduate program in America. I love my motherland, but I still would like to devote my whole passion to training opportunites in American. Because the U.S.A might be the only place in the world that could provide us equal opportunity which is our desperate need.
