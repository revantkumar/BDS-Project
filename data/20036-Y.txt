Employing F-1 visa holders will only suppress wages of US engineers. We don't need them, and there is precious little good can come out of mass employment of these "students". Instead, we should be paying higher wages to engineers and that would increase the domestic talent pool not by importing students. We can immediately start this by reducing the number of F-1 visas given out yearly. Yes, a few professors in some 2nd rate schools would have to find real jobs for themselves, but this way they can also help to alleviate the so-called "shortage" in STEM.
