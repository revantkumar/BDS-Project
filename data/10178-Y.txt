I am an owner of two houses around UCDavis. My main incoming comes from the International students' rent payment. If OPT is shortened, there must be incredible decreasing number of international studengts coming to UCDavis for high level of education. Therefore, it will not just affect my incoming, but my whole family. I believe I am not the single person earning money from International students. I belive their more and more coming will increase more job opportunities and help a lot of USA citizens like me to live a better life with more money!
