I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out. International students have nearly nothing to do with the minimum wage or illegal immigration. Almost all international students obtain their OPT in order to get an H1B visa, which requires the worker to meet a minimum salary standard that is far higher than the minimum wage level.
