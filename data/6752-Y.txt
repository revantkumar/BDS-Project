Gina Ellison As a NAFSA member, I fully support the comments made by NAFSA on this draft policy. 

I have the additional comments. 

The DSO should only be responsible for collecting and maintaining the Mentoring and Training Plan, not reviewing and/or approving it.

SEVP should be responsible for educating employers and reminding students of various responsibilities and deadlines.

SEVP should allow schools access to the students SEVIS record at a previous school if we are supposed to verify a STEM degree awarded by a previous school and used to qualify for a STEM extension.
