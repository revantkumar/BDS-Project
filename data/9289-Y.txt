I am graduate student in software engineering. As I can see the demand for software developer continue increasing since software now become a vehicle that promote business, create new service that brings prosperity to people. OPT extention is definitely benificial to those company that seeking software devlopers to promote their business since they can not only find talent people with programming skills, but most importantly find the one that fit their job position. By and large, I don't think OPT extention will harm American people but to the opposite it will promote the whole society.
