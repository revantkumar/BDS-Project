Yu Zhang I strongly support this proposal for the following reason.

Diversity is a main reason United States built its strength on. Ever since the foundation of America, the friendly welcoming immigration regulations attracted thoudsands of talents who contributed in everyway and keep America moving forward and always stay in a leading position. 

Students who have made their way to American pursuing a degree are usually among the top talents of their peers. The application process of American Universities are known to be regorious. Only the best ones can get out of their way to prepare for these admission and made it successfully here. Offering the opportunities to contribute after gradutation is the most important and direct way to exploit these young talents to build this country. If the regulations are not welcoming, these students would have used what they leant here to build other countries, or even worse, America would have lost its attractiveness to the most talented people in the world. 

There are a lot of successful people who are immigranted students or descendants of immigranted students. Elon musk, who built the most creative technical companies, Suan Wojcicik, who is CEO of Youtube and her father is an immigranted student from poland and later became Stanford professor. Just to name a few. In fact, every one here in America can be traced back to some immigrants who left their own country and came to this land for a dream. Among them, many are students. 

Diversity is America's post powerful element, we should keep it and make even better regulations to attract more talented students.
