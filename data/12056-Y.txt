I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. U.S. companies should keep qualified employees and hire graduates on a merit basis regardless of their nationality, and it is also a great way to keep diversity.

2. Competitions do exist, but is not a bad thing. American people who complain that their kids cannot find a job may have ignored the fact that their kids are not hard-working and competitive enough and do not deserve high-pay jobs. And American employees within a company can learn from foreigners and enhance their skills as well.

3. American's science and economy development cannot live without the contribution of aliens since the U.S. is an immigration country.
