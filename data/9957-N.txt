Americans should be priority for tech jobs or any jobs. Lets not allow the undercutting of wages or people from other countries that are not more qualified for jobs to get those jobs. We have too many unemployed to be allowing our jobs to be given away to others. The only time we should be giving jobs to a foreigner is if we can't find an American to do the job.
