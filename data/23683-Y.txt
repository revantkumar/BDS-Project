I'm a master student of computer science. I work for a top tier CAM/CAD/CAE company after graduation. I believe my talent can contribute a lot to the company's success. But without the STEM rule, I'm very likely to go back home when I work for 1 year and just got enough experience to make value for the company. That's a great loss for both the company and myself as well as the US economy. Please don't force talented people leaving this country when they are ready to make contribution.
