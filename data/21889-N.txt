Congress has been voted the governing body by the American people to oversee all rules and regulations proposed by the government. It is not acceptible to extend the OPT without consulting Congress. This is a bad suggestion that will deprive our students at the cost of gifting foreign students with more time in the country and with good jobs. The status of Social Security is also negatively affected by this proposed rule. As we know, Social Security is already in serious trouble of existence.
