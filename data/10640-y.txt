Kim Wice Again, our own government is showing that they are against their own people, true Americans. Many of know that
you have an agenda, but I can tell you that someday, it will backfire. You think these foreigners that you let in,
will work for lower wages and do whatever they are told. Many are from countries that have brainwashed them
that they can never makes waves, that they will always do as their told and that the government always takes
care of them. You will be very surprised when they too start to realize that there is freedom here that they don't
have in their own countries and they just might bring you down, socially, economically and morally.

The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentives employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
