Parth Damle The extension of OPT to 24 months for STEM programs would help me work in the U.S. for three years without an H1-B visa. The firm for which I will work would benefit from me greatly when I would have ramped up the learning curve for my job. Typically, a period of one year is required to learn each and every aspect of one's job. U.S. firms would benefit more from my work after the first year. Hence, it is a win - win situation for both the parties - the firm and me, if the rule is implemented.
