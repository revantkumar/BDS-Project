The extension will benefit both hardworking international students and the US country. 

The US currently welcomes the international students to pursue higher education in the country, I believe the goal is not just let them go back their own country and contribute to their homeland with what they learn in the US. Rather, US should attract persons with abilities, either native or foreign, so as to help the development if the US. The extension will definitely be one of the most appealing regulations for the international students with abilities.

For international students, the extension allow them to be comfortable in the US, so that they can worry about something that really matters, instead of worrying about their identities, VISAs... Especially for PhD students, who usually spend more than 5 years in the US. Many of them would like to stay since this is where they can continue cutting-edge research.

In short, if the US is a country that respect efforts and would like to become better, the extension is a good beginning.
