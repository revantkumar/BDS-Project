It is important to have F1 OPT extension for both the United States' economy and sustainable development for the STEM industry. The United States has devoted funding, infrastructure as well as manpower to help international students learn STEM subjects across thousands of universities and colleges. It is foolish to drive those students away once they graduate. They could benefit United States by providing their intelligence and passion in the STEM fields.

Some anti-immigration groups claim that international students would 'steal' jobs from US citizens, which represents a naive thought. Those talented US students, chose NOT to go to STEM field, but rather prefer financial institutes at Wall street, where the pay and benefits are far better than in the STEM field.

Besides, don't forget that U.S. is founded by immigrants. It would be a disrespect for ancestors and founding principles if we turn down new well-educated immigrants. 

We need OPT STEM extension for a better United States in the technology sector.
