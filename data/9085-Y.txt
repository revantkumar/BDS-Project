Increase the cap gap for students applying for H1-B

Currently 65,000 visas are granted every year and an additional 20,000 are given to F1 students. We must have more visas for the F1 students because these are students who have come to this country and obtained an education which is among the best in the world. The 65,000 people who come are being sponsored by a company which is simply trying to save money. Their level of education is not even remotely comparable to the education obtained in the United States. We must prioritize granting visas to students who have a much higher skill set than the average H1 worker who is simply here by virtue of working for some firm without even having the right educational qualifications.
