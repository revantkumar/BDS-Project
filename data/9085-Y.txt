Calvin Sun, The Sun Law Firm LLC Current language regarding cap-gap extension reads:
"(vi) Extension of duration of status and grant of employment authorization. (A) The duration of status, and any employment authorization granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) or (C), of an F-1 student who is the beneficiary of an H-1B petition and request for change of status shall be automatically extended until October 1 of the fiscal year for which such H-1B visa is being requested where such petition:"

I respectfully request and suggest that instead of extending automatically until "October 1," duration of status and employment authorization rather be extended "until adjudication of such H-1B petition is complete."

An October 1 extension might have been appropriate in earlier times, when petitions were adjudicated well before October 1. However, workload issues and RFE responses can delay such adjudications beyond October 1. The result of this situation is a beneficiary who must stop working on October 1 and wait for a decision. 

By changing the end date of authorization from October 1 to adjudication complete, such a beneficiary could avoid such a gap. Thank you.
