I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities in the country and let them keep making contributions to the country.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. A lot of top talents in US are international students who should be given equal opportunity for finding a job.

3. The proposal could also increase the number of potential applicants for studying in US universities.
