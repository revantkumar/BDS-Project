That's really an appreciative effort by DHS. In my opinion it would benefit both sides. We can see wider opportunities coming up and the young being interested in entrepreneurship are laying quite good foundation for the up soaring technology. These kind of initiatives are taking United States higher and they aid in its financial growth. Not to forget the huge taxes earned by the govt. Revoking the extension may surely cause lack of man power which will directly affect the production and market. In such scenario there wouldn't be enough time to rebuild and gain back control. And finally a big thank you United States
