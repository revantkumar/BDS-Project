I strongly support this rule for the following two reasons: 1. It's good for US economy. Economy growth of US relies heavily on the contributions from foreign talents. Most of students who need OPT extension are those equipped well with knowledge and skills in STEM areas. We should admit that these students do contribute a lot to US, for examples, those engineers in IT companies. 2. It helps US to build a good image in the world. US is a country mostly consisting of immigrants all over the world and equality is the spirit we always advocate. We should give equal opportunity to each talent no matter their citizenship.
