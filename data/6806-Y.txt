I support the extension of OPT. Imagine that the U.S. government spend a huge amount of money for many international students to get there degree, because many of them get contracts as Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant. They get payment and have their tuition covered, which is actually the money from the government. After we spend so much money and resource for their education, then we let them go back to their countries. It is totally loss for our resource and education.
