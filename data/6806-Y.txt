Jason Chen I strongly support the OPT EXTENSION. Because actually the OPT extension is only for STEM students, and these students will look for the technology jobs, and this area needs lots of lots of employees every year, and actually even foreign students want to work in US, lots of companies still can't find qualified employees. I see lots of comments say that foreign students will compete with Americans and make them lose jobs, actually I think this is not true. Because as I wrote, STEM students could only look for jobs related to their majors, which are technology related position. And actually the number of American students in this field may be not enough for the demand of this kind of job position. In addition, if we don't hire foreign students to work in technology positions, the US will lose talents and this will have a bad influence on the industry, especially the IT industry. As a result, the whole economy of US will be influenced a lot. So if we give the foreign talented students the OPT extension, we will attract them to make contribution to US, and this will be a great thing to US economy and US development.
