The proposed rule from the Dept. of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment
to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign
students who have been pursuing a degree, in the U.S. for at least 9 months, artificially expanding the pool of workers for jobs in
science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. This would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers.
The program actually offers incentives to employers who hire foreign students, because they don't have to pay the employer 
portion of payroll taxes, or a prevailing wage. This practice costs Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds $4 billion. The
OPT program is an easy way for companies to hire cheap labor, at the expense of U.S. citizens. Immigration policy should
serve in the interests of American workers, not against them.
