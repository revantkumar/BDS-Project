I sort of understand the frustration of those who are against this rule. However, the actual threat to them is not foreign students staying a bit longer to get in-work training, but those foreign labors directly apply for H1B visa from overseas. The later consists of the majority of beneficiary of H1B visa petitions, like 300,000 of them each year. Why no one points out this obvious loophole in US immigration system is beyond me.
