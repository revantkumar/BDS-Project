STEM OPT extension has been a significant reason why top notch international students decides to attend an University in the US instead of others developed countries.
It plays an important role ensuring the competitiveness of US higher education globally.

Moreover, STEM OPT extension does not necessarily mean more permanent jobs being taken as eventually most of the foreign students would move back to their home country and compared to a few months of work experience only, working in the States for more than one year could be a much stronger selling point of the students.
