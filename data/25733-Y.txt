I've read some comments opposite to this proposal. I have to say it's really fun. Most of them keep emphasis that NO IMMIGRATION!! The problem is what's the relationship with the immigration and the OPT? Have they really done any investigation into this? Please do not make these useless comments. 

America is a great country, leading the world in many aspects like economy, science, education and etc. However, will all of these take the place of the family? Will F1 students give up their family, their people, their friends since they were a child, for such a even non-existing opportunity? OK, you may say, they can get their parents green card too. May I ask, will your parents give up what they've been fighting in their whole lives just for migrating to a foreign country - no friends, no career, even cannot communicate with people because they don't know English!!!!
