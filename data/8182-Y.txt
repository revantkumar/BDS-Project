I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Without enough time to pursue opportunities for training after graduation, students from other countries would not be attracted to educational institutions in United States as now. Other countries would have better policies imposed on training for STEM students after their graduation so that the educational institutions in U.S. would be hurt by the loss of potential students and talents.

2. STEM students' training would not affect the job opportunities for U.S. citizens in that only small number of companies sponsor international students, and the companies that employ international students actually do NOT pay lower salary to international students. That is to say, no priority is given to these international students by the employers.

3. STEM students from other countries have been making contributions to United States in the past years during their training while they are gaining their experience. We can NOT ignore their contributions and efforts to the society.
