Jerry McClanahan I firmly believe that keep international STEM students with an extension of 24 months is necessary.
t is vital for our domestic Hi-Tech industry. Many of the employee in my business is from China and India, providing their unique intelligence and talent. IT companies share the same situation as i do. If the OPT extension is curtail to 12 months for the students, leaving U.S. will be reasonable. Tens of thousands of talents our college educated will flow back to their original country leaving no value for our country. This is definitely not the intend of the OPT policies.
Based on all these reasons, i strongly support extend the OPT to 24 months for the international STEM students!
