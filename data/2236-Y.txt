As a COO of a high-tech company in Michigan, I strongly support the new opt stem extension. Our company do need the international young talents to help us develop new products and techs for optical communication. We prefer to hire U.S. citizen, but few we can found has expertise in our area. Therefore, the opt stem extension is must for our company to keep those international young talents working for us and maintain the annual growth/profits of our company. Also, more H-1B are necessary!
