We should never be short-sighted when looking at immigration issues. The core interests of this country, as well as its competency comes from the fact that many extremely talented people would love to come here, and contribute.
So how would you define 'talents'? It is not too hard to realize that the average education level, diligence, and expertise of F1 students are beyond an average American. And among these students there are those outstanding ones that are born to be people of great impact, the leaders of the future.
Many have talked about those students taking up jobs of Americans. Well I have to point out that mercilessly that ordinary Americans are not capable of what they are doing so essentially you are not in the same job market. Even if these students are not allowed to work, you simply won't get the job anyway because you don't qualify, likely because of lack of education and diligence.
Yes we can absolutely ban anyone from coming to this country, and forbid anyone to immigrate. But we'd better realize that we are sitting inside a sinking ship. We either invite the talents to our home, or watch they work for our competitors against our interests.
