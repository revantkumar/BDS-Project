I am a international graduate student majoring in Computer Engineering in Texas A&M University. I am the steady supporter towards improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.

Information technology industry, particularly Internet industry, is very hot in US. Not only big Internet Companies, for instance FLAG(Facebook, LinkedIn, Amazon, Google), but also startup companies in Information Technology recruit lots of entry-level employees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering every year. However, the number of Americans with the required background and skills sets is way less than the numerous number of recruiting demands. In the graduate computer science classes, I can hardly find American student. Most of my classmates are international students. If optional training practice is not expanded, which is only 12 months long, there will be immediately two thirds loss of employees in information technology industry, which will turn into a completely disaster towards IT industry, which is the heavy price that United States cannot afford. Besides, the well educated people, including our international students who receive advanced education in US, are the backbone of the United State's future. US government should spare no effort to keep those people stay in US rather than retraining them with working visa.

In summary, it is win-win that improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.
