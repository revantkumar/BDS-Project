I believe the OPT extension is not in the interest of American students who graduate. Americans who complete the challenge of college need to have employment on the horizon, and businesses have the lure of hiring foreign students "temporarily" for a lower wage, and not pay social security for the foreign worker, thereby denying the social security program funds.
I also believe that hiring foreign graduates opens the door for a security weakness. These students have a loyalty to their home country, and despite being vetted or separated from classified projects and information, they are still exposed to it and can collect a wide scope of information about the STEM business, its projects, and its workers. In the interest of security, these foreign graduates should not be hired on.
