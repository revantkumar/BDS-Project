I am an international student and I totally support the policy. Of course extending opt is of our interest, but it is also doing good to the United states. The more talents working in US, the better economy or development American people can have. Some Americans may worry about the more intense job opportunities. However, I believe people should get what they pay. Especially in knowledge industry, people with real talent can always get a job.
