Samantha Sharp International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM. This suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
