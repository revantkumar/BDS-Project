Linus Z Dear Barbara Larson,

As a matter of fact, many companies don't sponsor international students because immigration lawyer or people with such expertise are required to file the sponsorship for the students. But the pool of well-trained American students is too small to accommodate the rapid expansion of high-tech companies and their growing need for high-tech workers. Meanwhile, the US educational system attracted lots of top international students to the country to pursue knowledge and training in STEM. It is a win-win situation for the US economy and international students to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. Highly skilled persons educated in the United States contribute significantly to the U.S. economy, including advances in entrepreneurial and research and development endeavors, which correlate highly with overall economic growth and job creation. 

Sincerely,

Linus S.
