I strongly support the proposal to extend OPT extension period for STEM students. 

A lot of the PhD level STEM students go through postdoctoral trainings in academic institutions before they moved on to find positions in industry. Such postdoctoral trainings allow them to further develop their abilities in many aspects they very often don't practice a lot during their PhD trainings, such as collaboration with other scientists and turn scientific ideas into meaningful scientific discoveries. Such postdoctoral training often takes more than 2 years. By extending the OPT extension period for the STEM students, it would give them more freedom in choosing their employers after postdoctoral trainings as they can extend their OPT instead of rushing into finding jobs that sponsor working authorization.

It is for the scientific and technological industries' benefit that the skilled, well-trained STEM students remain in the US after their graduation. US has been on the lead position for its innovation and revolution of individual industries varying from the high tech to the disease treatment. To keep its leading position ahead of other countries, it is vital to keep this seemingly enormous, but actually very scarce source of human power. 

The highly skilled STEM students will be the ones who in the end help the economy grow and create more jobs opportunities for the others, who compose the majority of the population of the US.
