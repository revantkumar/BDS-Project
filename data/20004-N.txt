Under the current Obama administration we have lost the respect of other nations. We have opened our borders to illegal immigrants who are using up our national resources, and cost each and every American thousands of dollars to feed, house, educate and provide healthcare for. Then to top it off the Obama administration wants to bring hundreds of thousands more refugees here to take more of our jobs and provides welfare for. And to ice the cake give even more high tech jobs to foreign workers. He is the worst president ever. I hope you do not let him pass one more law to give away anything else that is for Americans, I am voting for Trump who will put Americans FIRST! Thank God Trump is running and I pray he wins. I shouldn't even have to write a letter asking for our jobs to be saved for our citizens!
