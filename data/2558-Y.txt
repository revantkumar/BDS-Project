I think this will be a really good policy, especially for our international students. I've seen many of my friends leaving the job they liked just because of the limited OPT time. And some just searching for jobs that are less satisfying but provide work visas, rather than the jobs they are more suitable and like. It seems to me big loses to both the companies and the persons themselves. This expansion of traning time could enable students have more time to know what they are really good at, and thus choose a career that they can devote to. It will also provide the companies, especially those high tech companies, with more loyal employees.
