I strongly support this new STEM OPT rule due to two main reasons.

First of all, the previous 17 months opt plays a key role in attracting foreign talents to the States and brings huge growth to the US education sector. With out a new Stem rule, many foreign students may no longer consider US universities as their priorities as only 12-month regular OPT is certainly not enough for gaining necessary industry experience in STEM fields. Normally, STEM programs last for more than 2 years.

Then, STEM students often serve as a bridge between cutting-edge academic improvements and industry applications. The new STEM rule would allow students bring newest knowledge from school to industry practice during their internship/employment based on it. During the past several years, many US industries, especially the High Tech and Financial, have benefited from the old 17-month rule. The huge growth of industry giants, like Google, Microsoft and Amazon, is largely support by the innovation brought from academic fields.

Thus, the new STEM OPT rule, from my point of view, will be very necessary to US overall.
