The fast development of web services outside the US is reminding us how fast the Internet based industries are evolving. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, started five years after Amazon, becomes the largest e-commerce company in the world. Without the software engineers building and expending the B2B e-commerce website from scratch, the sales achieved by Alibaba would be unimaginable. 
Alibaba is just one of the many examples how newly born foreign business can leverage technologies to gain an upper hand over US companies. To keep American tech companies competitive, continuous leverage of technologies is a must. The good news is that with the solid finance foundation of large cooperation and the abundant angel investor opportunities, US companies, big or small, are much easier to gain access to the best technologies available than the rest of the world. However, to fully take the advantage of these technologies we also need to have the talents who know how to work with these technologies. Hiring experts and experienced workers is always the best choice to maximize the return on these technologies, but the tech companies requires an unprecedented growth rate in order to stay competitive in the global market, and these companies need to acquire talents through all means to keep this growth rate. STEM students, who have specialized in science and technology in colleges or even graduate schools, are ideal to aid this course. Google, Facebook and Salesforce are just a few examples of how fast tech companies expand today, and these companies would not achieve their speed of expansion if STEM students are not able to make their contribution. The training opportunity provided in this proposal opens new talent sources for the fast-moving tech companies in the US helping US tech companies to grow faster and to be more competitive in the global market.
