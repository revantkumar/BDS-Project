I approve the STEM OPT proposal. I think this is the basic spirit of united states. 
Every student from university has equal rights to get a job in the land of America. Man born equal, why the international student may be rejected by a perfect suitable job while American students not. I don't think this proposal make international students above american students, the proposal gives everyone a right to earn their job and pay tax to the government by their intelligence and diligence instead of the birthplace. Many international students have shown their brilliant talents in US, from economics to IT, from CEOs to workers. Everyone serves this country with their great passion. In this prospect, international students are part of US citizens, so please be kind to all the US citizens.
