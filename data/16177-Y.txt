As a potential student in China, I would be greatly disappointed if US cut off international students' OPT extension. Students in STEM all know that their participation in any tech company's project should be at least two years to really gain experience if they wanna go back to their own country's job market. So I strongly SUPPORT OPT extension! I will reconsider study in US since I cannot gain any powerful working experience if I cannot work legally there for two years.
