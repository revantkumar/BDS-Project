Andrew Li U.S. STEM programs graduate tens of thousands of students every year. Most of those students, especially in the Master's and doctoral levels are international students. These people are the engines for advancing science and technology in the human society. Goolge, a representative of high-tech STEM corporations, employs a large amount of foreign engineers and scientists in its R&D centers.

If U.S. does not keep those talented people with effective policies, U.S. will lose them to other competing countries. U.S. will gradually lose its edge in science and technology, which will eventually hinder the economic growth.

The 24 month STEM OPT program allows U.S. to identify and keep valuable talents within U.S. and maintain its technology advantage. 

On the other side, many high-tech businesses in U.S. have hired a lot of STEM students who need H1B visas. Due to the H1B cap, many employees do not receive the H1B visas during the first year of employment. The 24 month STEM program will alleviate the issue and save money and time for those companies.

In summary, this rule is strongly recommended for approval.
