I support the new STEM OPT extension rule. There are 2 foreign statistics graduates in my team and they contributes a lot. Based on the old rule, I expected they could work for me for at least 29 months(even without H1B visa).The bureau should keep the consistency of its rules and protect its reputation. Cancelling the OPT extension would severely harm the growth of small tech companies that could not provide H1B sponsorship.
