To those that study hard subjects that benefit the society in the most efficient way, it is important for government to encourage these students to contribute what they have learned back to the society. After all, we work hard, recognize and admire the American value and want to contribute and construct the society. It is highly pathetic for those incompetent to sabotage the hard-working students just because they are slack and are not good enough to make company choose them baca use their contribution value is too low.
