I am supporting this rule, and I want to debate with the people who are opposing to this rule!
Many people says international students are using too much educational resources in the US, but I think that is totally wrong. I am international students graduate who has pursued a master's degree in the US university, like most of my international classmates, I have paid 40 thousands dollars per year as tuition, if the school has thousands of international students like me, how much money will be contributed to improve the whole US educational system? The school will use our money to build more building, buy more lab equipment and hire more experts which will no doubt benefit US citizens! If Opt Extension was cancelled, I believe the international students will dramatically decreased, if that day comes, the United States is the biggest loser!
Many opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants' contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.
