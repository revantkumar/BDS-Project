I work with international students EVERY DAY and have for over 16 years. OPT while it seems like a good idea is taking away jobs from Americans, #1. AND......90% and higher of these students that are granted OPT use it as a way to stay in the US, most of our college graduates DO NOT GO HOME. I have seen this first hand. They use it to get in the door and then have their employer sponsor them for an H visa and or they apply for permanent residency and get it. STOP GRANTING OPT AND RESIDENCY FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My own daughter cant find a job. STOP!!!!!!!!!!
OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. That is my social security money and my parents and grand parents. STOP IT NOW!!!!!!!!
