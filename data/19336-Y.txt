I recommend this OPT extension. As a new STEM graduate student in the America, this proposal will highly influence my future destiny and, whats more, hundred thousands international STEM students working career. I am going to list some advantages of this proposal.

First, the IT industries are still prospering in America and increasing number of employee will be needed. My graduate school campus is in Brooklyn and we all know that the Brooklyn Tech Triangle has given birth to many start up companies these years. STEM employees are urgently needed in those companies. OPT Extension will bring positive effect on those start up companies. 

Second, OPT Extension could attract more intelligent and world-class students come to US. Nowadays, many students among the world are trying to study aboard. Usually, America, France, United Kingdom and German are four ideal places to fulfill their dreams. If these proposal works, America may will be the place crowed with elites.

Third, I believe native American students are outstanding enough to win their jobs after graduation. It is unfair to say that the OPT Extension will impair the opportunities of native workers. The world is flat and every country in the World should properly accept the impact from fusion with other countries, let alone a place pursing freedom. As a developed super country in the world, America should give more opportunity for the international workers rather than restraining it. 

Forth, the time slot of OPT extension was not enough at first. In the OPT Extension before, which is 17 months long, there already existed many students who had got a job but were evicted as result of incapability to get H1B VISA, I will never forget the depressing face of my friend who suffered the same tragedy. Therefore, This proposal will appropriately give us more time while seeking jobs.
