I also strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:
1)The U.S. consists of immigrants from the old and most of them made a huge contributions to this country. For example, lots of people came to America during The Second World War, most of them are professionals, engineers and scientists (Albert Einstein is one of them). This is why American developed so rapid and strong after the war. The STEM OPT extension rule is right to keep these American future elites.
2diversity is very important towards the culture of America.
3)The request to place the right of citizens over non-citizens is simply RIDICULOUS. Just remember, every citizen or their ancester once was an immigrant.
