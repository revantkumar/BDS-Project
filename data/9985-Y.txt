Gayle Weber I oppose expanding the Optional Practical Training program (a proposed Dept of Homeland Security rule, I understand). I worked 20 years in STEM jobs, and I have seen wages and working conditions held down by the high number of cheap, fearful foreign workers on "conditional" visas. Employers won't have to pay payroll taxes on these OPT workers. It is beyond naive and bordering on malicious for this administration to expect employers not to replace their American workers with this source of cheaper, more compliant (ie lots of unpaid overtime, no demands for employer-sponsored training) labor. This administration needs to stop chipping away at good jobs, wages and working conditions for US citizens by telling us its for the "greater good" (economic efficiency, humanitarian necessity, etc). Good jobs are good for America. Stop undermining working conditions!
