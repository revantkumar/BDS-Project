I was a F-1 visa holder and luckily got H1-B. From the school and work experience in the past 4 years, I could not express more about the benefits of diversity to BOTH international and American students/ coworkers. I am, or we, internationals are so different in the way we think, communicate, and social. Yet we learn SO MUCH from one and another. I just love some of my American friends, they love me too. It is such a wonderful experience being able to study and work in a blended environment.
