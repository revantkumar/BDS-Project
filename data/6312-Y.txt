Le Hou I definitely support this new OPT extension rule.
1. Studying in the States is already very hard for international students. Students who managed to graduate have proven themselves to be smart, motivated, and work hard. They deserve a chance to show their talents at this wonderful country through their lives.
2. In order to absorb the top-tier engineers and researchers, students graduated from college and graduate school should have chances to work in the States for a decent amount of time. Without the extension, most of the students will have to leave the country, even if they are the bests.
