New OPT extension rule is important for both international STEM students and US STEM related industries.
1. OPT extension will help international students who are taking advantage of using OPT keep their life in plan. If it terminated, most of people life and career plan will be heavily interrupt.
2. Students who are using STEM OPT have all taken US high-level education, many of them has master or PHD degree, these intelligences are good quality work forces in STEM industries, they are creative, highly educated. In the future, they will definitely have more contributions to US STEM industries, build their own startups, create more working opportunities for the whole US society.
3. STEM OPT is only a small part of foreign working permits. H1B, of course, is the largest visa for international workers. However, it has been abused by many outsourcing companies. They support foreign workers to apply multiple H1B at once. These make large number of foreign workers enter US job market and unfair to people who studied, working and living in US. So STEM OPT is not the major conflict at all.
