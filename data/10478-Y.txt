A Mathew I strongly support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. This is important for ensuring availability of critical STEM talent for US tech industry leadership. Remember, we are competing internationally for global talent and we do ourselves a huge favor by properly developing and integrating this invaluable human resource.
