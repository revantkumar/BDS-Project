I am a engineering majored student and currently working with my OPT. I did not get selected by the H1 B visa this year and had to apply OPT extension. If next year I still couldn't be selected, I have to stop working. This is sad. Because this is my first job. The company trains me for a long time, I really want to gain more experience and also payback to the company. If I just stop there, it is also a waste to the company. 
If we have this new rule, we can have more chace to apply work visa. Also we can work more with OPT at least.

I think this is good for both companies and students.
