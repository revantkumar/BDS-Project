I strongly SUPPORT this ruling!

International students could create diversity and more creativity. High tech companies needs tons of talented programmers to work for them. But what's the ratio of talented people? 1 out of 100! We need a significant large pools for selecting these talented young people. Let's see sports leagues such as NBA, MLB, MLS, is there a rule like this?

It is a wrong saying that OPT students could take over American's job offers by salary advantages. As an HR I could tell you NO. And we are not willing to recruit them because teams usually need communication skills. If American citizens could have same qualifications, why we need to risk a high chance that he could not get H1B lottery?
