I STRONGLY SUPPORT the opt-extension policy because of the following reasons:

1. The US education system can benefit a lot from the opt-extension rule. The most important reason why so many international students come to US for education is the opportunity to work here and apply the knowledge they have learnt after graduation. And they have paid a large amount of tuition to thousands of colleges in US. Now days, many other countries such as Canada, England, Australia, they all offer work opportunities to international students. If the opt-extension rule was disapproved, it will make the education in US very much less attractive, which will damage the education system not only in a short term, but also in a long term.

2.It will be a disaster for the economy if the opt-extension rule is disapproved. Most foreign STEM talents choose to stay and work in US only because of the OPT extension rule and they have made huge contributions to US economy. Without the OPT extension rule, so many STEM talents will choose to leave US and work in other countries, and the detrimental effect on US economy is obvious and clear. And those US-high tech companies (Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook etc) also won't agree with the termination of opt extension rule because they are all supported by thousands of international STEM talents.

3.OPT extension rule can guarantee the continuity of projects. For example, I work in a automobile component company and most of the projects we are doing will last at least two years, and the opt extension rule can give enough time to international STEM employees to apply their skills and finish the projects, which will definitely benefit the company and the economy.

There are a lot of other reasons why I support the OPT extension rule and I cannot list them all. However, what I have said can clearly show my support for the rule. The opt extension rule is beneficial for companies, for the economy and for United States.
