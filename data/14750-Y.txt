I strongly support the new OPT STEM extension rule because:
1. It provides a great platform for international students to get valuable industry experience and utilize their knowledge gained from their studies (MS/PHD) in USA.
2. They highly contribute to the economy of USA and play a big role in maintaining unity in diversity.
