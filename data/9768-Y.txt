As a Google employee, I believe that OPT workers like me are doing our best to apply our knowledge in science and engineering. We make significant contributions to the technology development for the good of United States and the world. We write codes for products used by almost everyone in the United States every day. By allowing OPT extensions, we have better chance of keep on doing so.
