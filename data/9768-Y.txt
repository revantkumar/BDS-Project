Francis Loh I strongly support this rule. I was born and raised in the U.S. and will soon finish my undergraduate education at Harvard. Disallowing international students from working in the U.S. would discourage international students from applying to U.S. universities and ultimately hurt the US in the long run. These international students make an invaluable contribution to the US economy; many of my international friends are now working in the country after graduation and are taking up challenging jobs in high demand.

As a STEM major myself, it does not feel like they are taking away jobs from citizens in their fields of study. The talents and different perspectives of our international students have enriched our campus life both in school and post-graduation. I've benefited enormously academically from teaching fellows or study partners who are international students; these bright students likely would not have studied at a US university if there were little chance to stay in U.S. after graduation. One of the US' biggest assets in soft power is its global reach through university education and permanent attraction of talent.

This is the modern embodiment of the American dream, and we should give such opportunities to the current generation to realize their dreams. Historically, the more the country is open to the world, the more it benefits. Being blindly conservative in this regard would only hurt us in the long run.
