I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Diversity is what makes America, AMERICA. That is the foundation of the country. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It inspires more innovation and creativities in the field of science and technology.
