As a H1-B VISA holder, I strongly support this proposal. It is the OPT extension that allows me to get the H1-B and continuously working for my company which means contributing to the US economy.

1. Some American citizens are very worried about the competition this OPT extension regulation will bring. However, the fact is that the job opportunity is equal for everyone no matter the race, color or nationality. Only the talented and hard working individuals will get the jobs and they deserve it. Futher more, this OPT extension will simulate the job hunting competition in a good way. It will give both talented internationals and US citizens appropriate pressure to make them study and work harder and harder to get a job, which will improve their own capabilities.

2. Almost all the internationals are paying very expensive tuitions in the US universities. They have learned all the knowledge in the US universities which will prepare them well to contribute to the US companies and essentially strengthen US economy. Especially this OPT extension is exclusively for STEM majors, which will keep the US competitive in terms of technology, engineering and scientific fields. Plus, more and more potential international students will be encouraged to come the US universities if this rule can be approved, which will bring tons of money to the universities and the colleges.

3. OPT extension is not a immigrant type of VISA, it only gives international students more time to contribute to the US economy while they practice their knowledges in the real world. Only very few amount of the students will get the draw for H1-B and stay in the US. Therefore, I don't see any points that the OPT extension will let more students stay in the US illegally.

Lastly, I do hope rule makers and the government can consider and evaluate this rule very carefully. Not only for international students, but also for the US economy and development in a long term.

Thanks.
