I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many distinguished people in US have learned in US and kept working there. Among them there're Staya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, Harry Shum, EVP of Microsoft, Qi Lu EVP of microsoft, Kaifu Li, EVP of Microsoft, 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Foreign students don't grab jobs from US citizens. They fill the positions that can't get enough native candidates and will contribute more to US's consumptions and help creating more job opportunities for local business.
