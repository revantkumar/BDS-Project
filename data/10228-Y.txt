Patrick Bertelsen I'm a green card holder and a co-founder for a tech startup of 11 people. If the OPT extension regulation failed, more than half of my employees have to leave including our CTO and several core developers. In this way, we can definitely not deliver our products in time and I even doubt we could survive long enough to get the next investment. It would be shameful here not to be defeated by our competitors, but by the narrow nationalism!

I don't want to talk about any big theory but just one thing: do not kill our business!

Please do pass the regulation!
