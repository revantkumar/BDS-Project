24-month Opt extension is beneficial to the US economy. I strongly support this rule. 

1. It gives more time for the foreign elites' contribution to the US industries.

2. The no-new-immigration argument hinders the US absorbing the foreign talents. Why the US always rank No.1 country in the world. It is because of its open immigration policy, which attracts elites from all over the world to strengthen the US. The no-new-immigration argument has apparently go again this aim. 

3. 24-month Opt extension does not hurt local employees seeking a job. Uncompetitive people are still lack of competition without external competition. Hard-working and competitive locals are sure to find their satisfying jobs.
