It is really good for both international student and American economy. There are lots of position for the people who have specialty of STEM knowledge to fill. On the other hand,it is really easy for an american to find a job in STEM field because of their language advantage. However, their are much more positions in industry than native student could cover, and that is why the well-educated international student should be hired to fill this vacancy. For the reasons above, I strongly support this proposal.
