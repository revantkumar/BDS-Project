Studying in an American universities or colleges is a dream of many students. The unmatched study environment and being surrounded by talented people motivate me and my friends to work hard and do a better job. There will be better transitions for students who study here if they could have the hands-on experiences in the states after they graduate. I feel some majors, such as STEM majors might be better tailored to the industries in the United States. For example, I am studying actuarial science here. Insurance industries in the United States are quite different from other countries. I could be able to apply my knowledge and learn more by starting my career here. I am also able to bring in different perspectives to the companies, help them in their expansions in the oversea offices. That would be difficult for me to continue my career and realize my dream as an actuary by starting some places else.That's why an extension in training opportunities for F-1 students would mean a lot and benefit lots of parties. There will be more capable candidates, or labor supply, in our market. Reducing the waste in the resources in terms of college education is another point. The universities and colleges train F-1 students on average for 4 years and let them go back to their home countries is a waste of education resources. Instead, it is better to keep them. PLEASE reconsider the length of the training opportunities. Thank you.
