Strongly support this newly proposed rule for the following reasons:
1. STEM students may be able to fill in the labor gap currently existing in the high-tech industry.
2. The extension may allow STEM students to gain more practical experience, and potentially may result in more job opportunities for local united states workers, if some of them do start-ups after 2 or 3 years.
