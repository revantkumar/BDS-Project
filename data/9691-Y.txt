Living in San Diego and have an 18 yo son who still cannot find an entry level job anywhere. he has even applied to fast food chains despite feeling uncomfortable working there because he was the only non-hispanic english -speaking youth. Now looking for over 13 months. As a result of the constant rejection he has become quit hopeless and depressed. He is a good kid with morals, polite, well-spoken, integrity, clean-cut, and with good grades. He is giving up because he just does not know what to do anymore to get a break.
