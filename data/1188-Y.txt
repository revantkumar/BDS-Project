I'm an international students, and I love USA. OPT is very important for international students. Compared with native students, most international students are studying STEM degrees. As USA wants to keep the role as the leader in the world, industry and high tech are the most critical things to be developed and need a lot of professional people to work on this. Extended OPT will provide international students the opportunities to work for USA and contribute their knowledge to the world, and gain experience at the same time. It's a good thing for both students and USA. 
I hope the federal gov can approve the OPT 24 months extension request.
