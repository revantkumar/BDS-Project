I agree with this new OPT extension tules.

If the STEM extension is not continued around 70000 students have to leave the country by Feb 16th 2016 and their projects/work will be halted, because of there would not be enough skilled worker who just have has trained and gained the required knowledge to continue the work, this will affect employers/Industry for $70000000000 worth of projects/works/research and other revenues to US for 1 year till 16 Feb 2017. Imagine that suddenly on Feb 16th, Facebook website collapse, Google search engine collapse, your electricity supplier suddenly give you a call saying that there may be a lot of recovery work to do but they need more time and may stop service for your house few hours each day, just because these people who you have misunderstand have has been there to support for your everyday life, but you now force them to leave this country. That is totally not a good deal.

America is survived by the people, skilled workers and big and large business and it is the duty of DHS to protect the US economy and US people by enacting rules/legislation like this. If this is not done by DHS, who will do?
