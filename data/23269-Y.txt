I support the new OPT regulations for STEM graduates.

But I would like to bring to your notice that without first providing the Dual intent provisions to all f-1 visa applicants, and not just f-1 visa holders, through some kind of regulation or guidelines, the principle of equality of all applicants is being put at stake as those who are able to convince the visa officers that they would return to their home countres after studies are being allowed to pursue OPT, take benefit of extended cap gap, apply for h-1 and green card where as those who can't convince the visa officer are being denied a visa due to Immigrant Intent. 

As more than 90 percent never return, those whose visa applications are denied just because visa officers feels the applicant has Immigrant intent is total injustice and makes the visa application process a lottery and mockery of the system. I have seen some students with excellent grades and admission at reputable universities with Univ funding or full scholarships being refused visas because of lack of properties in home country where as those attending for profit and not so reputable univs with low scores and poor academics getting the visas. 

I request you to take appropriate action as part of Obama's initiative to streamline non immigrant visas, and provide guidelines or regulations to consider Dual intent not an obstacle for issuing visa , if visa applicant has good grades and going to attend a reputable univ, the kind of student your administration encourages to stay on using OPT,h-1 and green card and contribute to US.
