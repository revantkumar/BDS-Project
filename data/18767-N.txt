I am against any incentive to hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. Americans and young people getting out of college are having a hard enough time trying to find a job in their own country. Politicians are robbing Social Security and Medicare for funds to help pay for this program and the foreign participants aren't contributing back to our programs at all. Social Security and Medicare was sold to Americans as being a program to help our own retired citizens, not to use as a bank for politicians to fund whatever they want.These policies continue to undermine all Americans.
