The new rule will definitely be beneficial to the US, with regard to not only the economy but also to intellect and diversity.

Ex-International students make up a vast majority of (tech-) workers (and founders included). 
Eliminating opportunities for international students to join the workforce post graduation, you would be eliminating those great workers/founders who could help build the next tech giant.

Would that not be a terrible loss to all of us?

Besides, the tuition contributed by international students is considerably larger than those by local students. (At least 3 times). Disallowing international students from joining the workforce to gain practical experience will discourage them from enrolling in the first place, which would lead to loss in income for our universities. It would also mean loss in diversity and intellects, which could be a worse problem.

Last but not least, our universities train those students. If we don't take advantage of the result, other countries will. That would be a loss in grey-matter!
