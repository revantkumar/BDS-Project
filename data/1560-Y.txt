This rule will do more good than harm to America and its people.

Americans in the STEM fields are not robbed of their jobs by foreign students, but by the fair rule of a free market. Giving foreign STEM students a slightly (just slightly let's admit it) fairer chance to enter the job market will increase the competency of the talent pool. It benefits employers and America's economy, and in the long run, America and its people. American STEM workers' immediate interests may be hurt, but it is unwise to exercise stringent local protection in a globalized market.

Improving foreign STEM students' working opportunities follows naturally from the increasing number of foreign students being trained in US institutions. The sad truth still is, many foreign students who excel in academics and intend to work in America are devastated by the many obstacles (including pure luck) they need to overcome to get a job. This rule will help retain foreign talent.

If America still boasts as a proud immigrant country, this rule needs to pass. It should be universally agreed that one of the better paths to US citizenship is for a foreign national to enter the US work force after a US training. By passing this rule, America will be in a better position to thrive on its immigration policy.

To conclude, a great government can look beyond the lesser drawbacks of a policy and will choose what's best for the country and its people in the long run.
