As a public high school mathematics and science teacher, I feel it is vital that we have a continued support for the learners whom we are educating in our country. If there is not an adequate number of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) jobs available to our students, why are we pushing STEM-related curriculum in our country? By allowing additional people from outside our country to take the precious STEM careers from our learners, we hurt Americans--especially minority students who are highly underrepresented in STEM careers now and in the past. Let us logically evaluate bringing in additional workers from outside the country to take jobs away from American minority learners who so desperately need to be adequately represented in American STEMS fields and careers.
