As an employer, do you think I want to hire a temporary employee that can only work for me for three years, and during this time, I have to worry about his residential status and pay huge legal fees to get a visa for him? Of course I want to get a citizen so I do not have to worry about all this. But I CANNOT find any. Please do not tell me how many Americans with STEP degrees are out of job. They do not have the skills I need. If you are a citizen with a STEP degree, but you still cannot compete with a foreigner who is at the risk of not getting an permanent visa and may have to leave because of it, then who should you blame?
