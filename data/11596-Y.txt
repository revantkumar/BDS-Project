I absolutely support this proposal. It is a great idea to offer longer work training time for talented foreign student working for important industry. As for those who are saying this proposal would take away jobs from American people-it's not true. Here is why. OPT training time is not a permeate work visa at all. It is a time for foreign student to get a feel about potential work environmental. It's essentially an "internship visa."
