As a potential international student, I strongly support the proposal of extending OPT to 24 months.

As is known, the United States emphasizes equality and opportunity, which attract a lot of qualified technical personnel. If OPT is just 1 year, the United Stated can hardly attract these people as before because them need enough time to fit the life and many research projects need more than 1 year. And this short extension of OPT could deliver a negative signal to these people. In other words, it seems like that they are not welcomed and they are treated unfairly. 

On the other hand, why do many students apply for universities of the US? The working experience after graduate school is so precious that they give up the UK. If OPT is just 1 year, less talented students would apply for universities of the US, which means a loss for many universities in the US.
