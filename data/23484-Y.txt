I feel really grateful that DHS proposed this rule so that STEM OPT won't be terminated. 
But I believe 36 months should be more reasonable than 24 months due to the low probability to win H1b lottery nowadays.
And the E-Verify requirement in the proposed rules does really hurt students' career options. Many companies, even those in the tech sector, don't and won't participate in the program voluntarily. There must be better ways to effectively regulate OPT extension program rather than 'forcibly' bundle it with the E-verify program. Please, please consider removing the E-verify requirement here.
