One thing I know for sure is that if STEM OPT extension is canceled, many technical companies including really big ones like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon will lose a lot of working staff in one night and this gap will never be filled because it tends to be impossible to find this large amount of eligible candidates due to the reality that the "baby boom" has passed. It means US people is getting older and older and there's a serious lack of young labor for the whole society. The evidence is that the government now is running out of Medicare and Medicaid fund because more and more people are getting old, while less and less people are contributing the tax. To avoid this become worse, 24 months OPT extension can play as an effective stimulant. It can keep US government taxing and also slow down the speed of getting older, thus protecting the US economy.
