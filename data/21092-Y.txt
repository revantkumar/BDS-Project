I think this regulation will benefit US a lot. Most of the F-1 students are the outstanding people from all over the world. After graduation, if they can find a job, they have enough ability to fulfill job requirements because the companies will give offers only when these F-1 students can bring benefits. Actually, most of them are working hard and making great progress. And I didn't feel OPT extension lower the average salary. The reality is the opposite. Most tech companies are offering higher and higher salaries every year to recruit talented engineers etc., who will make the most contribution to the US's economy. I thinks it makes no sense for US gov to spend money to cultivate talented students and send them back to their own country to work. Instead, we should give the talented students opportunities to make progress here.
