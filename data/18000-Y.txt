As a graduate with a non-STEM major, I highly disagree and oppose this STEM extension because we, non-STEM and STEM, should be given equal opportunities to stay in the US. Just because they are STEM students, they are given more years to work in the US and thats not fair. We have paid similar tuition and it is not like the contribution from non-STEM student is less than those from STEM student.
