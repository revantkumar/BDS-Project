I strongly support the new rule. America is an immigration country from the first start of the history. Within these hundreds of years, immigrants have made so many big process on technology, economy, and social society. America choose to admit them, and they choose to return the America with their best knowledge and hardworking to improve the technology and economy in America. 
The highly educated foreign people from the STEM work hard for the America society after graduated. They pay the taxes legally. They try their best to contribute their knowledge to this country, but they still got so many blocks. The opportunities for local people and foreign people are totally different. Not the foreign people grab the opportunities, but they strive more than hundreds times than local people to get some opportunities that local people don't even wanna do it. 
I believe that the American spirits are to protect the rights for people to pursue their happiness. I believe that the American society protect the people who are hard working. No matter what they are, they are local people or foreigner.
