I do support this proposal a lot! International STEM workers have made huge contribution to US technology and US economy, their stay in America ensures our leading position in the world. I'd like to see STEM students staying in their jobs and not be forced to leave America because the time is out or whatever. 

We always put Americans first when we do hiring, but we also need the STEM students as I see most them work very hard and do their jobs well.
