OPT extension program should be sustained without any doubt!

Only one principle, the prosperity of a nation is driven by talented people. The United States, the most powerful country nowadays as well as a great nation founded by a group of brave, creative and talented immigrants, should know deep down this truth. 

Think about those great immigrants who work at important and leading positions in many great tech companies We all know how much they have contributed to the people living in this nation. In response to those who think foreigners took job opportunities away from Americans, I want to say that employers are not blind, they know what kind of people they need the most, to produce the best products, make the most profit, and provides the most favorable feedback to the public and government. 

Giving foreign graduates OPT opportunities doesn't mean they can stay forever, it is just a good method of examining if they are really useful for the country. If talented students with great potential were forced to leave without any chances, it is unquestionably a loss of the US. For those shortsighted people who claim foreigners occupies job opportunities, think about this simple logic, best talented workers create a strong, prosperous and wealthy nation, benefits everyone in this country, no matter you are highly talented with well-paid job or relative low-income earners. For those who are inadequate to compete in the job market, just frankly ask yourself, can you really live better in a mediocre nation with much less talented workers and creative companies? I doubt!
