As a 70 year old retired and disabled person I want to know how OPT managed to take $4 billion dollars from the Social Security and medicare trust funds?? Every day we hear about the trouble these benefit programs are in but it's ok for money to be taken from them??? I don't think so !! Our govt. has stolen from these programs before and they are no better than the thief on the street.

The Obama admin. has done all within its power to destroy this country with its immigration policies and blatent disregard for the American people.Obama has disregarded our Constitution and our laws and makes up his own laws,which are not legal.Yet the Immigration dept. follows these illegal laws.Nobody has the spine to stand up and say "NO !" wHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? dO YOU NOT CARE ABOUT THE American worker either? Take a hard look at what Obama has done and is doing to this country as a whole,then ask yourselves where your kids and grandkids are going to workand get a education.
