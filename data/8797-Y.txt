Haoyang Guo I support the stem extension! There are three reasons:
1. As an biostatistics student, I think I am better in mathestatiscs than many Americans. My knowledge and data analysis skills could bring benefit to US through more working opportunities.
2. The stem extension will not cause the American citizens losing the job, because we only get a job if we cannot be replaced by other Americans.
3. We need cultural diversity and Americans could get advantages through working with other countries people. We cannot deny the benefits brought by international graduates in many large technology companies like Google, Facebook. They will be impaired if the OPT stem is cancelled.
