America is a immigrant country. And diversity is one the most important properties. OPT offer a good option to both the international student and the companies in this country. The company could get more talent people and different thoughts from the people who have the different background. And student could have time to get the work experience to improve themselves. I think this proposal have much more advantages than disadvantage. And I definitely support it.
