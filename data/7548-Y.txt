Daren Andersen I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the country.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. to keep developing. Many outstanding people in US have made significant contributions to human beings, however, many of these people are not from US but from many other foreign countries. 

3. As someone experienced in the tech industry, I can tell you with my reputation that the tech companies can never hire enough talents these days. Go ask the hiring managers and recruiters, they will tell you the same. Yes, US probably has a lot of STEM people, but it simply does not have enough STEM talents. See, there is a distinction between normal people and talents. US needs the talents from foreign workers to keep its machines running well, and running better than the rest of the world.
