The new STEM OPT rule has been planned well, but the additional regulations like the "training and mentoring program" would affect the employment chances of a foreign student. Usually, graduates from Tier 1 and Tier 2 Universities end up working for a mid-level and small companies and this new regulations that come with the rule would put both students and companies under pressure and reduce the chances of employment opportunities for an international student. 

International students come to United States to pursue their advanced degree with a huge chunk of loan on their shoulders. Now that the additional clauses has been added to the new rule, this makes it very difficult for an international student to get an employment and pay back the loan on time.

Hopefully, this would be figured out and it'll be a huge relief for international students.
