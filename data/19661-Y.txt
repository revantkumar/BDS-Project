I strongly support this proposed rule which would be a double win for both STEM major international students and the US.

In short term, the high tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Tesla and Apple, they need strong background international STEM students to help them developing new features. Just look at how many OPT extension students now working at high tech companies, If this proposed rule get denied somehow, they gonna go home anyway. Then Huge loss would be caused to the US, since for any high tech company, it's definitely hard to find such amount of qualified employees, who have a Master or PhD degree with more than 6 years of STEM education and more than 1 year of work experience, in such a short time. It's not as easy as hiring a cashier.

In long term, this rule would help the US to keep attracting top talents to come to this nation and work for this country. Like Darwin's theory of evolution, only the best remains. Not only for STEM students, this also applied to competitions among nations.

Whether to keep words is also a matter of honest. These STEM students chose the US instead of others, like the UK, to continue their study with a major reason that they believe they would have at least 29 months' work experience.
