I strongly support the proposal for the extension of F1 OPT to 24 months. As it was mentioned in the proposal, during the OPT period, most of the funded project commonly undertaken in STEM fields can not possibly be accomplished within a short period due to their complexity and typical duration of research. I think the extension of 24 months is a necessity for F1-non immigrant students to finish their projects with good quality during the OPT period. For example, one of my previous roommate, who graduated with a master's degree in one of the Universities in DC area. He applied for the OPT and was granted the previous extension. He did really great job in his area during that period. However, in the middle of the project, he lost his legal status in the US because the deadline of the OPT period approached and he had to leave the US without an opportunity to finish the job he was interested in and also good at. I keep in touch with him through emails and it seems that he does a great job in his own country now and soon he is promoted to the project associate manager of his group. I think it is really tough for the US to lose those talented and skilled students after several years' good training in the universities at US, who could otherwise make great contributions to the society within years if they are granted the opportunity to the extension of their OPT.
