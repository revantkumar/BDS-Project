This 24-month extension would boost the U.S. economic growth by letting more and more talent and productive F1 students to stay longer in the U.S to do more contribution for the U.S. It also can stimulate the enhancement of technology and market competition for the U.S 
It's narrow nationalism minded and meaningless for considering the F1 students take away the jobs from American. U.S is a freedom and fair country, everybody should get what they deserved by how much efforts they made. we can create more jobs by developing a better economic for the U.S not by drive the talent and productive F1 students away from the U.S .we need to wide our vision and mind to think good benefits for the future. 
This 24-month extension will make the U.S to be a better country or even a better world.
