As a PhD student in Chemical Engineering, I strongly support the STEM OPT 24-months extension. The extension time would improve STEM student a chance to legally work in the United States, and use their cutting-edge knowledge in science and technology to contribute to the High-tech field of United State. As global competition becomes more and more severe, it requires people with high-tech knowledge to help better improve the society. The job opportunities created for talented international students would also give United States a chance to keep its level world wide. 

As we see, global companies like Samsung, Haier, Lenovo is becoming global leaders in -high-tech field. Keeping pace with these international companies, United States will need talented people from all over the world. Therefore, 24-month extension will only do more good than harm to the future of United States.
