I strongly support that OPT be extended. Here are my reasons:

1. The extension of OPT can benefit the U.S. in the long run. Since extended OPT is for STEM Program, which provides talents in strong mathematical, computer science and quantitative background, students from this program will contribute a lot to this nations innovation and economy.

2. United States of America is a nation of immigration. Protect immigrations is to protect American dreams. In this country, the companies hire talented people, no matter what color they are.

3. The extension of OPT wont decrease job opportunities for American people. The job market is recovering, and the extension of OPT can help the job market to be in a Virtuous circle. Only by creating a healthy competition environment can the U.S. make a larger progress.
