I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 

1) Immigrants who were once international students are making great contribution to the companies that they work for and the U.S. economy. America need those who work hard and make real contributions for a brighter future. There are so many living examples: professors, scientists, engineers who are from another country, and who were once international students.

2) That international students steal American job opportunities is an easy excuse for those who do NOT work hard. Just think why would a company go through all the troubles to hire an international student over a local student? It is just because they are better or more qualified for the position despite their disadvantageous status. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.
