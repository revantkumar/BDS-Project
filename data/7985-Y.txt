I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The highly competitive students in STEM would do a lot of contributions for the U.S. if they have a long OPT and they could help the U.S. become better and better.

2. As an immigrant country, diversity is very important in the U.S. The long OPT for STEM students could help this.

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing.
