I am in support of the OPT extension policy.

To begin with, banning this policy is a betrayal of the American spirit.

Secondly, less STEM international students workforce will do harm to the American economy, such as decreasing the income of universities and harming the real estate. 

What's more, in the long term, it is the USA that will suffer from the loss of talented people who just come back to their own countries since they can not stay in the US and make contribution to the development of the USA. 

To sum up, I strongly agree with the approval of this policy.
