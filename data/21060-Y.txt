Dear DHS,
First of all, I would like to thank you for the proposed rule. I being a international student know exactly how tough it is to find a job on OPT and also to take care of the Immigration Status. With this new proposed rule, I don't have to worry too much about the immigration status for 24 months as opposed to the current 17 months and I can make use of that time to learn and develop myself while contributing to the american economy.

I strongly urge you to pass this 24 Month rule.
