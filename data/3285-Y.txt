For a long time view, there are so many benefit for improving and expanding OPT. 

First of all, more and more students choose to back to their country after they truly handle the useful skills. 
Second, longer period OPT makes student have chance to touch the core of their work, so they will have chance to truly understand what they should do and focus on their career. 
Third, once there is chance that a company from the U.S wants to have a relationship with companies from other countries, international students will play a big role due to their experiences in the U.S, and this is definitely a great idea for the future economics and even politics. 
Also, all the student who have the chance to get OPT are higher educated, they could bring benefits more than some people groups which only ask their children stop being educated after high school.
And the last, international students usually work harder than others, employers can cost less money but get a stronger workforce. At the same time, small companies will be allowed to accept international students to work for them--usually a project will last for years, short time OPT make companies cannot accept international students to enroll the projects.

At the end, I want to say that expending OPT does not mean allow international students get green cards, it is just give the chance to build a better relationship with international students. From another side, people who can get green cards usually have been checked by immigrants department, and they are the people who can make the U.S be stronger and rich.
