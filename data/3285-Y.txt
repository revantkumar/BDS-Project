Ajinkya Rohankar I strongly SUPPORT the STEM extension program because of the following reasons:

1) All international students come in the US to get their Masters/ PhD's in STEM field especially in engineering. OPT program benefits all F-1 students to get hands on experience after their education which boosts the US economy. 

2) If this extension program gets destroyed, all students will return to their home country with enhanced degrees/ knowledge in their field which ultimately improves their country's economy.

3) Since only a handful students (US citizens) studies engineering in US, this country is facing a real shortage of engineers. Chose any university, irrespective of location, you will find only small (5-10) American people in a batch of 40 in Master's program in engineering. These numbers are very less in case of PhD's. 

4) In short, US needs lots of engineer's with enhanced degree's and knowledge. Without OPT STEM extension, US economy will definitely GO DOWN and you will see growing economy in the neighboring countries like UK, Europe India, and China etc. 
Increasing the extension period from 17 month to 24 months is beneficial to everyone. So I believe that everyone should support this program. Thank you.
