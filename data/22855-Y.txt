First, one attracting point of higher education in the United States is the possibility of gaining experience through working after graduation. One-year opt is much less attracting. One-year opt means students have to start looking for jobs in their own countries once they start their jobs in the U.S. Second, the training for a new employees requires several months. If the opt would be only one year, the time a new employee could devote to their position will be limited. Third, large amount of international students are beneficial to United States' development, who are hard working. And the fields they are working in, especially for STEM students, are less likely chosen by Americans. Even if they may apply to same position with Americans, most campaniles are more likely to consider Americans first, considering the visa sponsorship.
