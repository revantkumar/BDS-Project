I STRONGLY support the proposal for the following reasons. 
I think one of the important parts in the US is the diversity. lots of international students make great achievements. In addition, they need more time to make continual contributions to the most developed country. What's most important, it would NOT influence the job competition in the US. IN FACT, it will make the society keep developing in a right way.
