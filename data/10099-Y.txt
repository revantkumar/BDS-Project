The proposed rules are unacceptable and inappropriate. They are unequal, treating brilliant students in non-STEM fields less generously than STEM students. They continue and worsen ongoing harm to US citizen students and professionals, robbing them of internship and training opportunities in a time of unemployment 2-3 times what is typical of historical periods of near-full employment. OPT should be limited to 3 months per degree, with a 21-day transition grace period. F visas should be limited to only the top 1%, and OPT to only the top 1% of that 1%. Similarly, H-1B visas should be limited to the top, the very best 1,000 applicants per year; not those with this degree or that credential, but to the genuinely brightest and most-skilled. And L visas should be restricted to only those with very specialized scientific or technological knowledge, no to any of a wide range of general subject areas, but those in genuine extremely narrow niches within a subject/application area. Stop flooding the zone, and let the flood of the last 50 years subside.
