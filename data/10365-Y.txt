I'm supporting the rule "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students" mainly because of three reasons. 

1. By extending the STEM OPT, there's a moderately higher chance for F-1 students to get H1B, and most of the F-1 students with H1B will stay at the same company to keep their H1B valid. Therefore it's good for the companies hiring F-1 students because it's more possible for them to keep experienced and qualified employees, and the profit of the companies may increase, which will eventually turn into benefit for all employees in the company or higher revenue which benefits the whole state/nation. 

2. To be honest, plenty of companies especially those big companies with good benefits are not providing sponsorship for international students (it might be a different case for the IT industry, but that's also because the industry is still booming and requiring plenty of employees, as well as the ratio of native students in computer science related subjects are relatively lower), so lots of international students are working in small and medium scale companies, doing the job that may not seem very appealing, while not many native students are willing to pursue these kind of jobs. Thus extension of OPT won't lower the chance for native students to get a decent job. 

3. The extension of OPT would attract more international students to study in the United States, and this is actually a considerable income for not only the universities, but also house rental, cars dealership as well as food industry. 

These are my reasons for supporting the rule, it's a little bit lengthy but I hope that people can read it patience and think about it objectively.
