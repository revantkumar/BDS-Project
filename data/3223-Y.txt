Sean Chang I definitely SUPPORT the extension of OPT. The STEM graduates are the driving force of the new technology industry, which is what makes the US the greatest country in this world. Many of these foreign graduates finish their education on our NSF funding. If we force them to leave without contributing to the US economy, it would be a huge waste of taxpayers' money. What's worse, they will probably go work for other countries that are against us. We are essentially helping other countries to challenge the US if the extension is not passed. I just can't imagine a more stupid deal.
