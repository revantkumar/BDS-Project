I am a Master student in Electrical Engineering at UC Riverside. I strongly support the OPT extension to 24 months for STEM students.

I am right now hunting jobs and have attended a few career fairs. Some employers would not really care about us by the time they knew we are international students. It's not because such job requires U.S. citizenship; it's just because they don't think we are worthy for H1B sponsorship after 12+17 months. Think about it: imagine yourself as a recruiter and you just meet a person in less than a minute, then you have to consider sponsoring him/her after 29 months. Yes, even 29 months is a "short" time for them.

However after I knew DHS may extend the extension time to 24 months, I changed my expression when asked whether and how long I could work in U.S. I said I could have as long as three years to legally work here. Such expression - three years - does give employers a shock in some sense. From my experiences, some employers does keep showing interests to me after such answers and we had some good results after that.

Just imagine yourself as recruiter and you are doing a career fair or info session, two international students approach to you. You know both are competent for the job. Then you ask them, how long can you legally work in the U.S.? One says 12+17 months, the other says 3 years. Whom would you choose?
