Yuan Xiao I strongly SUPPORT the new rule, because I honestly believe it is a win-win strategy. 

For the US public, the extension allows the US to keep the best of foreign students without putting pressure on employment of US citizens. From my personal experience, the foreign students who are able to find jobs that support STEM visa are the cream of the crop. It will be cost-effective for companies to hire foreign students only if they are truly outstanding due to the additional visa related costs. Use myself as an example. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from a top 10 (based on US News and World Report) university with double majors in economics and computer science. However, I know I'm not taking away jobs of other US citizens. I've interviewed with many tech firms, and almost all of them are having trouble filling up their half-empty teams. Even if they had hired all the qualified STEM students, I'm confident that they will still be looking to hire more.

It's also a big win for foreign students with STEM degrees like me. The teachings of the US colleges are mostly applicable to jobs in the US, but may not be as relevant in their home countries. For example, the knowledge I learned about economics is of limited application in my home country due to drastically different economic system. 

America became a superpower not because of its natural resources, but because of its people, a people comprised of the best and brightest from all over the world. Many of the best and brightest young people are among the foreign students studying in top US colleges and working for firms in the US. They are an asset to the U.S. Don't squander it simply because of the self-interest of one group.
