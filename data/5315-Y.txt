I am strongly supporting the OPT extension.

I have two major reasons here.

1) The United States is a country of equality, which means everyone has the equal right to work, regardless of citizenship. Due to the situation of H1B lottery, OPT extension can be critical to those international students to continue their work if they lost the lottery. And because of this consideration, the employee may not hire such students. This leads to a kind of discriminated status to the international students when looking for a job.

2) The OPT extension is for those STEM majors, which is very important to the economics in US. In this era full of technology and information, well-trained personnel in STEM will be greatly contribute to the well-being in the United states and the world. OPT extension provides opportunity to such personnel to prove their values of professional knowledge. 

Thanks for the considerations!
