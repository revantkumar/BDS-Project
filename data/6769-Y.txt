Anonymous Being a student myself, graduating from MIT and having used the OPT program, I am amazed at how hard US makes from top talent to keep working in the country. USA has one of the most restrictive and unfriendly policies when it comes to hiring talent from foreign students in US universities. I have hundreds of my friends ( phDs, MBAs, scientists from US universities etc) who left the country as they were not able to get a H1B. All of them are doing great elsewhere - only one has lost - the US economy. It make sense that they would want to restrict people move directly to work here from abroad, but students who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollar and time going through the education process deserve much better.
