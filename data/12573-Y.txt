I strongly support this rule for the follwing reasons:
1. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT and Engineering are.
2.It's good for US education because longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
3.Immigrant-friendy culture in US has made it the best country in the world. More talented students work in US after graduat will help US better develop it's own technology.
4.Most of the talented students who come to study inUS deserve more time to practice their skill after graduation
