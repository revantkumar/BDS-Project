We, The People, created a system to protect and serve the United States. We did not ,Nor do we Approve, the actions of any Government Official to Circumvent the laws in place do to language differences from origination of the Congressional membership to today's standards of practice.

This idea of amending, to suit the needs, of the democratic or republican party's is not what we want nor approve.
Please Reverse the additions added to this and make the law mean something again.
I for one Reject the Idea Congress can,At Will, do what ever they want with funding,Bills, Foreign Students status, and or any other Revisions to the original concept laid out within the constitution of the United States Including their own Salary's.
