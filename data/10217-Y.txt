I totally SUPPORT this new OPT policy.

Some people said jobs should be kept for Americans. But OPT students do not stole such jobs. The companies decides who they would like to hire. They would like to hire candidates who is qualified for this position, who could contribute more to the company, to U.S. OPT students is not the reason that Americans do not find a job. Actually, U.S.citizens already have a lot of advantages; some companies do not even hire international students, they only hire people who do not need sponsorship.

International students really contribute a lot to our country. Think about the software engineers in San Jose, they work more than 8 hours a day and have little rest time. They supports Google, Facebook....; and such companies play a big role for America's economic development. If such IT companies could not work normally, how big the influence will be to the whole America? We will do not have money for education, medical and army.

So I really agree with this new policy and hope that it could be accepted.
