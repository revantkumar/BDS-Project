My experience convinces me OPT extension is definitely a good policy. I am a senior software engineer in Facebook and have been working with new grads from India, China, and other places, who used OPT extension to maintain status. All of them are smart, hard working, pleasant to work with. I felt OPT extension brought those smart young engineers from all over the world. Without those smart, diligent young engineers, high tech company's today's success has been not even possible. US should give an earnest welcome to them. Also, with the extension, it doesn't mean us give them permanent status. It's only temporary. So, the extension is a reasonable solution for them.
