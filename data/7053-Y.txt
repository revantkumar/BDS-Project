I fully support the expansion of OPT for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees. Just to clarify first, I'm not a STEM student, thus this policy will not have any positive impact on my study or job hunting. That's why I can be totally objective about it.

First of all, this is just an improvement and expansion of the opportunities for STEM F-1 students. The American job market is still more appealing to its natives. I believe people are hired based on their abilities, and there is no evidence that foreign students are taking over this resource. Actually, most foreign students are only able to do ground work, and are excluded from the management level jobs. 

Second, US has nearly 1 million of foreign students coming to it in 2013. What does this mean? A large consumption in daily necessaties, transportation, health care, bank deposit, not even mentioning the huge education expense. I don't see any benefit in limiting this market. 

Thus I want to say this policy is an opportunity for United States to connect better with rest of the world and to maintain the stability of its economy. I also hope people who commented maliciously can treat this with more rationality and understanding. This is the only way we can work it out together.
