Vivekananda Bandyopadhyay Hello,

First I would like to thank the DHS for updating the current rule and publishing it for comments.

I fully support the new legislation as it provides fair opportunity for highly skilled professionals in STEM fields to contribute to the betterment of the United states and therefore, the rest of the world. 

It encourages pursuit of stem degrees for students throughout the world, continuing the US's reputation as the most attractive destination for the world's brightest.

For years, foreign born professionals have contributed greatly to the nation's great institutions and the overturning of the opt extension rule would have seen a significant drop in their numbers. The impact of that would only be negative.

This in my opinion, invalidates or gives an unfair advantage to foreign born students and professionals as they are selected purely on the basis of merit anyways. The spirit of competition and merit is the foundation stone of this country.

I hope this new rule is published for the advantage of one and all.

Thank you.
