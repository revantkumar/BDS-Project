As an American, I am extremely proud of the heritage that we have of welcoming those to our shores who are trying to better their lives and the lives of their families. My own ancestry includes a young man from Western Russia who came here prior to World War I and thought himself a king because when he was an older man he owned a small shotgun house in St. Louis, Missouri. So many families in this country have similar stories, it is foolish to say that we are NOT a country of immigrants! Indeed, it was those who sought a better life here that made this nation what it is today. 

Unfortunately, what I see now is an immigration policy that is lenient to those who enter this country by breaking its laws, yet tough on those who truly seek to live here legally, work hard and make a better life for themselves and their families. I am privileged to know people from other countries who had the bravery to leave behind their homes, relatives and cultures to come here and apply themselves at out institutions of higher learning. It saddens me to see how difficult our country's government makes it for them to stay here legally once they have graduated and are searching for a job. We have a significant population of people who so desire to be here and to live the "American Dream." It is a travesty that we should seek to force them to leave after they have graduated, simply because their visas are only for studying. I urge you to allow these courageous young people to stay and continue to pursue their own American Dreams as they find employment and start families in this country. It is, perhaps, the greatest way that we can honor the legacy of those who came before us with so little so that they may earn so much.
