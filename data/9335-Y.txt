I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:

1. There does have competition, but it is a good thing for labor market.
Look at the international who are able to find a job in US, they are excellent students. 
They can help improve US economics and stimulate American young people to work hard. Why is it a bad thing?

2. If the attractive of US education went down because of the OPT extension cancellation, the great advantage US has over other countries will be affected. 

3.Diversity, which is the foundation of US will also be doubt.
