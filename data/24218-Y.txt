I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1.With this proposal, international student will have more chances to make contribution to the U.S. I think that U.S. government should use this policy to let and encourage international student use the knowledge they learnt in the U.S. to make contribution to this country. To tell the truth, visa is quite a problem for international students to work in the U.S. Like the co-founder of Instagram, Mike Krieger, who is a F-1 student from Brazil when he created Instagram. At that time, he had a problem with his visa and almost had to leave the U.S. and gave up Instagram. If there is a policy like this, he will have more time to fulfill his idea and deal with his visa. There are a lot of international students who are now facing or will face visa problems. Among these students, especially STEM students, there will be a second Mike who will make their great contribution. This policy will give these students more time to work in the U.S. 
2.Talk about the competition, this is not a problem. According to proposal, STEM students do have more time to find a job and to work in the US, but the job they found have to be associate with their major. As we all know, STEM students will hold roles like engineers, programmers and developers, which are in high demand positions. In these industries, like IT and consulting, the supply is not adequate to the demand, and most American people are not finding jobs in these industries. Because of this, this policy will not take away work opportunities from Americans, so the competition does not exit in some extent. On the contrary, international student are filling the blank of U.S. job market.
