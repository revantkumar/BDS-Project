I strongly support this. With the transition to the digital economy (all of those big data, internet of things, artificial intelligence etc.), America is already facing severe competition from foreign countries such as India and China. "America is in danger of falling behind," President Obama stated in 2010. He labeled the crisis "our generation's Sputnik moment." However, the demand has outpaced the supply and our universities aren't generating enough graduates to meet the demand, leading to a big 'skill gap'. With the policy of allowing more practical training time for those STEM students to be very much helpful in filling this gap and help keep America in the lead among its global rivals. Those who are talking that this caused Americans lose their jobs should have thought twice. There is no relationship between the job loss with the STEM students at all. Even though we sent those STEM students away, are there enough Americans that can do the jobs? We need to keep the momentum of high tech industry going, which contributes the GDP growth tremendously and leading America take its position in the Internet Economy across the globe. 

This is just 3-year temporary time so I don't see it hurt America in the long term and those who are willing to stay at America and become citizens will serve and contribute to America in their entire life with their strong technical skills - so why prevent them from doing so? People have the freedom of choosing what they want, and this is the enduring spirit of America. This is also how our ancesters came to this land and chose to stay here.
