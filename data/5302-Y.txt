1) YES! I DO STRONGLY SUPPORT the opt-extension. (2) I believe OPT-extension if NECESSARY for the US. (3) YES, OPT-extension would be in the best interest of this nation

For the stem graduates who has the most advanced degrees the universities have, the US government spends tens of thousands of dollars to support each and everyone's study and research. 

For what? 

For after we finished the study, we can bring everything we learnt to where we come from, to outside the US? 

That way, the US has done the world such a contribution through financing millions or billions of dollars to cultivate scientists and engineers and they can later compete with this nation in economy, science, engineering, politics and so on and so on. And to stress again, that money comes from tax payers in this very nation.

Rather than listing the benefits for us, I have put it very clearly the damages in terms of $$$$$ by pushing out the STEM graduates, unless the American people and government are stupid, it is more than clear what is the right thing to do.
