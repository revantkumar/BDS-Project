I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Based on the work experience from some of my colleagues and classmates, most large research analysis, software development, or other projects of similar kinds would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers would lose their VISA before the projects completion, this must be a big lose for both the company, 
laboratories and these STEM workers.
