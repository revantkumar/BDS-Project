As an STEM student, I would like to support the proposed OPT extension program. The STEM extension not only benefits the employer and the student but also it helps to create more jobs indirectly. If this rule is established, then the nation will eventually attract more STEM students and it can widen their innovation base. Please keep the long-term benefits of this rule in mind while finalizing the rule.
