U.S. economics heavily depends on various high tech companies and advanced manufacture factories, such as Google, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, etc. The reason that these industries are always winners in the worldwide competition is because most of the excellent people in the world work for these companies. F-1 OPT extension program provides much more possibility for these companies to continuously attract excellent international students. Thus this policy should be very helpful to U.S. economics development. Once these companies and industries will become stronger and bigger, there should be more employment positions for U.S. citizen, thus this is a positive contribution to U.S. 

I definitely support the extension program.
