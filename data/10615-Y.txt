David Cop This is a very good proposal which is beneficial to both the US society and the F1 students. As a nation of immigrants, the United States of America is famous for its diversity and compatibility, that's what makes this country the best in the world. Free, equality, and competing make the society keeping progress. People also gain from their contributions to the society. Extended OPT offer students from abroad a relatively better opportunity to find a job and making their contributions. Besides, this will consequently enhance the ability of domestic students as well who will improve themselves to keep their position and advantage. There is no need to worry about this extension, because when you think about the future of this nation, the gain will outweigh the loss.
