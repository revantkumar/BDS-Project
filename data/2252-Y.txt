This is about education. America is a great country and one of the only few places to provide with quality education and opportunities. This is the place where people come to realize their dream. Please don't take that away from us. Let the students live. Let the students fly and make this world a better place. You never know, a student who doesn't get an OPT extension might be on the verge of finding a cure for Cancer. You wouldn't want to devoid the world of that.

Please let the OPT extension prevail.
