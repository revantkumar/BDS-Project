I strongly support the STEM extension, and also quite disgusted by some commenters' sense of entitlement! Cancelling the STEM will not be beneficial for the US economy at all! On the contrary, it would only wasted the money U.S has invested on the international STEM students. Yes, US HAS invested money on the international students by offering them scholarship or fellowship. Now are we sending them back to their home after spending tens of thousands of dollars on each student? Did we just help their country to train their citizen for free? We would be nobrainers to do so! 
Leave them here for a while to serve us and select the best of them would be the best options!
