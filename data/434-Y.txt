Vivian Liu I totally support this policy. Thousands of excellent students who studied hard to get an chance to work in US. These talented students deserves more time to practice their skills and their work also contributed to the improvement of this country's economy. Longer opt time will attract more creative and talented foreign students come to study in America.
