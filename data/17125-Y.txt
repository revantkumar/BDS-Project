The argument that extending OPT by 24 months will take jobs away from Americans and hand it to aliens is not completely true. No business goes looking for aliens with specialized degree they could hire. These many aliens stay and get work in the US because there is a need for them (for that many people with skills, aliens or otherwise), with the number of science and tech companies based in the US. US will never be able to retain its unparalleled advantage if it starts shutting the door in qualified aliens that want to lawfully work here. Some people here are making it sound like these are illegal aliens that engage in crime that we are talking about. Why shouldn't US let people that spent money on college education work and earn here? Having people who paid for their college education return right away is just unfair.
