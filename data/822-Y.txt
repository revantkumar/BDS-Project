I strongly support the new rue. 

I would like to remind my fellow US citizens that most of the critical and important jobs that require some levels of government clearance are never offered to non-citizens. I don't think this ruling would ever take any job opportunities of US citizen graduates. In addition, if you look at the output of international employees in US, there have been registered many innovations done by these guys which would never have happened if US did not provide this opportunity. 

In the company that I'm currently working at, there is not a single US citizen working in similar positions. There are several employees facing the issue of OPT STEM extension . If the extension doesn't get fixed, both the company (which is an international high-tech company) and the employees will get into trouble. The company would not be able to replace someone from US citizens in near future, if ever. 

I'm confident the economic impact of not getting passed this rule will soon be revealed. I hope it gets passed.
