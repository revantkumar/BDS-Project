TQ Hang I strongly support the current proposal proposed by administration, I think let US educated high skilled foreign worker stay is very beneficial to US economy, we have many examples of high skilled foreign students creating many new influential business, thus creating millions of job for US citizen. This country is unique because this country is built on immigrants, we should be inclusive to immigrants, not saying those whit high skilled STEM workers who are deadly needed, and will do good to US economy, to keep US the front runner.
