I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. Talented foreign students in the STEM field can make important contributions to the U.S. I know many sharp foreign students who are working at high-tech companies in the Silicon Valley, and they have contributed to the development many high-tech products, including Apple iPhone, Intel Xero CPU, UBER App, etc.

2. It has become increasingly difficult for employers to hire candidates with the proper combination of skills in the STEM field. Foreign students are very important resources for U.S. employers.

3. I dont think the foreign students are competing with U.S. workers in the job market. My experience is that U.S. employers always prefer to hire U.S. workers because the cost for hiring a foreigner is often higher, e.g., the company needs to be e-verified, needs to support H1B petition, and even deal with immigration issues, etc. Hence, a foreign student gets hired only when no proper U.S. worker is available for that position.

In summary, this new OPT rule is good for both U.S. employers and foreign students.
