Actually, we American rely on these international labor force to some extent. If the extension is cancelled, we will lose competence. I believe a lot of people would like to go to Australia where people live a comfortable life because of friendly weather. How could we win in this case? We really need more international students to improve our living standards. The short OPT (12 month) will deter them from going to America, especially those talents. So, I strongly agree with the extension. Hope this law can be passed. God Bless You!
