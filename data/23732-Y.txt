I would like to comment in favor of extending the OPT option for eligible F-1 students. I have worked with several students who have come from abroad to study in the STEM fields and I am constantly impressed with their drive, initiative and perseverance. Additionally, to me it makes sense for us as a country to allow these students to contribute back based off their education if they desire to stay in the country. Their contributions and insight have been incredibly valuable to our business and I would like to see this win-win option continue going forward.
