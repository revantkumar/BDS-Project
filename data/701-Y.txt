Hang Liu I strongly support this proposed rule. International students are making huge contribution to the this country rather than "stealing" welfare from US citizens. More than a dozen U.S. Nobel Prize winner were international students in America, current CEO of Microsoft once held F-1 Visa in America, countless talented scientists, professors and engineers in US are coming from all over the world. These no-citizens are making this society, economy and science better. They are not competing with common workers in America for jobs for they are mostly doing projects using cutting-edge technology. These talents are even creating job opportunities for America because they promote companies' competitive force in US, which will lead the economy turn up and thus more companies will hire more common workers.
