I was glad to see the proposed rule, especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.

Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus.

I support this decision for the reason that STEM students help in technological advancement of the nation and improve economy.
