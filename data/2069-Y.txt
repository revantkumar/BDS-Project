Michael S. Raper As a landlord in Hartford, CT, I strongly support this rule. International students are always my best tenants, especially Chinese students. They absolutely pay for the rents on time, never destroy anything, always keep quite, clean and polite and I do not have to worry about the police request. As a result, I would prefer them to rent my house. What is more detailed, I could make 12,000 dollars on per student without worrying about anything. I have two houses near Uconn and it is always their International students that rent my house. I can not imagine I will lose 72,000 per year if the rule goes away. If I lost them, I could not find better or even get enough lodgers.
