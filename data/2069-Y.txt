I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of this new STEM OPT extension. 

As an employee of a local automotive supplier company, I saw my company has faced the problem of finding enough qualified new mechanical engineers in the past few years. Obviously nowadays most American students tend to pursuit jobs in emerging industries such as IT and electronics company, as a result it's getting harder and harder for traditional industries to find new blood. This year my company starts to hire several international students to meet our needs and they do excellent jobs. Apparently if there were more candidates we can choose from, our company can hire better talents. So I do believe this new OPT extension rule will definitely keep our traditional industries competitive.
