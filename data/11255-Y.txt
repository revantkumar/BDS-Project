I totally support "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students".

I believe, to any student studying computer science, being able to work in or even create his/her own world top level IT companies is a dream to be fulfilled. This is our American dream and also part of the reason why we came here. United State is famous for its openness. It encourages young men/women to pursue their dreams through hard working. 

Along the path of fulfilling our dream, hard working has never been a problem. Some policies are. I am very happy to know that USA is thinking of expanding the opportunities for F1 students. 

Please believe that, we are not here to take the jobs aways from American, we are here to make the market bigger and create more jobs.
