As a retired university professor, I am aware of the pressure to allow foreign students to remain in the U.S. after completing their studies. My department had an emphatic policy of denying any such overstay after graduation. We informed all foreign applicants of this policy. It is shocking to see that some U.S. companies are now lobbying to keep such graduates in the U.S. as competitors to U.S. students. The proposed policy of allowing graduates to stay on in a policy disguised as "Training" is not in the good of our nation. It seems to represent the same kind of executive overreach as seen in other recent actions on illegal immigrants. I urge its repudiation.
