I highly support the new rule for OPT STEM extension to 24 months.

Countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China are actively instituting new strategies to attract international students.

For example, Canada also recognizes that educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent. In April, 2008, Canada modified its Post-Graduation Work Permit Program to allow international students who have graduated from a recognized Canadian post-secondary institution to stay and gain valuable post-graduate work experience for a period equal to the length of the student's study program, up to a maximum of three years, with no restrictions on type of employment. This change resulted in a 64% increase in the number of post-graduation work permits issued to international students in 2008. By 2014, the number of internationalstudents in the program more than doubled its 2008 total. In addition, Canada aims to double the number of international students in the country to 450,000 by 2022.
