I support the OPT extension for stem students.

1. If the extension policy is cancelled, many international stem students may have no chance to get h1b so they can only stay in America for a year. Many of them may simply choose to go back to their own country directly because one year seems really short for people who are talent and try to make some difference in this area. The science and engineering industries will face even more serious competition in the world because all the talents run away.

2. These international students don't steal native americans' job because to be honest, if two candidates are the same good, the employer will be more willing to choose the native instead of the foreigner. For those claim their jobs are stolen by foreigners, they may not be qualified for the position anyhow even without the international students. For high-tech companies in America, when they are so short for people that they have to give offers to some less-qualified people, it means they will soon loose the competitive position in the world.

3. With all the talents in stem majors going back, there are not only big companies like google, amazon, but also a lot of start up companies right now looking for employers from stem majors. This policy will bring really bad influence to some companies because they are not so strong as those big companies. It is really bad for the economics as well as the job market. We won't tell if it will be much more worse than some of the high-skilled positions taken by some international students.
