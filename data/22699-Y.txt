Some are arguing that OPT Program takes jobs away from their kids. They probably don't notice that this is just internship program, which only benefits very small portion of the whole job markets at very limited time span. Also, this specific extension is only valid for STEM fields in which their kids don't have that much interests but technology companies badly need those kinds of human power in recent years. Obviously, it will affect US job market to some extent, nevertheless, considering the longer time period, this will definitely help strengthen US technology industry.
