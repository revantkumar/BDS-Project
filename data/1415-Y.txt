Geyuan Liu I STRONGLY support the new proposed OPT extension rules. 

First of all, STEM majors are important to the growth of US economy and advanced research. As we all know, US leads the world in high-tech industry and scientific research. STEM majors are the foundation of these fields. STEM major international students who can work at US with OPT can contribute to the economy with their knowledge and experience gained during years of studying. Also, there are large amount of STEM major international students holding advanced degrees. These people with specific domain knowledge can keep high-tech companies and STEM research institutes staying competitive globally.

Secondly, OPT extension of 24 months or even longer are necessary. Projects involved with STEM majors usually take longer than one year to finish. If there is no OPT extension, companies and research institutes have to find substitutes in the middle of their ongoing projects. This will increase the costs of the employers substantially. With increasing costs, their ability to compete with foreign competitors will be harmed.

Finally, OPT extension won't harm US citizens. Some people concern that foreign students working with OPT don't pay social security tax. That is true. But, international students also don't have the right to receive social security when they get old. And some people concern that international students steal jobs from US citizens. The truth is that the amount of international students in US are tiny comparing to the total demand of the job markets. Also, STEM major jobs only take 5.6% of the total US job market. Most job positions are taken by US citizens. Moreover, even though there are some high-tech jobs taken by the international students, every high-tech job will create 4 more non high-tech jobs. Foreign students will help to create more jobs and reduce unemployment.

In conclusion, I believe the OPT extension is beneficial to United States in long term.
