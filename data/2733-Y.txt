Rosie Qiao I strongly support this proposal.
Foreign students in OPT would not take the job opportunities for local Americans'. On the contrary, there're actually still a lot of urgent job openings in STEM area that need new graduate students to fill in. 
From some point of view, having OPT and hiring foreign students may give more opportunity for Americans and create more job opportunities. Take silicon valley instance, STEM students get hired by those high tech companies and it becomes the best place to develop new technology. These people and these companies would bring a huge opportunities for real estate, medical and all kinds of local business.
Secondly, the profits, including taxes and other benefits, would be not only good for high tech companies but for all Americans. If without this proposal, may be one of third of people in high tech companies would have to leave. The taxes and other they bring would be at least one third less than now. The taxes could be used to build a new hospital or build another shelter for homeless people. But without this proposal it may not possible. Also the companies could not develop more technology and our mobile apps have so many bugs but there're not many people to fix them. and people's life could change a lot.
So I think this proposal is a great proposal because is benefit the high tech company, all US citizens and even all the rest of world.
