I strongly support this proposal. Honestly the government should make those international students who learnt knowledge and skills in US make more contributions to US. At the same time this proposal could make more and more talented students come to the US rather than UK or Canada, which is a great profit to not only all the universities and colleges but also every other industries every year. And of course, the last but not least. Everyone is equal. The groups of people make more contributions should get more.
