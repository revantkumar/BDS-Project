Traitors. How can you force young Americans out of jobs created for THEM, and send them to soup lines and homeless shelters, while robbing Social Security and Medicare by giving any other STUDENT from ANYWHERE else in the world American jobs? You can't even locate immigrant benefactors who were given these jobs in the past? The average American college graduate spends two years and sends out 200 resumes before landing a job here. Ninety percent of pizza delivery drivers in D.C. have college degrees. Both of my young daughters have student loans to pay off! You're giving their jobs away to immigrants who ARE Not needed. The Department of Homeland Security isn't needed now and never was. You will be closing up shop shortly.
