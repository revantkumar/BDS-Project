I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.
First, this proposal will create more opportunities for the US organizations to acquire highly-skilled and educated STEM candidates who are trained from the US higher education system. These candidates are very specialized and carry advanced degrees in the STEM fields. They are providing crucial contributions for the nation to advance in science and technology, which fulfills the need within the nation in the STEM fields, instead of creating competitions among the common workforce, which is the unnecessary concern from some people. 
Second, this proposal will help to maintain a good diversity environment within the US that allow people from different cultures work together to make contributions for the nation. With the different background, it promotes the communications, therefore generating more good ideas. This diversity and its benefits are well demonstrated by the US higher education system already. Furthermore, diversity enhances the understandings between different cultures. It encourages cooperation across the nation or even globally.
