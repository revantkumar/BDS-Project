Leon Tau I support the OPT extension for STEM student. STEM students bring much contribution to the US society. They did significant job for speeding up the high tech companies. STEM student are not going to steal the jobs in US. They enhance the creativity of this nation and the companies, which is definitely good news for US. If the extension is canceled, there are so many students that have to leave this country. They should have to a chance to contribute themselves.
