I definitely SUPPORT this proposal. The U.S. becomes the greatest nation because of its welcomeness to the most talented people all around the world.
Those who object this proposal are just short-sighted and sacrificing the future of this country. Kicking the international students away are just giving them to the competitors of our nation.
We are contributing to the development of China, India, and Europe by rejecting this proposal!
