Strongly disagree extension of OPT! Local people need more job opportunities. There are also lots of excellent and good graduates among local students. Top international students don't need OPT extension, they can find H1B sponsor rapidly. Opt extension only allow those not best international students staying in US and share the limited job opportunities with local people.
