It is very obvious that high-tech (STEM related) industry is crucial for America's future in the 21st century, and for high-tech industry, you need talented people in this field, which needs time to cultivate. Now the F-1 OPT serves (and have been proved) as a major source to allow talented STEM students to find their future in America. I think it is critical to improve and expand the OPT for foreign STEM students. 

There are people who claiming that foreign STEM students take the job from American people, but it is absolutely not true. The truth is, when a company or an industry is able to recruit more talented people, they will be more competitive and have a better chance to expand and then hire more people, as we have seen from Apple and Google, and multiple other companies in the Silicon Valley. They hire a lot of foreign students, and what we have seen is that this invaluable talent pool help them to be stronger and they can keep on innovating, and then expanding to create more job opportunities. 

When the talented people (a lot of them are young foreign STEM students) are driven away from America, the center of innovation will also be driven out of America, and the job opportunities are then moved to other countries. During the Great Recession, due to lack of chance/funding, a lot of foreign students went back to their original country (such as China), and a lot of them have done great jobs in terms of scientific research and starting companies. These people and chance should be America's. 

So the question is how do we allow more talented STEM students to stay, in order to keep America as the leader in STEM innovations, and thus the industry will be healthy and competitive and able to expand, to create more jobs for American people.
