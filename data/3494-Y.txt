Andrew Willis Surely the intended purpose of Optional Practical Training is to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned. Hopwever now it seems more often used by foreign students as a way to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. The DHS proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. The hidden rational appears to be that OPTs are significantly cheaper than US workers, 7.65 percent because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. Thus the result of the proposal ( whether intended or unintended) seems to be that American workers will be replaced by cheap imported labor.

Here I agree with Senator Grassley of Iowa who said in his letter to the President: "By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent".

It is not as though there is a shortage of STEM graduates, there is only a shortage of CHEAP stem graduates. Both the IEEE atest to this and the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (in a 2013 study) found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.
