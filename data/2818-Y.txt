I write to support the expanding and improving OPT for STEM foreign students.
Development of high tech is the lifeline of a nation. Right now more than half of the employees in sciences and technology fields are foreign workers. Expansion of OPT provides a better stage for international students with talents and skills to contribute to US. Don't let the talented leave the US.
