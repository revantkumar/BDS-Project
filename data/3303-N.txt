It is counter intuitive to an extreme for the Federal Government to be supporting a program that will unquestionably restrict the job market for American students and allow foreign students greater employment opportunities than students with Citizenship. Especially after the original 'OPT Extension' rule having been vacated~

It is not an acceptable alternative to allow F-1 Students (formally: Non-Immigrants) to challenge the livelihood of Citizens.

Do NOT allow the Corporate Entities to get away with this~

Humbly,
