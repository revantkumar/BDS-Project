I DON'T KNOW WHOSE HAIR-BRAINED IDEA THIS ACTUALLY WAS, BUT IT'S WRONG. AMERICANS ARE SEARCHING FOR JOBS ALREADY AND THESE ILLEGALS COME INTO OUR COUNTRY, TAKE AWAY JOBS FROM PEOPLE ALREADY EMPLOYED, PLUS TAKE JOBS THAT PARENTS LIKE ME HAVE PAID FOR COLLEGE FOR OUR CHILDREN, ONLY TO HAVE THE JOBS THAT THEY HAVE STUDIED TO GET TAKEN AWAY AND GIVEN TO ILLEGALS (THOSE WHO WERE NOT BORN IN THIS COUNTRY). NOT HAVING TO PAY SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES IS A CRIME...DON'T REMEMBER MYSELF HAVING AN OPTION TO NOT PAY THOSE TAXES THAT ARE NOW BARELY SUSTAINING OUR ELDERLY AND RETIRED.WHY DON'T WE ALL VACATE THIS COUNTRY AND GIVE IT TO WHO EVER WANTS TO WRECK IT. MAYBE START OUR COUNTRY ALL OVER AGAIN!!! THIS WHOLE THING IS SICK, SICK, SICK!!! OUR GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK OUT FOR THE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY NOT THE REST OF THE WORLD. GIVE ME A BREAK AND SOME INTELLIGENT HUMAN STOP THIS FARCE...
