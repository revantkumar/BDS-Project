I have friends whom is really excellent and have GPA3.9 who graduate from MBA which is not STEM degree so OPT is too few, now she is hired by Amazon. She had more then 10 times chance to work in big companies like Procter & Gamble but not having the offer simply because the OPT is too short and need working visa to sponsor. Her friend including me pray for her and hope she will have extended OPT and hopefully have chance to contribute her intelligence for United States.
God bless her won't lose the job because of the OPT is too short.
Please, please, please extend OPT and let she have chance to get working visa in time. US will benefit from such excellent Chinese students who graduate from US.
