The latest proposed rule by Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually favors employers over the majority of taxpayers by hiring foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Nothing could be worse for shoring up Social Security. Immigration policy and any reform should serve the interests of American workers, not work against them.
