I want to again use data and facts to explain why Foreign students in STEM contribute a lot to US economy:
1) Based on NAFSA's report(http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/eis2014/USA.pdf), International students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year

2)based on the report(http://immigrationimpact.com/2014/11/19/international-students-add-billions-u-s-economy)

In House Speaker John Boehner's Ohio district alone, 1,528 international students contributed over $56 million to the local economy and supported 837 jobs. And in Sen. Jeff Sessions' home state of Alabama, 7,451 international students contributed around $183 million to the economy and supported 2,064 jobs. Furthermore, international students are particularly important to the U.S. metropolitan areas in which they live and study. Many foreign students come from fast-growing cities in emerging markets and international students can serve as bridges between their home cities and the U.S. cities where they come to study. - See more at: http://immigrationimpact.com/2014/11/19/international-students-add-billions-u-s-economy/#sthash.Mgb2L7iR.dpuf

3)based on http://wenr.wes.org/2015/02/international-student-mobility-trends-2015-an-economic-perspective/
international students are a vital source of enrollments for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fieldsin 2013 more than one in three international students in the U.S. was enrolled in a STEM field. International students also help promote a global learning environment. 

4)based on http://www.nber.org/papers/w11457.pdf, if US does not welcome international students, US global leadership
in STEM will significantly decline:
The Census data show that in 2000, the foreign-born made up 17% of
bachelor's S&E workers, 29% of master's S&E workers, and 38% of the PhD S&E workforce -
huge increases over the comparable proportions in 1990. Indicative of the future, the
