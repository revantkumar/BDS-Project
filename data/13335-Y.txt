What is wrong with you people in congress? You represent Americans, stop screwing us over every chance you get to advance some feel-good agenda! We can't afford to be the Welcome Wagon for the rest of the world, coming here with their hands out. And all the while not even embracing our culture and values, let alone our language. Do your job or step aside for someone who will take pride in our country.
