I support the proposal based on the following reasons:

1. From a perspective of the entire social development, the proposal will make F1 students tend to stay in the US for a longer period of time so thatthey could help to tremendous value for the society and even for the U.S.. F1 students are admitted by the admission office at Universities so the vast majority of them have the skills and they are the talented people. Attracting students to stay doesn't necessarily mean that they will stay in the U.S. for the rest of their life. Their staying in the U.S. actually helps to generate more job opportunities that could address the employment problem (increase the employment rate).

2.The US welcomes the students from all over the world. If the US doesn't welcome them to stay here for a period of time, it just doesn't make any sense. If the US only welcomes someone that sends the money to the US and doesn't allow anyone that hopes to make some money after graduation, it is really impolite and unreasonable. Approve the proposal and show some humanity!

3.If the proposal cannot be approved, it will spell a disaster for most of the tech companies. A considerable number of F1 students are working in the cutting-edge field and they fit the jobs and jobs also fit them. The US government doesn't want to see a disaster because it imposes a negative impact on employment rate.
