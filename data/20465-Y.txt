I strongly support the rule. When I was applying for graduate schools, I considered many countries, including US. The reason for me to choose US in the end is the OPT program and the STEM extension. This program allows me to get more real experience in the industry right after school and hence I would be better when competing in the job hunting process in my home country - China.
It is so shocking to see the rule being vacated and so many people are criticizing with even untrue stories or ideas. We are students, NOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS! We paid more tuition than domestic students, far more than they paid. We pay taxes for our income during OPT, NOT EVEN A PENNY LESS. The only tax or fee we do not pay is the social security part - and that is because we are not taken cared by it as well. We DO NOT take ANY advantage from your social security funding!
Also, all of my foreign classmates and I are hardly taken any opportunities from US citizens with lowering our asking salaries. The reason is extremely simple - the companies are just not operating like this and they are not allowed to do this according to the rules. Nor do we want to do this.
Last but not least: companies are moving abroad with the rule being vacated. This actually does not hurt foreign students, us, so much since they are also offering relocating opportunities for us. JP Morgan is expanding its quant team abroad, for example, and it is not the only company doing this. UK, which with more friendly policy on working Visa, is becoming one of the popular relocating place.
I do hope to have this rule to be passed, since with the above reasons, it does not only help us but also the US education industry and the ability to attracting big companies to stay.
