I think OPT extension for STEM is very beneficial to American industry. More foreign students are willing to obtain a PhD degree than Americans in these majors. While the innovative most come from people with deeper understanding about the field. If those PhD students have the chance to stay in American, even if only for three years, the potential contributions that they may bring is promising. I strongly recommend passing the extension.
