William Smith I would like to speak in favor of continuing the program, particularly for Chinese students with whom I have become in contact as a university teacher. I have taught Chinese students at the undergraduate and graduate level in Beijing and Guangzhou universities for two years. I found them to be dedicated to their studies and work, intelligent, productive, and placing a high value on their family. country and their own integrity. I hope that any changes to the program will not adversely affect those students here in the U.S. for study for the limited time currently allowed. I think their presence benefits the U.S. economy as well as the professional development of the individual student. Sincerely, William H. Smith, PhD, Professor of Foreign Trade, Beijing Union University
