I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. First of all,The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.If America abandon this for some ireational reasons like the anti-immagration organization,it will be a ridiculous loss for the American development.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, as you can figure out,which makes the U.S more conpetitive.And the cancel of the regulation will cause a bad influence in the talents.Just think about thishow many scientists in US make spectacular achievements were international students before?

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing.It won't do harm to the current job markets,for the native Americas are no more enough for the suitable jobs.you should remember what you wanta competitive America.If the government refuse to develop,who would make steps forward?
