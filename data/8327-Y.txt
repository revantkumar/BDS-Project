I strongly agree with an extension of OPT period for STEM students. Our most well-known and profitable companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple, and Intel, etc are supported by a large group of engineers and scientists who used to be international students and obtained the work visas through OPT after graduation. These companies contribute to a large portion of the taxes that we benefit from. United States is a country proudly established and populated by immigrants from all over the world and it is our spirit not, and never to close this amazing land to new immigrants, particularly the ones who can bring value, wealth, and opportunities. International students with high level STEM degrees are definitely a big group of them who directly benefit our industry and research.
