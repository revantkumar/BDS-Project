It is so difficult for graduates to find work in this failed economy. It is al;so difficult to pay back loans for college with the poor jobs available let alone make it difficult for hard working american families to be burdened with taking care of the financial repsonsibilities if loans aren't paid. or illegal immigrants taking immense benefits that we pay for.Please do not make things for difficult for our american graduates by giving out more to those who do not pay into the system and have no skin in the game
