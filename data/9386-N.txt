We have an excess of people who need jobs with and without degrees in the USA that are citizens. We don't and should not take tax payer monies that should go to our own citizens. We should tap into the wealth of knowledge that is here already. People are expected to work till they are 65 and older to collect SS benefits but corps are forcing these older folks out and bringing in workers on visa's and contracting out to temp agencies.
