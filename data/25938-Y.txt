I strongly support this extension. 

keeping talent international STEM students to work for America will contribute to this nation's competence now and future. The recovery of economy needs knowledge and work force, especially, workers with high education in STEM. A large number of STEM students are working for high tech companies in US, they are not doing cheap job there and got well paid. 

This nation invested in many international STEM students for years with scholarships and fellowships, why let them leave without making them valuable to American economy using their knowledge and skills? 

This nation was created by people with dreams and it welcomed people from anywhere of world to make their dreams become true.Why now should Americans stop those smart and hard working students to have their American dreams?

Indeed, this nation needs to secure its broad and regulate illegal immigrants. But students on OPT are not illegal immigrants, they can contribute to this nation and its people in the future!
