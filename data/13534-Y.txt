I personally strongly support the extension of OPT.

First of all, international students account for a large portion of the US school student numbers. They are here to pursue the American dreams and make contributions to the nation and they have somehow already done so. The extension will allow them continue to do what they've been doing.

Secondly, just a short glance at those huge technic companies. Many of the main contributors are from all over the world. Some of the world changing products may not be brought to the world without them. Those progresses not only benefit the US , but the whole world. That's something we all value, isn't it?

Last but not least, the extension does not mean they are taking the positions that are supposed to be taken for Americans, US is an equal opportunity country. There are just not enough citizens having the knowledge to take that responsibility, the way we can hire more international students is to keep us moving and therefore create more positions for more people with that specified knowledge.
