How can anyone object this rule?

Obviously those international students have higher education, stronger techniques than public Americans. Their home country make a lot of efforts to let them go back after graduation. Now they are willing to work for US, why the goverment do not let them stay?

For example, Computer Science, US domestic computer graduate talents are totally inadequate to meet the needs of society. Why would take thoese people away knowing that they are very useful for the country? just because some losers want to have a job?
