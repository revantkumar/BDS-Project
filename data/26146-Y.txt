This extended OPT STEM rule will benefit all the tech companies. You dont want to waste your time on training your employees if they can only stay in US for 1 year. Also, all these students graduate from US universities. They got U.S. education. You dont want to have them back to China working for Chinese companies and beat up Apple or Google right????? Besides, theses guys have big purchase power. The longer they stay here, the more money they will spend.
