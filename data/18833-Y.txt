I strongly support the proposal for a new OPT 24-month extension period. This new extension policy not only apparently benefits the F-1 students who is currently seeking a job or will be in the near future, but also ensures the prosperity, competitiveness, and the continued leadership of U.S. around the globe.

First, the STEM students have proven their competence in almost every field of scientific research, reflecting their competitiveness as high quality working force in the future. Just randomly search the research papers in major scientific publication services like Nature, Science, and PRL for example. It is quite easy to see that a lot of the STEM students, coming from Asia and Europe, are making significant contributions. They have showed their intellectual ability, confidence, and determination in scientific endeavors. Given the new OPT extension period, they could apply what they learned from the universities to the real world and make even more contributions than academic research.

Second, the STEM students have worked for U.S. based companies already, even held very key positions in very famous and prestigious companies like Google and Apple. They boost the innovative power of the respective companies and ensure leading positions of those IT companies worldwide. Just imagine what would happen if they were not able to work in the U.S., but instead work at other counties. The loss of U.S. would become gains in other countries. 

Last, I do agree this new policy may hurt someone to some degree in the short run, but the competition is a good thing and could be beneficial to all in the long run. But if we forsake this proposal and create a barrier to protect local employees, its good for them temporarily but at the expense of future innovation. 

So from the long-term perspective, this proposal would definitely make this country a better one.
