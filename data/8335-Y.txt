Qing Wang The STEM extension is DEFINITELY helpful to the US development. A significant amount of international students graduate every year from US universities, particularly in engineering field, with outstanding performance in academic work. They will continue making contribution in the field they dedicated to, as they have already proved. As a fact, the development of the country's economy desires this force and the demand will never diminish under the competitive market economy. The STEM extension is not only giving these students a chance to get more experience in working in a developed country, but also, more importantly, it provides a precious working resource to the US development. This is a WIN-WIN situation.
