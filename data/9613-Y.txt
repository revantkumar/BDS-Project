I STRONGLY AGREE with the new immigration proposal!
1. The OPT proposed for student with undergraduate or upper education level degree. These students, with smart brains and outstanding knowledge, are the key to our country 's development. Nowadays, it 21th century, the strongest country is the one holds most new technological invention. If we keep these students in our country, they will contribute to our technology development.
2. People argue that if we keep this graduates in our country, the unemployment for citizen will increase. However this is not the case, the OPT extension is only for people work in technologically fields, such as electrical engineering, machical engineering, biomedical engineering....these fields and industries will always need more and more new people, new thoughts and ideas. The majority of the unemployment in our country is those without high educational degree. For these people, if you don't have a job, there is nothing to do with the people with OPT extension.

Overall, I DONT SEE ANY DISADVANTAGES of this OPT extension proposal!
