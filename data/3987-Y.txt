This country became the great nation it has been BECAUSE of immigration. Although I am extremely unhappy and angry about the underhanded ways the indigenous people (with whom I claim blood relationship) were, and continue to be, treated by the then immigrating Europeans/now U.S. citizens, to now treat incoming immigrants as second-class citizens as many ultra-conservatives propose is absolute foolishness and totally inconsistent with the principles of our founding fathers and our own constitution (excluding all of the unlawful amendments that were added after the bill of rights). 

I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities to succeed in the U.S. I would even support accelerated citizenship for those students who would choose to remain in the United States after their education and practice training has been completed.
