I believe it is quite important to all International Students in the U.S., which is also gonna affect the willing of application out of the State in the future. People like us(foreign student), who are willing to come to America and learn from State's education. Because we believe that if we work hard, do effort, contribute what we got to this society, we can get the equivalent payback as we expect. America is a freedom and fairness country known for everyone in the world, which is the primary reason that make us look forward to get into this society. I just think it would be fair if people like us have the same opportunity to contribute what you learn in wherever you want, including stay in the State after graduation. Thank you.
