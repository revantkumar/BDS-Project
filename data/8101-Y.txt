Highly skilled STEM workers are an enormous net benet to the American economy. Their achievements are astounding, especially in relation to their numbers. But the achievements do not just accrue to the STEM workers themselves. The spillover effects of increased technological innovation, entrepreneurship, and high rates of education are enough to safely justify removing all caps and restrictions on OPT and H-1B visas. 

Restrictions on the entry of highly skilled workers hinder the growth of certain industries, reduce economic growth, and slow technological development. The government cannot pick winners among highly skilled immigrants before they enter the country, so the number allowed entry should be as great as possible, the requirements for entry as low as possible, and the burdens eliminated to the greatest extent possible.Certain immigration restrictions should be enforced. Prospective
immigrants who have been convicted of a felony or are suspects in felony cases, suspected or actual members of terrorist organizations, and those who have contracted highly contagious and severe diseases should not be allowed entry.

A nation's immigration policy ought to maximize benets to its citizens. Removing visa restrictions and allowing an unlimited ow of highly skilled immigrants, subject to the few exceptions above, will benet Americans far more than it will cost them.

We support this proposal without any reservations.

Richard Thompson
