I believe the opt extension to 24 months is very important for America and I support the extension. It is high technology that makes America the strongest country in the world and brings affluent and peaceful life to American people. The opt extension doesn't only provide invaluable working experience to STEM students themselves; their intellectual contributions to the high-technology industry will ultimately benefit all Americans. 
And as we all know, America is a nation of immigrants. I simply cannot think of a reason to prevent these hard-working, intelligent international students with high academic qualifications to pursue their American dreams on this great land and contribute to the prosperity and strength of this country!
