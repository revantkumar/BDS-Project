Opt extension is important for United States. U.S. government and taxpayers have paid so much money on training foreigner students. It is not only a waster but help the other countries competing with American, if all those foreigner students are back home. 

Secondly, one of the major work force in scientific research is foreigners, and they suffered from low pay and over-time work just because they want to get a job eventually. If there is no opt extension, they will just quit and go back home. In such way, all scientific research will slow down. If U.S. still want to keep the NO.1 position in the world, such work force is necessary.

Most American comments argue about there have been enough work force for the stem industry. This is maybe true for the entry level job positions. However, for the Ph.D level or Master level positions, there are not. Another argument is on IT area, because indian consulting companies input the indian work force to the U.S. job market. But those work force is mainly come to U.S. by H1B VISA and it has nothing to do with OPT. If American government want to regulate IT job market, please start from those indian consulting companies.
