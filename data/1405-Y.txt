Jiewen Tan I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. Absorbing talents from all over the world is one of the most crucial reasons for the United States to stay energetic and powerful.
2. This policy will attract more international students to American colleges, which brings great economic benefits to the United States.
3. All men are created equal. Let capability be the selection criterion and let us make a healthy job market.
4. As one of the economic engines of the United States, Information & Technology industry relies heavily on F1 STEM students' contributions. In return, it is the continuous contribution of F1 STEM students that constantly keeps the IT industry flourishing.
