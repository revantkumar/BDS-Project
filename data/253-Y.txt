Miao Lin I strongly support this new rule. STEM related job markets is the only place that international students can earn jobs against US citizens. In other industries like law and medical, international students have zero possibility to get a job. So for the diversity and economic reason, I believe OPT extension is good for America. After all, both international students and US citizen need to be interviewed with several rounds during the employee selection. So it's totally fair for everyone. Talented students should not be blocked simply because they can't stay in US.
