I strongly support the extension of OPT because:
1) We should judge people by capacity and talent instead of nationality or race. Many international students with STEM majors do have strong capacity, and this has brought great value to many U.S. companies, institutions, and the whole country. 
2) Extension of OPT will attract more international students to come to the U.S. to study and improve the education quality in the U.S. They bring diverse perspectives which is of great significance for higher education. Also, They are able to pay for the tuition, which is good for the universities that are lack of funding.
3) It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance!!!
