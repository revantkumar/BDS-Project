I strongly support the extension of OPT.

I support to extend OPT to ensure every qualified STEM student who has 
graduated from US universities to contribute to our country. Why should we 
send those good people out?

My coworker, Jing , graduated from University of Maryland, and joined our company. 
She did a great job. She helped us to start a new project on 
health outcome research with her great knowledge in epidemiology area. So we got several full time 
head counts this year and hired several college graduates.

However, she had to stop working because she did not win H1-b lottery 
and ran out of OPT. It is a big loss for our department.

Please help OPT students like her to get a chance to contribute to our 
great country.
