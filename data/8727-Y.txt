I would strongly support this rule. USA is being well established as a free country and elite people from all around the world deserve better chance and welcoming environment from US who thrive to continue to be the strongest and most desiring country in the world. As a country benefits from free economy, US should know that the market demand makes most sense. US can hold the advantage of being the technology/science leader and IT beds, one of the strongest support and necessary factors are elite people. If the US companies, who are the salary payers, choose to pay competible wages to STEM students, there is strong reason behind that. Keep in mind that companies are after profit and they are not international charities. The STEM students are bringing them better ideas, efficiencies, working deliverables and thus profits! As a huge benefit, US is gaining more competitive powers though a bigger tax pie, instead of holding the pie and eat them all. The sustainable way for US citizens to get more jobs is to be more competitive instead of setting limits for new entrees. This will only accelerating diminishing the pie. Let's all together make a better US!
