Mark Wang I strongly supposrt this proposal. Diversity is definitely a indispensable element embedded into the constitutional system of United States. Current international student possess great quantitative and analytical skills that could contribute to the growth of technology, healthcare, business and other sectors tremendously, especially considering that most high-tech industry practitioners have an international background. This proposal will definitely encourage those who are extremely talented and intelligient to continue working for U.S. companies and contributing to the growth of U.S. economy. I don't see any cons passing this proposal both in a national and a company context. Indeed, this proposal have the potential to benefit the states in the long term.
