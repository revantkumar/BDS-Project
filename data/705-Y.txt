Hello Jill,

Our programs are not placing foreign persons over US Citizens, not at all. First of all, international students face many restrictions in college. They are not eligible for work-study, off-campus jobs, or financial aid. In the job market, most employers avoid hiring them due to the expensive sponsorship and filing fees. All these rules are in place to protect US workers and students. Furthermore, if they want to extend their OPT, their employer has to be enrolled in E-Verify. A lot of employers are not in e verify. The international students who can overcome these disadvantages are the best, the brightest. They are the ones that can make the USA continue to be strong and developed. In the short run, it may appear they take some jobs, but in the long run, this country remains developed and rich, which will create more opportunities for everyone in America! So let's support this new rule and make this great country great!

All the best,
