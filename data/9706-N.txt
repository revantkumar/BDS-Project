I strongly oppose the DHS's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students longer and for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over equally or overly qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens!!! Simply put, the OPT program is an easy way for tech companies to recruit cheaper foreign workers at the expense of American Students or workers and STEM students. Please stop this and DO THE RIGHT THING FOR AMERICA!!!
