Xinmeng Wang I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I got my Master of Science degree from Arizona State University this Summer and I am working at a design company now. I have learnt a lot of practical knowledge and new concepts from my co-workers even I just started working one month. Our company spent money and time for my training and they also helped me register a training class next February since they knew that I have extension of my OPT and they hope that I can contribute to their company during my OPT. My opinion is that the companies who hire these current OPT students WILL HAVE HUGE DISASTER if the OPT extension policy is canceled. That means that they spent money and time to train these fresh students, but they do not have enough time to create benefit to these US companies!!

When I was a senior students in China, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the internship training opportunity during school and after graduation. I was wondering if I can get 29 months (1 year + 17 extension) of a internship opportunity, I would get a very good job when I go back to China.Thus, OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents, Without this OPT extension rule, I do not think US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and the students would choose other countries who has better policy to finish their study.
