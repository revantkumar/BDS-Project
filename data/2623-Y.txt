I strongly advocate the proposal to retain and extend the opt extension. Right now US's tech sector is booming, and it has growing demand for qualified people to work or maintain tech products. There is actually no real conflict between us people and foreign students on job because right now there are more jobs opening than people qualified. Also opt extension will only keep those qualified international students not those who aren't competitive enough to get a job. US needs talent students from China and India to keep driving the productivity of silicon valley.
