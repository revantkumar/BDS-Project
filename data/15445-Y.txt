I do support this proposal.

I belive giving international employees a longer time to stay in the U.S. is necessary. They are great workforce for U.S. employers, and the new ideas from different cultures make U.S. more compatible among other countries. 

On the other hand, loosing all F-1 students means a huge decrease in tax for the government, also less demand in housing, food, transportation and so on, which could result to a hard time for the U.S. economy.
