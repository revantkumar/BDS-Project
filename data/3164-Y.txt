OPT extension is from my own concern very useful for STEM students to acquire work experience since they should necessarily need a chance to turn their academic learnings into a practical working experience. These extra working would benefit not only students but also the government for their investment of high-level education. The government could have more well-performed international students to work for them and meanwhile propel its industry. This is a great chance not only for students, but also for the government and surely to be approved.
