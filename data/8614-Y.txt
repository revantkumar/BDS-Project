Dear Mr Johnson,

Hope you are well.

As an international student coming from Istanbul, Turkey and will graduate in December 2015, I am one of the F-1 Visa holders who benefits from the OPT STEM Extension.

I wanted to leave a comment here in order to express my opinion which is in favor with the expansions and improvements to the OPT-STEM program.

I believe these expansions and improvements will not only benefit students with F1 Visas, but the companies who are willing to hire them as well.

First of all, a 24-Month OPT-STEM extension will allow companies to thoroughly evaluate international students before nominating them for the H1-B process. These thorough evaluations will return as efficiency to companies.

Second, competition within the job hunting process will increase, because international students will start applying for non-sponsoring positions as well. Although this might seem to hamper the interest of American students who are on the verge of transfering to the business life, but the rules of economics show that increased competition will ultimately increase productivity and once again efficiency.

Last but not least, many international students who are willing to gain experience after graduating will be satisfied with three years of working experience in the U.S. This might result in lower number of international students applying for a H1-B. This does not only offer a solution to the problem that might arise from the second point made above, but will also work in favor for companies.

I myself am grateful for the attempts being made to extend the STEM program and would like to thank you at the end of my letter even though there is a very high possibility that this will never reach you.

Yours sincerely,

Husnu Yalcin Oney.
