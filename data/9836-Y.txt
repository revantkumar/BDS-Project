I STRONGLY SUPPORT the extention of OPT for the following reason:

1. The OPT extention can attract more and more international student to study here. Think about the huge amount tuition that US get from these student.

2 Some people argue that there will be more and more immigrants taking jobs from us. That is quite stupid. Not all students want to stay here. The OPT is more like a permit for internship for them.

3. Even if some students want to stay, I think they can contribute much more than those illegal immigrant from you know where.
