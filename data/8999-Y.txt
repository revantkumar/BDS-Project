It seems to me that big business is again influencing our government in favor of foreign nationals over our own citizens to help their bottom line. Using foreign STEM students in the OPT program is just away to gain cheap labor at the expense of similarly qualified citizen students who will remain in the US and benefit our own country. The OPT program, aside from taking money out of our country also provides a pathway for foreigners to remain in our country. Immigration is a very sensitive and controversial issue and this program seems to be another way for foreigners to get around our immigration laws. It also seems to me that those STEM students who qualify for the OPT program are most likely from countries that already have a thriving technology industry and will, maybe, be marginally affected by these students when and if they do return to their country. The OPT program should go back to the 12 month period or at most stay at 17 months and not be increased. Part of the qualification for a foreign STEM student should be his/her country of origin. Any student from a country that is already advanced in the technology industry should not be considered.

Thank You
