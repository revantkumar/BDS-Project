I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Their knowledge, especially in Science and Engineering, will benefit our economy greatly. They will make US employers more competitive in global market. And as a result, producing more opportunities for American.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Our nation is built upon incorporating culture and knowledge from people with various backgrounds.
