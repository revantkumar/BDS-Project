I really support to improve and expand OPT because the following reasons:

1. For STEM students, we are valuable to american companies for the development of science and add great values to our company once we are hired. This should not be restricted by region, nation, or race by law. So the OPT STEM extension program will benefit not only STEM students, but all the developing companies.

2. It does not make sense that the OPT extension only grant 17 months period. I have seen so many cases that a STEM students who hasn't got his H1B visa after 2 years, he has to work for about 7 months after April, which will make him feel so sad and disappointed and impact the efficiency of work. Expand the period to 24 months should give those people another chance for H1B visa.

3. There should be a grace period for those whose OPT expire in front of April, if the employer agrees to apply H1B visa for them. 

All in all, this proposal should be approved shortly.
