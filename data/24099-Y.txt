Millions of engineers and scientists graduate from universities of China and India in every year. If US cannot attract as many engineers and scientists as China and India and let them stay, one day it will lose its leadership in the world. Without the OPT extension they will leave and this results in the shift of scientific and technological power. This is not expected by US.
