While I cannot hope to be an expert on all the laws and issues this proposal addresses, I believe that this country is strengthened when we welcome those from abroad who wish to participate in our economy and civil society. 

Especially at a time when there is a widespread demand for STEM-field workers, I cannot imagine why we would not want to avail ourselves of these qualified individuals who want to work here. If we are serious about maintaining our place at the forefront of research and technology in the world, we cannot afford to allow xenophobia to control our policy. 

I am in favor of this proposal, as it will allow students to remain longer, and give them a better chance to find a meaningful place to train and eventually contribute to the workforce, while also putting important protections in place.
