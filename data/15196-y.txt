Bruno Hou Please approve the new rule. OPT-Extension is one of the main reasons that international students would choose to pursue their degrees in U.S. 24-month OPT extension would support them to gain some experience in U.S. We all know learning knowledge from school is important, but hands-on experience is more valuable. The additional 24 month give those students chance to have interns or jobs, even if it is very difficult to find jobs for international students. American employers also can have enough qualified candidates when certain types of workers are in short. It is a win-win situation.

Also International students contribute to the increase of the local economic. They stimulate consumption and help the culture exchange. Please keep the diversity culture which is helpful for the economic and social.
