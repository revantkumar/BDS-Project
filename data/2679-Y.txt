Agree with the proposed rule.

The OPT STEM extension is a necessary rule for both U.S. and international students. It brings the best students from all around the world to this country and let them serve the industry here right after they received their degree from the best education provided by this country.

The whole process is totally based on the demand of the U.S. industry and market. An idea that the U.S. needs talents from all around the world. The U.S. did a real good job having people from different places sharing the same belief and living together for the past two hundred years. An idea that let the country of liberty growing fast and keep leading in different industries. 

This idea shall not perish from this country.
