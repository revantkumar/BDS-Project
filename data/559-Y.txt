I strongly support the rule for the following reason for the following reason.

Two thousand years ago, in China the king of Qin dynasty built the Great Wall, and it leads to the perish of Qin dynasty
Hundreds of years ago, in China Qing dynasty cut off the country from outside world, and it leads to the downfall of Qing dynasty.

Now America's Great Wall is the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that's for the illegal immigration, and Donald Trump might build a Wall, but at the same time america should open a door, a beautiful huge door to foreigner, to the talent foreigner, and the extension to 24 months is exactly such kind of door.

America needs foreigner to come to USA, they are talent, hard-working, and did lots of contribution to this country.
