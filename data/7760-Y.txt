Kris Chen I Strongly support OPT extension with 24 months for STEM international students. 

First, OPT extension policies ensure U.S schools become especially competitive versus other countries(e.g. UK, Canada, Australia), by OPT's allowing international students to apply what they learn to business practice, to gain solid skills and experience before they returning to home countries.

Second, attracted by OPT extension policies, hundreds of thousands international students come to U.S to receive education, contributing to U.S schools, educations and research by paying billions of tuition, and to U.S domestic consumption and economic growth by spending billions on living expenses.

Third, attracted by OPT extension policies, the most talented students from all over the world will prefer come to U.S to contribute to this country's research and development on science and technology sector, which basically has contributed and will contribute to U.S long term competitiveness globally. And 24 months OPT extension will guarantee they have enough time to contribute values to this country. 

Again, I Strongly support OPT extension with 24 months for STEM international students.
