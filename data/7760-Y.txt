I support this proposal. Competition is what makes a nation great. Protectionism only serves to deteriorate. If this proposal doesn't get through because people wanna save american jobs, the US tech industry will gradually lose the edge it currently has, and eventually you will lose more of your tech jobs to other developing countries.
