This is a fantastic idea. The US economy can only benefit from more highly skilled workers in the STEM field. As an engineer myself, I've seen firsthand the value of bringing the best and the brightest to America, where they can add their ideas and diverse perspectives to our industry, and I'm skeptical of the idea that they threaten American jobs. Our country badly needs STEM workers right now, and incentivizing more to come to the US will only grow the industry for the rest of us, perhaps even bringing more high-tech manufacturing jobs back home.
