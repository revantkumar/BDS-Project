I strongly support this proposed rule for following reasons:
1. Nonimmigrant students received the US higher education and they deserve more time in the United States to practice their learned skills after graduation.
2. Although some of the jobs may be taken by F-1 students, this result is under equal competition, which means people who get the jobs are the best for the whole society. More talented students involve in the work will definitely promote the economy.
