I am opposed to the proposed rule change for the OPT program to allow MORE foreign students in to take American citizens jobs. Also I am offended that this program would give incentive's to companies funded by US citizens to deny jobs to Americans!I want to know the following:
1) What study indicated that this program was needed, if there is a study WHO was it funded by? Are they independent, if not WHY?
2) What is the expected cost of this program,who calculated the cost if there have be forecast?
3)What is the impact on American workers, how many will lose jobs as a result of this program? If you have forecast, how was it compiled and who compiled it?
4) Who are the proponents of this program and what proof do they have that there is a need, other than lowering their labor cost at the expense of American workers.
5) What safeguards will be put in place to insure that fraud does not take place and WHO will enforce the rules and WHAT WILL THAT COST? 
At a time when the labor participation rate is the lowest in almost 40 years and we have a RECORD number of Americans not working, that have given up hope that they can get a job this proposal is an insult to every citizen of the US!
I hope for a prompt response to my request for information and would like to see the justification to implement a government funded program to put more American out of work.

Thank you for your attention to this matter
