I come to support the 24-month extension, since from the party of our international students, it is a great opportunity for us to maintain valid status while looking for a job and experiencing the work style in US. On the other hand, more importantly for the US government and the whole community, if the OPT extension was canceled, huge amount of international students working with OPT would have to go back to their home country immediately, which would lead to a huge expense of the US companies who hired them to look for new candidates. As we all know, a lot of high-tech companies hire a lot of international students. If OPT extension was canceled, these companies would have to take large loss in the following year due to the rehiring, which would also be a bad news for the US economy. So I think it is a win-win for both the US government and international students working with OPT to approve the 24-month extension.
