Steven Li I firmly support this rule. 

Wages have grown fast for most STEM-oriented occupations, which is a clear indication of a shortage. From 2000 to 2013, analyzing Bureau of Labor Statistics data and adjusting for inflation, median salaries for workers in computer and mathematical, health care practitioner, engineering, and science occupations rose 8 percent, 7 percent, 6 percent and 5 percent respectively, even as those for the average U.S. worker showed no growth.

Vacancies for STEM jobs are going unfilled in large numbers.Recent report analyzes this phenomenon using a rich database with millions of vacancies posted on company websites compiled by Burning Glass, a labor market analytic firm. 
There are some 40,000 computer science bachelor's degree earners each year but roughly 4 million job vacancies for computer workers. In all, the median duration of advertising for STEM vacancies is more than twice that of those in other fields.

If the rule is not implemented it will send false signal of visa tightening rules globally. Without doubt, the U.S. leads in popularity of STEM programs among globally mobile students. 

The sheer enrollment of international students in STEM fields in the U.S. (300,898) in 2013 is more than the aggregate of that in the UK (111,795), Australia (69,459) and Canada (46,863). 

Please approve this rule.
