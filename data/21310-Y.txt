I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S, there are lot of scientist in U.S. are internationals.
3. Competition will improve the average quality of the employees for the employer. And competition exists everywhere, only those who are not outstanding will be out. So competition is not a bad thing, that will drive people to keep improve themselves and to be stronger.
