Xue Kong International students need this expanded OPT period because 1) we need working experience 2) we paid much more for college education than local students in public schools so we deserve this expanded STEM OPT!! We don't want to take away Americans working opportunity or take resources away from you guys. We need the working experience here so that after going back to our own country, we can find a job!!! We also need the working opportunity so that we at least have a chance to earn money to repay our parents who have funded our study!! Without working experience we can hardly find any jobs in our own country or anywhere else in the world!!
