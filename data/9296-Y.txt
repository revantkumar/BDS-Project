New rule is great! But if STEM OPT could be extended to 36 Months. Then it will ensure that no project will be left in between by a STEM Student. Because most of the projects last for 3 to 4 years. A 36 Months OPT will ensure complete summation of Students' Academic and Practical Career in United States. So, I believe STEM OPT should be extended up to a total of 36 months.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!
