Science and technology was and still will be the most important factor for the U.S. to keep the leader position of the world. If the U.S. close the door to international students and doesn't give them chances to work in the U.S., the U.S is actually harm its own benefit. Because the life conditions in other countries are becoming more and more better, people don't need to stay in abroad to earn money and get a better life. The fact is, more and more Chinese students want to go back to their own country because of the policy in China encourage them and give them nice options and there is no necessary for them to stay in a unfamiliar environment to struggle and earn money and a visual bright future, leaving their parents lonely in their own country. On the other hand, the industry in the U.S. indeed need this students to serve for its academic and industry need. If the local students can support the industry, there will be no influence to the U.S in short time; but they can't actually and there are huge need from the industry. So why the U.S. don't employee the employers which get the training in the U.S. education system? To summary, the U.S. need new blood to keep the power to increase its economy and keep its position in the world. It faces a huge challenge and pressure from the development of other countries and areas, and should do the right option which can bring the long benefit to it. If you review the history of the world, you will find the decrease of the culture power always begin from its closure to the outside of the world, and then it will lose the blood to keep attractive.
