I did not understand why people blame unemployment rate on the OPT policy. I know many talented foreign students who want to gain professional experience after graduation have difficulty finding a job or an internship because of their visa issue, since only a few companies would provide visa sponsorship, and to be honest, they are as excellent as native students. On the other hand, not many college degree holders (US citizens) have problems finding a job as long as they have an average GPA. So it's time to stop blaming the OPT policy! For non-tech jobs, of course, such positions available for international students are even fewer. Imagine how much more effort a foreign student must make to get trained professionally in their fields. We should provide such opportunities for them because this is the reason why US is the greatest country in the world. Equal opportunities for everyone, as long as they are eligible and wiling to contribute!
