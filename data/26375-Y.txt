I strongly support the extension of OPT because the dominating power of the United states is essentially rooted in its leading position in science, technologies and higher education, which has been based on and will be strengthened in the future by attracting the worlds best talent. An extension in the OPT with STEM degrees will certainly reassure the companies, research institutes, universities and other organization moving forward world-leading science and cutting-cutting edge technologies finding qualified and even extraordinary people to maximize their potential and keeping the advantages.
