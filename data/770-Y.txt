It is an indisputable fact that US is advanced in technology and economy compare to the rest of the world and it is also an indisputable fact that immigrants who are holding superior technology knowledge contributed a lot to the prosperity of this country. Extending OPT for F-1 students who hold key knowledge in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics area will absolutely give high motivation to all international students from all around the world. OPT policy gives the hope to immigrants to realize their dream way of living and they WILL work hard for it. As US market is free and competitive, employers have their rights to decide who to hire and who will benefit the most to the company thus the thought of international students are job takers is a pseudo-proposition. In another hand, international students study in the US and occupy educational resources, even the tuition is 3-4 times higher than in-state students. The government is a long term thinker should get benefits after training all these student to build a better, diverse, smart and advanced America which I believe is the foundation of the country. International students in STEM major need a better way to motivate themselves to work harder in order to stay in the US by contributing to the economy. If OPT extension is cancelled, or become shorter than before, loosing people with talent will definitely hurt US technology advantage in long wrong and sort of wasting the good education resources. As reindustrialization is the way to keep US strong, I strongly encourage the government to open more for international students in STEM majors as they are the important labor force to the economy of US. In addition, I would like to ask for improvement in working Visa as well. The way to obtain the working visa should be regulated so that this can be a fair game for everybody.
