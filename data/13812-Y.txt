The US is built by creative, hardworking immigrants who dream big. Not by lazy protesters who just want to secure a job.

I randomly looked on linkedin, google posted a job, within 3 days there are 500 applicants. NASA posted a job, within 2 weeks, there's less than 10 applicants (because only citizens and green card holders can apply). So the problem is not because F1 students take all the jobs, it is because American people are too spoiled to be able to stay competitive. For those jobs that need serious and deep understanding of STEM, there aren't enough qualified US born candidates.

The US is the most industrialized country in this world, to keep the machine going, we need not to limit but to extend the possibilities for F1 student to work for this country.
