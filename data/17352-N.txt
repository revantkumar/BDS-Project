There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers, many of which have been laid off by Disney, United Healthcare, etc. I believe that we should retrain American workers, if needed, not import foreign students. Foreign students can, and sometimes do, take the education and training back to their home countries and the American taxpayer is left holding the bag for it. Please reconsider this decision. Thank you.
