I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. No one can deny that the tuition from international students support the regulation and research work in the university in some extent. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many IEEE fellows are not American-born, it is the DIVERSITY of American society that enable them to pursue a higher degree in American and then make a tremendous contribution to the scientific development in the States.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition is everywhere in the context of the global economy. The competition in the motherland will definitely give students in American a competitive edge when they are engaging international issues, ranging from political issues and business matters. It is beneficial to the whole society.
