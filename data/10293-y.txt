Yu Chen The extension for the OPT is very necessary for STEM degrees and I strongly support this new rule. 

Nowadays, international students are the majority in the STEM degrees. For example, in the Electrical Engineering School in top universities like Stanford, Harvard, Columbia and etc, the ratio of international student in the graduate school is more than 70%. Without doubt that they are the best-trained people in this field and the industry needs these talents to grow. If they don't have extension in OPT, they can only stay here for one year after graduation if they are not selected in the H1b lottery, and have to leave U.S. after that. IT IS NOT A LOST OF THESE PEOPLE, BUT A LOST OF THIS COUNTRY. In the STEM degrees, the number of native students are low. They are far from enough to support this country to hold a leading position in these fields. So the international students in STEM degrees are not going to take the job away from the Americans. On the contrary, they are the best supplement of the labor resources in these field. 

So please pass this rule for the sake of the future for United States.
