I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.. If we look at NYC and Silicon Valley, and other booming places in U.S., there are a great number of US-educated immigrants who are creating and inventing great things every day for the benefit of Americans.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S..We all know that U.S. is an immigrant country, and we take pride of this inclusive culture which in turn attracts talents all over the world. 

3. Competition is not a bad thing. The stupid thing to do is to educate those international students but then force them to go back to their home countries in the fear that these students might create competition to local Americans.
