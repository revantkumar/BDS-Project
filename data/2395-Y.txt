I am an international student from university of Tennessee study computer engineering. I strongly support the OPT STEM 24 month extension to be approved. I think there are so many high-tech companies of US employed a lot international student for internship or full-time jobs. Those high-tech companies is the reason for this prosper, strong and powerful United States. These companies actually need a lot of workers with master or PhD degree to undertake high-tech research and development, while there are so few US citizens are learning STEM compared to the number of studying business. Therefore, it is very important that we international students studying STEM with post-graduation degrees are not taken job opportunities from US citizens, but fill the short of US citizens preference on study. Once the high-tech companies get enough employees on high-tech research and development, this not only makes the technology of US become more strong, but also can bring the economy becomes better and prompt the other related industries get developed, the direct results is the job opportunities will be increased for more people. Just like a strong horse that brings the other horses to run even faster. Without this lead horse (high-tech), the speed of the other horses will slow down as well. Then, the results will not be good for increasing the economy and the job opportunity for the US society. 

Based on the aforementioned reasons, I think the OPT STEM 24 month extension only brings benefits for the US society, and support this rule can be approved.
