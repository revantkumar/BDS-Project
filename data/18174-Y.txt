I strongly support expanding OPT STEM to 24 month.
Since US has invested money to international students for high education, why not take the advantage of it and let them make contribution to the industry? One of the google founder Sergey Brin is Russia-born American who is also an immigrant and created Google which provides thousands of opportunities and thrive the industry for sure. Maybe the next founder of an amazing company is among those international students facing the danger of being kicked away from US.
And the people who think that international student take away job opportunities aren't qualified for these kinds of jobs.
