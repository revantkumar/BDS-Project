This rule benefits not only international students but more importantly the US employers and every single tax payer. For employers, this rule enables them to select the most qualified candidates out of job market based on competency rather than nationality or other concerns. Besides, employers dont have to match the salary to the US citizens or the employees with H1B visa. In other word, the extended OPT allows employers to have more cheap labors and longer time to evaluate these employees before making a long-term investment on them (e.g. sponsoring for H1B visa or green card). Compared to illegal immigrants, these international graduates are paying tax, easing the burden of every tax payer while not having the same benefits as US citizens. At last, please do not forget how this country was formed-from millions of intelligent and diligent immigrants. The over protection of those who are wasting the whole nations wealth can only lead the country to decadency.
