I strongly support this proposed rule cause this is a win-win strategy for both US and international STEM student
First of one, US tech companies is still short of qualified employees, and a lot of international student could be a good supplement. Tech companies could benefit a lot from this new regulation. For international students here, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in class and gain more real-world industry. So this is totatlly a win-win strategy.
