I strongly support the improving and expanding of OPT. However, some of my classmates including me are pursuing a second degree while we have already used up the 12 months OPT. In current rule, we cannot apply for OPT again unless we pursue a higher level degree and we cannot apply for OPT extension which we have not used yet. We think it is unreasonable. As soon as we graduate, we will lost legal status to stay in US. It will be a great loss to US since many of us are experienced engineers and we know in-depth knowledge in different areas. The government should allow the students who are pursuing a second degree and already used up OPT have the opportunity to apply for OPT or use the OPT extension.
