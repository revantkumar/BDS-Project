I studied in U.S. for two years, and really appreciate the high-quality academic education of U.S. University. After graduate, either me or my friends want to apply the knowledge in the industry. The OPT is just 12 months, which is not enough. With the OPT extension, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees can get another 17 months before. Now if we could have the extension of 24 months, that would be really good.

Now this is 21st century, talented people can seek their future with more options. In the science and technology field, U.S. is the leader of the world. I myself, as a master student of EE, am glad to have the opportunity to participate in the training opportunity after graduation. 

I think this is a good thing for the U.S. Firstly, with more relaxed policy, U.S. could attract more talented or experienced people to work for U.S. company, which contribute tax to the government, create treasure to the science and technology. Secondly, U.S. is a democratic country, and the leader of free world. To be honest, as a foreign, I can feel the restriction from the policies. There are many limitation for the foreigners. The OPT time is one of the example.We study as well as other students, and we make our own contribution to U.S. also as well as others. But we just have such a short time now.

I would be glad if the government can really improve and expand the training opportunities for the F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.
