I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. I believe I have my rights to say something about it. 
First, I'd like to say international students and foreign workers are valuable to United States. They are not taking jobs away, instead they working hard to create new jobs for domestic citizens. This matter involved huge amount of economy growth which is vital to United States. If we stop the extension, we may block the economy growth for this country and it will be bad for everyone. 
Second, United States of America has the reputation of freedom and dream. This land will no longer be free and hopeful if we are doing something that may kill others' dream. The extension will benefit international students who may have big contribution to this country. Keeping useful intelligents will definitely remain the leading position of America in the world, in terms of technology, science, medical and everything else. I think it's the best move for everyone if we give longer extension for foreign students in US.
