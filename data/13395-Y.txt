I have been here since college. We learned all Americans classes, even much more hard work than any other American to achieve our goal during college and master program. If we left this country, we not only bring the money, opportunity for business and all your research results and knowledge back to our county!!!! Americans, you don't want friends stay in the US, because you are afraid of us to take all your opportunities because of your laziness!!!
