Zhao Li I strongly SUPPORT the proposal about Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for STEM students for two reasons. One is from the perspective of the interests of the country. The other is for the profit of the companies.
First, the OPT Extension can improve the domestic consumption and economic. Since the education especially the higher education in the U.S. is the most developed in the world, international students are gathering to the U.S. and will keep this trend. So the international STEM students are making much more efforts to the consumption of the country, such as the tourism. Besides the higher tuition for international STEM students is obviously one important positive factor to the consumption. 
Second, the OPT Extension can help build a better high-tech industry. Due to the jobs STEM students can have, the companies sometimes need to pay for the training part. So without the OPT Extension, the companies especially the high-tech companies, would lost the chance to develop from the OPT students. Without the OPT Extension, it would possibly increase the costs of the companies because the students would have to leave this country and the companies pay for nothing. 
And the OPT students will not take over the job opportunities of native Americans. The OPT Extension is only for STEM students and according to the statistics (http://www.ed.gov/stem), the talent markets now are still in the need of STEM students, which means without the OPT Expansion, the talent markets would lack more supplies.
So I SUPPORT the proposal.
