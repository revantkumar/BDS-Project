I support to pass the rules of OPT extension.
After reading the rules and comments, I found there are some misleading information for those who do not know the real situation for OPT.
1, OPT pay the full tax, as I know,if the company submit the correct form, OPT needs to pay the full tax include social security and medicare(which is my case). so there is no change for them to skip tax.
2, someone mentioned DISNEY, the people DISNEY hired actually have no relation with OPT. They deliver the labors directly from foreign country. Actually more than 75% of H1B are used by consulting company which do this kind of thing. so no OPT extension won't bring benefit to create more positions.
3, the people use OPT often have either paid several years tuition or work for professors. they bring more money or contribute high tech for US. it is not good to let the talents go or other case, let the money skip from US. as I know, if there is no OPT extension, US will lose money and jobs instead of get more.
Thank you for reading!
