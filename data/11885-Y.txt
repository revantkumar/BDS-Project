The proposed rule is good to not only F-1 students but United States. With this rule, more legal, well-educated, smart STEM students could work in US. Compared to millions of illegal immigrants, those STEM students could make a lot more contribution to US. Their research and development in science and technology will enhance the economic, technological, military and political leadership of US in the world. US was founded and developed by immigrants so more attraction to foreign talents should be welcomed. If US government could accept so many illegal immigrants, there is no reason to reject the proposed rule.
