I think this rule is OK. 

This OPT thing would authorize foreign students to work in the States. Based on my understanding, everytime a foreigner is employed by a U.S. company, due to the skills and capability she/he brings, average 3 or 4 job opportunities (I forget the actually number, it seems to be more than 3, D.O.L. website should have this info) will be created for U.S. citizens. Another point is a longer OPT would attracts more foreign students coming to U.S. for education, which brings a substantial revenue for a lot of U.S. colleges. 

Yeah, there are indeed many foreign engineers in silicon valley. Maybe someone would think or prefer to acknowledge this as "they are stealling our jobs". However, the fact is, even though Facebook and Google stop recruiting Indians and Chinese, most of our unemployed software engineers still cannot get their positions, because they are not qualified. Yes, we are short for S.T.E.M. talents, this is a truth which everyone knows. If the foreigners getting employed in the States could help the country growing and makes U.S. citizens living better, why stop it?

USA is a country built by immigrants from different country, if those smart foreign young guys got jobs here, some of them might become citizens one day, from which this country would definitely benefit. And that was how this country was built.

To the guys (or programmed bots to copy/paste negative comments on this website) who yield "NONONO" to any immigration reform, are your and your spouse's grandparents native Americans?
