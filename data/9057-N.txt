First an immigrant would be checked to make sure they are not terrist.Two they would be checked for education background, that is how can they add to our country ? Can they support themselves ? NO WELFAIR, food stamps or other benefits should be available to them. NO social security numbers would be issued until full citizen process had been gone through, at least 3 years. Each immigrant , children included would be checked and parents would have to provide smoney for children to attend school, not our taxes. All hospital bills would be paid by immigrants or insurance they purchased. They would not be allowed into this country to be a drag on our economy as that would be very unfair the our citizens . They would have no voting rights until they became citizens and understood the laws of our country would be their laws now and English is spoken language.
