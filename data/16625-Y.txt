This is definitely good for the States, for people, for the economy and for everyone. 

Please ask yourself why we have the biggest market and highest technology in the world? That is because we have talents, engineers, scientists from all over the world. They have large contributions to the country. Today, all over the world, every country has good polices which try to get more talents of other countries to work for them. If we don't use them, they will use them. 

We have the best Universities in the world. However, after they graduated, if we don't employ them, we will lose them and more. Look around, you definitely can see more international students in STEM then American kids. If we don't employ these international students, who will work for us ? 

So let rise our hands and support this ! It is for the States and future.
