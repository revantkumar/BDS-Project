Pavithran CR There is a good reason to extend OPT : Greater exchange of ideas from foriegn students and a better advancement in technological progress. American students do get placed well in the STEM fields and hence there is no way foriegn students are taking away their jobs. 
OPT provides a great chance for our country to assess talent and use it appropriately. It also provides a student with a proper practical training before they go back to their country and start working. I strongly encourage the extension of OPT.
