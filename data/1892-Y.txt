Sridevi Aellala I support expanding the 1 year OPT period including 24 months capgap relief for foreign STEM graduates with F1 visa . Extension of the period of practical training after graduation will do more good than bad to the motto of american immigration system. It would give a chance to the students to gain work experience in the United States, part of which is an inspiring factor for students to travel overseas for higher education. The students should be given considerable amount of time to work in their areas of specialization , before leaving to their home countries. The extended OPT period would allow students to concentrate on working, rather than bother about applying for temporary work visas. Thus the burden on H1 visa applications every year , can be reduced to a great extent. Even though there are many STEM graduates who would look upon ways to stay longer in the US, enabling a total OPT period of 3 years, would entice most of them to leave to their home countries , at the end of OPT. Because by then, their purpose of working in american tech industry would have been solved. This would also result in companies applying for H1 visa sponsorships only for the legitimate and eligible graduates, instead of sending sponsorship petitions for each and every STEM gradute annually. This would finally result in generating more revenue to the american economic system. Hence reform the F1 visa OPT system in such a way that it would benefit everybody involved.
