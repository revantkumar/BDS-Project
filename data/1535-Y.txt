I would strongly support this STEM extension program. 
This program is able to temporarily keep well-educated, talented students in the United States, so that they can contribute to the the economic and social well-being of United States. I can hardly think of any harm of program to the US. 
I want to say that US is an immigration country. Immigrates have contributed, and will continue to contribute into tremendous achievement of the US. If it were not the brave and open-minded Pilgrim who sacrificed their lives to immigrate to US, there were no prosperity of this land at all. Almost everyone on this land is an immigrant, or the offspring of immigrant, so what is the problem of allowing talents to stay? 
It is both selfish and coward for those who use the awkward reason "protecting US-born workers" to oppose this policy. First, the jobs that STEM students have require profound knowledge and exquisite skills on science and technology, that already preclude a lot of US born citizens. Putting in this way, STEM students and US-born citizens are not competing for the same jobs or the same types of jobs. Second, if you are afraid that STEM students may take your opportunity away, be brave to compete with them, study hard to get higher GPA, work harder to earn your own credit. This program could even force the US-born citizens to improve themselves.
