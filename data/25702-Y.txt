I support the OPT Extension for STEM international students. 
Every year, international students spend lots of money on renting apartments, taking meal in restaurants and other aspects, which improves the local economy. Besides, many projects continue more than 12 months. If those international students who participate in the project suddenly has not status to stay in US, the project will be effected seriously. Which means, it is a great loss for those American companies. Therefore, I strongly support the OPT Extension.
