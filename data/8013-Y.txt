I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The U.S. government should let the students who learned knowledge and skills from U.S. universities in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is extremely important for the U.S. to combine varies kinds of power and abilities to be stronger and stronger.

3. If the OPT extension is rejected, a significant negative influence will be generated all over the U.S. and the whole world.
