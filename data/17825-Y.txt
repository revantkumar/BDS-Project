"Americans first" is quite biased. What is American spirit? Freedom and equality. Then the OPT must be expanded to give all of us actual equality of being hired. If Americans, who live in their homeland looking for domestic jobs, can't compete with some young students, who don't have English as native language, who came to U.S. alone not knowing any acquaintances and who have time limit finding jobs, then they are very pathetic. 

In addition, F-1 students can add variety to working groups, giving possibility of comprehensive and better thoughts in work. Expansion of OPT will attract more capable students to U.S., which will give U.S. a further boost.

The bottom line is, equality must prevail over nationalism, and the survival of the fittest.

The expansion must take place.
