As international students, OPT is an important opportunity for us to practice what we have learned in the USA university. The main reasons are as follows: 

1. The OPT extension provides extended time for international students to get familiar with the processing policy and work culture of American companies. 

2. We also have the chances to establish the networks within American companies. All of these would provide benefits to both of international students and American economy. 

3. Those of us, who have obtained and will obtain United State degrees, would be very willing to cooperate with American companies and also know how to cooperate with American companies.
