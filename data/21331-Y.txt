As a international student,when I choose university for graduate degree, I have lots of choice. Universities in countries like UK, Australia, Canada provide high reputation program for international student. However,the most attractive part of american academic is the OPT program which would provide me working experience. If not I could reconsidered my choice.
When I was admitted to universities,I was told to have the chance to work at US for 1 year OPT and 17 months extension. But now when I graduate, it might be canceled, what a fraud!
