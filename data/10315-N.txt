The U.S. currently has thousands of American citizens with higher degrees in the fields of STEM and cannot find jobs. I oppose ANY rule or regulation that further reduces the individuals' opportunity for employment. Why should the U.S. taxpayer fund the cost of "foreigner" training? I understand that said foreign workers are not subject to paying federal income taxes. Yet American workers have to. If the proposed rule becomes in force, once again the U.S. citizen will have to pay the bills and U.S. companies are the ones that benefit.
