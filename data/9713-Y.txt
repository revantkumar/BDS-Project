Thank you so much for reading. I think if this policy can become true, it will really benefit the technology and economy of America. 

I'm a junior in Computer Science in University of Michigan. On the scoreboard of the programming projects of our course, I can always see so many foreign names. They are working really hard to become great engineers. I do not want to imagine that when they get jobs, performing very well in the company, and making many contributions, but suddenly have to leave because of their visa. It will definitely be a loss. 

And as for me and many of my Chinese friends, we plan to go back to China after working in America for years. I really love the things I have learned here and want to show it to people in my hometown. However, the tuition is really expensive. I have to work at America for years to earn the money back. And as we all know, while a person is gaining his salary, he is also creating value for where he work for. It's a win-win condition. 

Sincerely,
Yujin Zhang
