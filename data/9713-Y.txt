Parthasarthy Kannan I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule implemented so that it helps the Highly Skilled and Motivated students in F-1 status, and also benefits the US.

For the Student:
1. Learning to work in a competitive environment and live the dream of pursuing what interests them the most. 
2. Rewarding for the students who have have spent and worked hard in obtaining their degrees.
3. True recognition of talent and the opportunity to be part of a workforce which is filled with equally talented people from all parts of the world.

For U.S.:
1. F-1 Students are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
2. Truly talented and eligible people are chosen to perform a job.
3. Healthy competition, not just in the workplace but also at school-level.
4. With lesser job opportunities the number of students opting for advanced degrees in the U.S. will diminish and point 3 above will not exist, leading to dilution of the knowledge pool.
5. Without OPT extension, U.S. might lose talent to other countries.

In any case, abandoning the policy suddenly will be a huge disaster not only for the students who are currently in the OPT extension period and students who have recently come to the U.S with high hopes, but also for the U.S tech companies who have currently such students working with them. This can create an imbalance in the market and will be unfair to the tech companies as well as students.
