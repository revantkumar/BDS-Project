I strongly support the initiative. It's very ridiculous that most of the negative comments are talking about how international students accept low wage to take the advantage of working in the U.S. and took the job from American citizen's hands. Don't you have even a little logic thinking? 

First, STEM students work in the emerging and most creative industries related to technology, which means the average pay will be surely higher than the pay of other industries. Can anyone find some data that support the "low wage" theory? I don't think they can because it's not existed.

Secondly, no one can take your job from you unless you didn't do well and got fired by your boss. Hard-working STEM students helped increasing the revenue of high-tech industries, which means those company can hire more employees. Not to mention how many positions are newly created by these emerging industries. Besides, people related to these industries can also benefit from it and consume more, which let to the economy increase as a whole.

Actually I can not think of a better deal than having some young talented people pay a extremely high tuition to study in one country and work so hard to contribute to this country for years and then have them back to their own country.

Things are not they seems to be. Think harder and be more logical.
