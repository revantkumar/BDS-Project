It's a good opportunity for native American to learn more about other foreign country's student. Expanding the training opportunity not means it will put the job opportunities of native student in danger because in one hand, it's for those nonimmigrant students, most of them will back to their country after training for a while; on the another hand, now the situation is: most student in STEM degree are nonimmigrant students. there are more and more native Americans don't like to study or work with STEM major, which means if we don't improving or expanding training opportunities for them, we will lose many excellent student who just want to contribute themselves in STEM field in America and we also won't have much reserve of talents in STEM field.
We all know that the STEM fields is relatively the most competitive field of America, if we want to keep our position and let this field developed rapidly, we need those guys from other countries. The reality is cruel so we need those talent people to develop our technology, our economy or something else. We don't need to fear about the competition between our native student and those nonimmigrant students because if they are talent, they can help us; if they are not, after the training opportunities, no matter one year or three years, they will still have no jobs. I believe that American people will never fear challenge, and also only the challenge will make us become stronger.
