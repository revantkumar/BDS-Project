I strongly support this rule.
1. This is U.S., a country that considers equality as its spirit. Students deserves opportunities to practise their skills after graduation, all the students.
2.In some area, especially IT area, foreign people works hard and its contribution should not ever be forgotten.
3. Why U.S. becomes the most strong country in this world? Education and technology. It is the talented people ALL OVER THE WORLD that makes it real. Cut OPT is equal to refuse the best guys in this world to make progress.
