About 4% of students going to universities are international students. They pay an average of 30-40% more for the same college education as their resident counterparts. That adds about $21 billion dollars to the economy every year. Worldwide 18% students choose US, making it one of the top selection for international students. 

Part of the reason why US is the a popular choice for higher education is because it imparts a comprehensive education that includes not just the excellent academic training offered at its great universities but also the practical training attained by practicing those skills in world renowned american organizations. 

Without practical training, the education received will be partial which will degrade US position in the world as a leader for post-graduate studies. Now more than ever we need to maintain our cutting edge on the world stage and attract the top students to study at our universities. 

I fully support the expanding of OPT initiative, to continue being a leader of university level education at the international stage.
