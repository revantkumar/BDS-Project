This proposal should be approved since it is related to U.S. government's commitment, honesty and integrity.

I am a international student who came to US 1 years ago. Before I made my decision to come to US, I have several admission offers with full scholarship from Europe, and I turned them down. The major reason I accepted the offer from US is the OPT and OPT extension policy, with which I can further practice my skills in real industry.

If this policy is canceled, then all my plan and effort will become immediately meaningless, and I will feel fooled by the US government. If I feel this way, how about all the other international students? There is no doubt that the attraction for international students will greatly decrease, which will hurt the US reputation and economy in a lot of aspects.

Thus, I strongly agree that this proposal should be approved with no hesitation.
