Dear Representative of the U.S. People,

Why are you bent on destroying America? The manufacturing sector has moved out of the U.S. and you want to allow more foreign workers? We have many Americans that need work and are educated to do this work. The influx drives down wages, creates safe havens for terrorist and other undesirable elements! NO, enough! Do not shove any more down our throats, we the american people, are fed up with the political agenda you folks are pushing.

Regards,
Larry J. Carr
