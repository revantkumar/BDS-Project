I support this OPT extension program. Skilled foreign researchers and workers which came from OPT programs after graduate have made huge contributions in the research and innovations in nearly all areas in U.S.. International students, including me, may have multiple choices before they select U.S., the OPT program surely was an important reason for us to make our decision. Cancelling the extension and blocking foreign students away is definitely shortsighted, and opposite to the interest of America.
For those worrying concerns, expanding OPT cannot do any harm to the U.S. citizens, as mentioned in the proposal by DHS, the modified proposal asked the employer to follow the new Mentoring and Training Plan to protect U.S. workers from possible employer abuses. Moreover, international students involving in the job market with commensurate opportunities will increase the health competition inside the market, which is always needed for development. 
Also, International students benefit a lot to the local business, as is mentioned in the propose, foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. Spending for living, transportation and housing, they all have great contributions to the business around universities. The cancel of the extension which would lead to the decrease of non-domestic students will definitely give impact to local economy.
