As an international student, I have to say this is super super important for international student to guard our rights. We deserve justice and opportunities to apply what we learnt into practice. I truly support to maintain the opt extension for stem students and prolong the period to benefit our career. In additional, this will benefit all the companies who are looking for highly educated and qualified candidates in specific fields. There is a huge shortage of talents in stem fields currently and I think for the benefit of the country, this is an excellent solution to maintain the brilliant brains. The cap-gap relief is also important to guarantee our freedom in choosing the job we'd like to do. In additional, this policy will help both F-1students as well as the United States in the short term and long term. We just want to do our job and contribute as much as we could without worrying about our status issue. I do think this is the right time to make some good changes!

I trust the government and court to make the right decision. I just want to show my support and hopefully you can hear our voice. Much appreciation to all your time and patience!
