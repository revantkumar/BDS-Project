For me I strongly support this strategy. They are just new graduated students attaining STEM degree. We can offer them chances of better education. Why can't we give them opportunities of better working experience? I find most of you guys worry about losing your jobs. That's ridiculous. We should treat this with a bigger view. One of the reason that we are the US is that we absorb them and they do make contribution for our country, right? And tech companies do need these guys to make creation. It's beneficial for us!
