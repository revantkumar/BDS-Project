The extension of the OPT is valuable to foreign students with advanced degree to gain work experience, no matter they'll stay in USA later or not, and more importantly, it's critical for USA to keep those top brains to serve the state, which in turn will promote the competability of USA and create more downstream jobs. Please consider approving the OPT extension.
