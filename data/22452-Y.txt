Increasing and expanding the training opportunities is a win-win. Increasing opportunities to high-skilled tech workers with advanced degrees is not a zero sum game as it is perceived to be. Expanding and improving opportunities to F1 students with STEM degrees adds more talent to the pool, which benefits both the students, as well as small and large technology businesses, who employ them. This in turn improves the economy. Unemployment percentage in the country has in fact dropped during the time the STEM extension has been in place. 

The premise that high skilled workers are hired because they take lesser wage cannot be substantiated. It wouldn't explain how a majority of immigrant high tech workers occupy top positions as managers, vice-presidents, directors and even CEOs in top technology companies. Expansion of training would provide students with greater opportunities to realize their dream while expanding the talent pool the industry could draw from. Something which has always been a part of the American way of life. Thumbs up for the rule.
