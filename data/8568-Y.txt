Linda Jin To be honest, OPT is one of the most important reasons why so many foreign students choose to study in US instead of Canada or Europe. Especially for those who are doing masters or phds. If only for the courses, save the money and visit coursera. 

First of all, OPT aims at giving F-1 students the opportunity to go to the industry here and get some real life experience. For STEM students, it's so hard to learn something in 1 year. One year is only sufficient for the pre-employment training. Without the extension, why would the companies give those students a chance?

Secondly, having F-1 students working in USA under OPT is beneficial to united states's economy. Those students are in their years of the most creativity. Many of them even start startups to provide more working opportunities for the nation.

Overall, I strongly support this new rule.
