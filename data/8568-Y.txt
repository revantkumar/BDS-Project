This proposal should be passed. If not passed, tech companies will be very hesitate to hire international students because it's hard to tell if the student can get H1B visa for only one chance. Most companies are not willing to provide only one year position to new graduate students since they need cost to train students. For fast growing tech companies, OPT extention is very important, even they do not sponsor H1B, many international students are still willing to join them and this will undoubtedly be a strong force for new startups and the society can benefit much from this.
