The OPT extension is much needed for international students. As a working professional I know the value and benefit of getting work experience in countries like USA. Just studying in US university doesnt improve the career growth. Its the work experience and the amount of exposure to Industry which plays crucial role in growth of individual. When the students are spending heavy amount of money in education they should be given chance to work in OPT which helps build the future of USA as well as individual. I dont see any unacceptable terms in this new rule.
