Excellent set of rules intended to kill exploitation of OPT students. My OPT students are currently pseudo-employed under the pretext of so called software consultancies. These consultancies exploit the loop-holes in the system and lure new OPT students into not learning anything in their masters. Major suggestion would be to prefer higher ranked university (Tier I) students in the STEM extension program. However, the single major problem here is not addressed, please take steps to change the H1B visa process immediately. To save American jobs please limit the number of applications from Indian based IT companies for H1B visas. I beg you to make the H1B application fee non-refundable.
