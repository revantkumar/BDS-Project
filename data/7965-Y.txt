Jasmine Siems I support the proposal with all my heart. Many may argue that these alien employees are taking jobs away from Americans. However, I argue otherwise. The reason you see more foreigners working at a particular company than Americans is because they are more capable at their positions. Companies hire people who are competent, even though this is the case most of the time, certain companies do favor Americans in order to avoid expenses relating to sponsoring work visas and such. However, that's not my point here. I think this should be a wake up call for Americans, instead of looking for excuses elsewhere, it's about it we start bettering ourselves. If we don't like people taking our jobs, it's about time we go to school, put in the hard work, and get that degree. We should work WITH these STEM graduates, we can learn and benefit from them, but not chase them away. Let American go back to the days when the American dream is still in the reach of those who are willing to work hard for it.
