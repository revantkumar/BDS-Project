I strongly support this proposal.
1. United States is a free land and it presents the world its powerful, and its confidence. The open altitude of the United States welcomes the excellent and intelligent people to its country and keeps its prosperity.

2. The expanding OPT are for STEM STEM international students, not for all non-immigrants students! This students will help to fill the need of the high technology companies, stimulate the economy increase of the United States and have more local people get jobs.
