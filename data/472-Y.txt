Expanding OPT from 12 months to 24 months can help companies with either small size or large size to consider more when hiring employees. Most companies think it is limited if the person they want to hire are only able to work for one year period. Because the training process and getting familiar to the working environment can take about half year to a year. If the employee start to become more capable at work but they can not continue working for the company due to one year OPT time, this would cost companies more to train another new employee again, which would do harm to both employee side and employer side.
