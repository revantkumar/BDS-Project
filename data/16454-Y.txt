I strongly support the expansion of OPT for F-1 students with STEM degrees. 

The United States of America is greatest country in the world because of its immigration-friendly nature. Elites, refugees from all over the world immigrated to the US to contribute their talents, making technical advances, to pursue freedom and to fulfill their American dreams. These are what many generates of American people are originated from. The US should be proud of the diversity of there people rather than constraining foreign people to come and contribute. 

Expanding the OPT for F-1 would attract more foreign students to have more practical experience in the US, which on one hand created much tax income, economic growth, advances in sciences and technologies, on the other hand, prevented the exodus highly educated US-trained people. Losing of these talented people would leads to their moving to other countries, which would in turn become competitors of the US STEM academia and industries.
