As a STEM student, I strongly support this new rule for the following reasons:
For the first reason, opt extension has been a attractive policy and because of that, more and more clever people went to The United States instead of other countries for higher education.If this policy was cancelled, it will be a big loss for the education market here.
Secondly, some people blame that the F1 student have taking their jobs. Currently, America has a big market that most of the companies do not have enough qualified workers. The opt extension is for those people who have studied in the U.S universities. They are good educated and capable for working here. And it has been proved that they made a great contribution to the country.
Finally, due to the current H1B lottery system, the tech companies are facing the risks of losing talent employees. But why they continue to hire STEM workers with this kind of risk? Because they need it and those STEM workers bring talent to the company.
In conclusion, the OPT extension is a win-win for both U.S economy and the international students. I strongly support this rule.
