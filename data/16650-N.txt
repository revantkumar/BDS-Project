What the hell is wrong with you government administrators? So, you guys are purposely trying to give foreign nationals preferrential selection over Americans in the US job market simply because foreign nationals will work for less? Never in my life have I seen a president (Obama) and a presidential staff so set on destroying our country and American way of life. Never have I seen a president and a presidential staff that had such un-American attitudes towards Americans. No other country on the planet tries so hard to make life difficult for its own citizens. America is for Americans! Period. You people don't seen to care that an unregulated influx of foreigners dilutes and weakens our country's power. That seems to be what you fools want. The American people are watching you idiots and we're not going to let you destroy our great country (which several politicians don't seem to have any pride in being part of any more).
