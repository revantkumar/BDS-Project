I fully support the new rule DHS proposed. Infact, I would like to request to make it 36 months instead of 24. Please read on to know why. OPT not only help the employers but also the students in many ways. I believe that the current duration of 17 months is not enough to get a complete training in the field the candidate is pursuing. In any field, when a student starts his optional practical training, it will take time for him to understand the complete picture of the company and most importantly in majority of the jobs, employers won't be willing to grant students access to systems and servers worth millions of dollars whereas if the same student spends about two years as a fresher and other two years with full access to everything in a company then that reflects the true meaning of OPT. The student then gets the actual practical training which will surely help him/her in future. OPT itself means practical traning but with the current short duration, the students won't get enough time to learn and do their traning. Hence, I think it's very important to make it 36 months to get the true meaning of OPT. Thank you.
