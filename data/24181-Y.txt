I don't see any reason that this should not be passed.

Using my experience as an example, while I was working for Goldman, I had a US co-worker, who only took IT-related training for 4 month and then he was hired as a software engineer - his work was just an DISASTER. The only reason I can see him to be hired is because he is a native speaker and he can talk. And to be honest, I think any line of his code is just barely usable but not efficient at all - and plus he was hired as an ASSOCIATE but his real contribution was even less than some new-grad analysts. I am not writing this to blame my any single US co-worker or pre-coworkers, while I am just trying to say - even with the current OPT policy, lots of companies cannot hire qualified engineer employees. I cannot imagine if the STEM extension is not passed, how can companies hire enough people to fill the positions - that would not only be a nightmare for any single person but would be one for the whole US who is still in the leading positions for most of the technology fields.
