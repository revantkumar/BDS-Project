I strongly support the OPT Extension proposal. The government should let the students who earned degrees from U.S. universities at least applied their knowledge in the U.S. and make contribution to the U.S. OPT is not only part of education for international students, but also a great opportunity for U.S. companies, especially tech companies to attract great talents. If there is no STEM extension, the U.S. educational institute would attract fewer international students, especially the master's students who usually pay the full tuition. Without these students the educational institutes would lose this portion of tuition that can be used for research purposes etc.
