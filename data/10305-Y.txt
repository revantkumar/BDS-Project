Aditya Tanna I am strongly support the OPT extension rule proposed by DHS. The reason behind my support is, as an internation student, one has done lot of struggle and hard work to earn the degree in United States of Ameraica, and if those people do not get suffient time to earn the accual benifir by working here in USA then what is the benifit of one's coming to USA and obtain Degree. 
Even industry need smart skills who has better knowledge of technology, we are the profession with the degree and knowledge. If this rule has been waived off, then even the economy and grow of the industry will be effected. That's why I support the extension for OPT.
