The proposed rule should not be implemented. The rule expands the import of STEM skills when there is underemployment in these skills among the American population. Further, allowing importation of these skills without a corresponding requirement for the businesses that employee such businesses to develop skills in the American workforce ensures that these skills will not be developed among the American workforce. Additional labor in these categories exists in sufficient numbers among the current populace. Importing additional labor will only depress wages and opportunities for Americans.
