Yang Zhou I think the OPT extension is very important to the US society, in which helps keeping the top people with high technology from all over the world in the US. And this will definitely benefits the whole US society as well as US people. Since we know nowadays, F-1 students could work with OPT after they graduate, in areas where local people do not want to work or require higher salary. As a result, the OPT extension indeed help the US companies, especially those high-tech companies, to function properly in a favorable manner.

AGAIN, I AM IN FAVOR OF THIS PROPOSAL!
