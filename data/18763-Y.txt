I support this rule without any reservation, the reasons are as follows:
1. STEM students have been a irreplaceable source of science and technology elites in United States, disprove of this rule will reduce the chance of their employment and thus have a negative impact on technology and economy development in US.
2. If this rule is approved, in the long term, it will attract more talented foreigners to US for study and work, which is beneficial for US economy.
3. US has been well known as a country of freedom, a country trying to give people equal chances. The approval of this rule will give the talented foreign students more chances to practice their skills after graduation.
