Anthony Karasinski I don't want to increase any of the H-b visas because of what's happening at Disney and other companies. Disney forced their current employees that were to be laid off to train their replacements in order to get their severance pay. As if this wasn't a big slap to their faces, they were under the scrutiny of video cams to make sure they were training the replacements properly. If they made a mistake they were denied their severance pay. This happened to loyal Disney employees who were just given raises and/or promotions who had 10-20 years of service at the whim of their CEO and board of directors. Disney isn't the only one either and it's a disturbing trend that needs to be snuffed out.
