I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. Everyone deserves equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.
2. From Economic view, if employers can hire or can find qualified American Citizens to do a job, they would prefer to hire them. The fact now is that many of the employer can't find enough qualified US Citizens to fill in job positions. This is the essential reason why we need foreign students to work in those position temporarily so employers can have more time to locate qualified employees.
3. Longer OPT Time can help students gain more practical experience, which will encourage more foreign students come and study in U.S. And this will help develop education in US.
