I support the ruling proposed by DHS for the following reasons:
1) By extending OPT periods for OPT students, more foreign students will be attracted to pursue STEM degrees in US. This is a great opportunity for the higher education industry. By contrast, if the education industry falls, many people working in schools, nearby restaurants, landlords will lose their income.

2) Foreign STEM students are mostly top students in their countries, therefore, they are a great source of talents for US economy. Foreign students have to work much harder than American students to get the same degree, and only a few of them can make it to US due to limited applications accepted. Why won't anyone want to retain these talents?

3) Many people object this ruling because it creates more competition in the job market. They forgot that they were once immigrants from somewhere else. The arrival of immigrants makes US the most developed country in the world, not the contrary. Competition actually benefits the entire country as a whole: competition helped Microsoft, INTEL, Google and Apple become successful multinational corporations, most of whose earnings are made overseas. If no competition was allowed at the first place, how can US companies defeat companies in the rest of the world?

Hope the people objecting this ruling think from the standpoint of the majority.
