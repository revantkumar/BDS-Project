The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.
At a time when American workers are struggling to get and keep jobs that pay a living wage this program is a bad idea, as it will give employers not incentive to hire American workers. If corporations can avoid having to pay payroll taxes and wages equal to the American industry Standard they will. We instead need to be finding incentives to hire American workers. I fwe must give them incentives and breaks lets give them incentives to hire American not Foreign Students into these computer and stem based jobs. This will lead to a long term solution to US joblessness and help stabilize our society security system, as both workers and corporations would then be contributing to our own economic growth and stability.
