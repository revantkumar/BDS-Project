I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. United States of America is a country known as the melting pot. The ability to attract different talents with different backgrounds is exactly the reason that makes this a strong nation. Everyone enjoys the same right and equal job opportunities under the Constitution. 
2. The future is all about technology. It's good for the US economy to have talented foreign people working in this area. The longer they stay, the better they will be able to help to build this country.
3. With the extension, this will attract more talented international students into the the school which helps the education system.
