I am thoroughly disgusted with the Obama Administration's subverting immigration law and circumventing Congress.
This newest OPT end run is outrageous! Obama gives mouth-service to creating jobs for American workers but in reality he is more concerned about the welfare of foreign students, not to mention illegal aliens.

It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.

This administration's policies regarding immigration are despicable...Shame on you all !!
