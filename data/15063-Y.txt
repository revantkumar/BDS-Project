I fully support this proposal. Allowing F-1 non-immigrant students to work in the US for training purposes is quite necessary for many reasons.
1. For students, working experience in a foreign country is one of the major qualities that make a student a more preferable candidate employee when they start to find a job after they return to their home country. More students being hired means higher reputation US education receives and this will for sure attracts more international students coming to US to study.
2. This helps the US enterprises find more talents to work for them, which boosts their strength in global competition with other foreign companies. This also results in more job opportunities.
