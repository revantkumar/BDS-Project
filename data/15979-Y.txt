I definitely support this rule. I think the people against this rule are shortsighted. Every year thousands of excellent international students get scholarship and study in US universities and colleges. US sponsor their study and teach them knowledge, finally just let them go away? 

During Word War II, US accepted many Germany refuges, many of them are scientists, engineers and skilled workers. Their contribution is one of the major reasons of US blossom.

So I think US government should have a grand vision on this.
