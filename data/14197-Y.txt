In order to gain a whole perspective of product development as an engineering student, I believe a 36 months period of STEM Extn. is more appropriate so that the aspiring student can gain experience for the product development from its cradle to grave and understands the whole life cycle of product development. In addition 36 months is the most usual minimum average period kept for product development in most engineering industries - esp. like Automotive and heavy industries. Prior experience gained through Curricular Practical Training are generally piecemealed and the one gained during OPT deals with settling down in a newer environment while completing graduation formalities at school.
Further, as not too many employers in US are registered in E-Verification program, either of the two steps should be taken. Either it is made mandatory to make all employers who are ready to employ above certain no. on employees or based on the industry they served be E-Verified or the limitation for an individual who is on STEM extn., to be employed by E-Verified employer needs to removed.
Since the STEM period also prepares the individual as how the work-life balance would be if the individual decides to carry on working for the same institution with an approved H1B application, during the STEM period, the individual should be allowed to visit places overseas including his/her home country and be able to return to US even without a visa stamping in order to have family time during the designated vacation periods.
This 36 month or 24 month STEM extensions should be made available to all students in F1 visa who are currently on their existing 17 months STEM.
