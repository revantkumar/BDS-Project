Dear officers:

I'm strongly in favor of the OPT extension program because of the following reason:
1. In support of this program could mitigate the H1B capping issue immediately and allow international employers to better perform on their duties; with 24 months duration, plus the 12 month, they could have in total 36 months to practice and learn, 
besides, it does increase diversity in the company, after all, the amount of foreign employees is much less than natives. For example, in my department, entry level actuaries who carries the valuation work usually would spend 1 or 2 years to get start and familiar with daily work, due to the complexity of regulations and products; hence, 36 months would be a great period to let them know and improve the process, even get do more deeper researches, as well as breakthrough in methodology or modeling work;

2. Many comments say stem jobs should only be prepared for Americans, I really understand why people have such emotions and motive; however, I think number of American STEM graduates does not match the job market gap. The university I graduated from, every US actuarial US graduate ended up with good jobs, like Aon, AIG, etc. while insurance companies still hire additional internationals to fill in their need. That's not say we as internationals are taking jobs from US citizen, It's simply due to the shortage of supply. By the way, many big insurance player on the market does not provide immigrant support for internationals, like New York Life, Geico, Lincoln Financial and so on, which means they only hire US graduates; therefore, job market is never a fair competition from the starting point; 

3. One of the person who strongly opposed to OPT program with a PhD degree probably never noticed that only 11.6% of doctoral degrees was earned by all internationals by 2015(a study from National Center for Education Statistics), which proves again that internationals are the minority at first place, not to mention steal jobs from
