I highly support this proposal.

A country who wants to be competitive in technology needs talents, and the more the better. We know that US can be a leader in many technology industries mainly due to the great talents it attracts, and has been welcome to and generous to talents from different fields and different countries. Looking back into history, there are too many example that great persons with great achievements in different fields are foreigners, such as Albert Einstein.

Those foreign students who come to US for study have already proven themselves to be in top level of their peers. After receiving the great education in US, it's their time to contributing back to the world. Giving them the chance and time to work in US can make benefits to themselves and also to US. They are great talent resources and of great potential, who will be the core driven force in the technology industries.

Thus, I highly in favor of this proposal and hope related authorities can see the benefits US can get from those great talents.
