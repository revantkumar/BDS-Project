In most cases, the US public has financed the post-graduate education of these foreign students. Given that investment by the US public and the need for greater numbers of STEM professionals with post-graduate STEM degrees, we should be "rolling out the red carpet" for these people. We cannot make them stay in the US after completing their education, but we should make doing so as easy and attractive as possible. This initiative is a move in the "right" direction that will avoid sending greater numbers of these US-educated STEM professionals with post-graduate degrees back to their countries of origin, largely China, where they would compete with us based on the much better post graduate education they received in the US (at US expense) than they would have received in their home country.
