Daqian Li If you look at how many foreign workers stands behind the technology/scientific advances in the US, you would agree that a longer extension is beneficial for this country. Let's not forget how the US became the country it is now. Without all the foreign scientists/technicians immigrated after the World War II, the US wouldn't have made much progress in its researches, and we certainly do not want to see that momentum being put down.
