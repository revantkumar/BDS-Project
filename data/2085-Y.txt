I strongly support this rule with the following reasons. 
1. The rapid technology development of America highly relays on the talent from all over the world not only on the US citizens. The US economy will benefit from the talented foreign people in IT fields.
2. US already spend a lot of money and energy to train talent people from all over the world, it's a great pity and lose for US to force the talent people to go back to their home country and make contribution to their home countries development, especially in the highly competitive IT fields. 
3. There is far less enough technicians in IT fields besides US citizens. In addition, most of the US citizens do not prefer to work in IT fields because of the high work load. On the other hand, foreign works have their own advantages, such as multicultural and multilingual capability, which is highly preferred in multinational companies.
