I strongly support this rule, this rule is not only benefits international students but also the great America's economy. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area, only the top talented people have the opportunity to work here, it is a really important human resource. Moreover, it is good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in the US, that is also helpful for the America's economy. If you think about it, this rule is really benefits the US.
