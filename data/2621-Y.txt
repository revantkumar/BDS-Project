Wenran Chen I SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason.
As an employee of a local automotive supplier company, I noticed that my company has faced the problem of finding enough qualified new engineers in the past few years. It seems that nowadays most american students tend to pursuit jobs in IT or electronics industries after they graduate from colleges as they can get paid more. Now it's getting harder and harder for traditional manufacturing industries, such as automotive suppliers to find new blood. This year my company starts to hire international students and they did excellent jobs. I believe this new OPT role will definitely help our traditional industries remain competitive.
