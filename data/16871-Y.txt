I believe the 24 month STEM OPT extension would benefit the F-1 students as well as the employers who are seeking candidates to fill positions in the roles that require STEM training.

The STEM program will promote diversity within firms, reduce turnover rate among international hires, increase employee engagement among these hires, among many benefits. 

The success of such extension could be potentially measured through an analysis of firms performance and individual employees' performance.
