I strongly support this rule with the following reason.
1 Everyone in USA have American have American dream. The most importiant thing in this dream is hard working in a equal condition.This is why some many talented students come to usa. and this rule will give more time to contribution to the usa.
2 That will give a lot of benefits to the usa. That role will make more students come to usa other than other countries and also provide a lots profession(STEM) person in the usa. which will make the usa economy good.
3 That will improve the quality the education in the usa. 

All above make me think I strongly support this rule.
