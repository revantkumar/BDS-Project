Tom Wang The OPT extension is an excellent rule. This rule brings more benefit than impact to United States and US people. The foreign students can bring huge tax income to the government every year. Longer OPT period can make more tax to US. Federal and states can improve our facilities with the tax income from these foreign students, e.g. better financial support for seniors and disabilities, improve the elementary education and make better communities.

The foreign students cannot harm American workers. Companies would hire all American workers in related fields at the best effort, however, there is still a great gap between American workers and actual need. It is very common that companies cannot hire sufficient American workers but can receive many resume from foreign students. This indicates the STEM foreign students can perfectly fill this gap, and US companies can get more fortune to better support American workers.

I support this rule because it is benefit for US. In addition, I suggest DHS to make new rule about how to change the STEM majors based on American work force market, so American workers cannot be impact by STEM rule.
