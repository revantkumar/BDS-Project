United States is built upon technologies. How could an American search on Google, share thoughts on Facebook, shop on Amazon, or use the high-tech Apple products? It is because so many international technologists build these companies up. 

How could so many American financial companies make so much money on Wall Street? How could an American enjoy so many financial services? One main reason is so many international mathematicians and quants build up a lot of cutting-edge financial models and provide system support for the banking system. 

International students, especially STEM students, has made a great contribution to the American economy. They also paid a great amount of tuition for US universities. Without these students, US education system would suffer a much tighter financial budget. Should this happen, it would be hard for US to have such advanced education system, and continue to be the lead in technology and science in the world any more. 

In history, American is a land for immigrants, and is built up by immigrants. Anyone who can contribute should be able to live on this continent. 

I support the extension of OPT.
