I think that expanding OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees will be a win-win, not only for the student but also for the employers in the US. From where I stand, firstly, international work experiences can enhance business tie with USA when I come back to my motherland country, On the other hand, working or creating a startup in my OPT duration is highly likely to bring about more job opportunities to American.
