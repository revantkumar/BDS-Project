YES, SURE, I AGREE! The job market always choose americans first since they are cheaper and can for sure work in the company as long as they can, only when there's no american wants the job or no american fits the job, the companies would consider international guys, who actually fill the gap for our americans. This rule, if applied, would help those international guys to stay and keep the gaps filled.
