I have been waiting for further notice regarding OPT extension for a while. What surprise me the most is that my company is even more concerned about the result. Because there are a lot of fresh graduate who works in our company comes from a foreign country. There three people in my group and it takes me nearly one year to learn about everything and gradually take over more work, my company is worried that if I have to leave my work because of work authorization, it will cause difficulty to the operation in our team. And it is the same situation for a lot of my co-workers in the same company. So I absolutely support the decision of extending OPT to 24 month, not only for my own concern, but also for the normal operation of the company and the country.
