I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.

2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in the high technology area. We all know that the main driven and the reason for US being the biggest economy body in the world is due to its high technology industry success. This success can't be done without all these foreign high educated students. The failure of pass this rule will have a huge shock to the high technology industry. Without their employees, they will not be able to create anything! 

3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US. This is the reason that make me chose US over the other countries. The amount of foreign students also helped many Universities to growing and expending. The students also bring a huge demand to local area around the universities. 

4. It's non sense to say foreign students are taking away Americans' jobs. Because most of the jobs that foreign students taken are higher education required. Which most of the current non-employed Americans don't qualify.
