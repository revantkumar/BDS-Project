Vivian Song I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. We all know that it's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. Hiring shouldn't not be biased according to people's race. That's the foundation of America. This shouldn't be forgot anytime when government make decision.
2. I thank my university and my professor for their education and training. American universities have spend so much effort on educating us. Working in American is the time this country is paid off. We contribute our talents and effort to United States to make this country a better place to live. We are hired means that we are the most suitable person for the positions. We are the ones the could this country better. 
3. I am currently working at a tech company. I like to work with my coworkers. Internationally students can bring unlimited benefits to the team. Diversity makes us think better and work better.
4. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented international students. At the same time, we pay a huge amount of money as tuition which is a very important way for university to raise money.
Thanks for your time to read my comments.
