I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. Three reasons are worthy of mentioning.

1. The U.S. should let the international students majoring in a STEM subject stay longer in the country as this can boost the technological and economic development of the U.S. e.g. IT. The science and technology is the key to the further advancement of the U.S economy which benefits everyone of Americans. So in order for the future economy, we should allow those students holding F-1 visa stay longer.

2. The diversity of the society is very important. Diversity of cultures can also prevent biased or partial collective opinions and behaviors in this country. 

3. Some argue that those international students create intense competition for jobs in the U.S. In fact, this is a good thing in a long run. The competition can push the majority of our citizens to enhance and increase their skills and can give our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. If our domestic companies are no longer able to compete with foreign companies hiring more talented workers who once studied in our country and eventually lose global market share, then our domestic industries will be severely impacted and unemployment rate of citizens will go even higher.
