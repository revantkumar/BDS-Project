Please do not expand the OPT program. There are already about 10 million Americans with STEM degrees not working in their specialties, many of whom would return to those fields with appropriate incentives. Plus, there are already over 125,000 workers in OPT programs and over a half million potential foreign workers with F-1 visas, yet Americans who graduate are finding a stagnant job market in STEM fields.
Sincerely,
John Hildebrand
