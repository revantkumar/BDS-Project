I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. 

For US companies which are using the international students, they need their talent and skills.
With these students based on STEM degree, those companies could grow much faster and contribute huge amounts of TAX. And this TAX would eventually benefit each US citizens. 
For international students, they have leant a lot from universities. Among them, a lot of students have scholarships, which are from government fundings, to support their studies.
It is important to give them good opportunities to contribute to USA. 

Some comments from people who against this proposed extension rule are quite similar: US citizens could loss their jobs in all the industries. This is nonsense. First, this proposed rule only benefits international employees have STEM degree. Second, US tech companies need them badly because there are not so many skilled US citizens qualify these positions. Actually, US tech companies prefer US citizens once they have same skills. They don't need to sponsor US citizens. But for international students , these companies have to spend resources to sponsor them in order to let them work legally.

For people who are afraid that they lose job position because of immigrants, why not learning about some skills instead of complaining? Come on
Those companies would definitely hire you because you qualify the job positions not because YOU ARE US CITIZEN.
