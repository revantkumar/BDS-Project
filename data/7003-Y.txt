Jason Chiu I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal. Extending the OPT will not only brings more opportunities to foreign students, but also bring more benefits to us. Many foreign students come to our country to launch their further studies. Extending the OPT will gives them more time to get trained in our industries. This will help them to be a qualified worker under our culture environment, which, in turn, will bring us with more labors with higher quality. This will promote the development of our industries. Meanwhile, since more qualified labors are available, the industries will have more choices. This will make our industries more competitive. What's more, foreign students will stimulate the consumption in local areas. Extending the OPT will help to promote the development of our economy. There are so many benefits to support this proposal. I really think that the extension is a good thing.
