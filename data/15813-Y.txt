I strongly SUPPORT this new opt extension policy.

Some native Americans are worried about us international students stealing American jobs. Well, I don't think they have to worry about this at all. First, the proposed rule only benefits international employees who attained their STEM degree in US. And OPT extension only allows them to work in tech industry. Working in any other industry will be illegal and they will get deported if they get caught. Second, it was because US citizens cannot fill in the void in the US tech industry that international student can come in. US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill set and capability because they can work here without any restrictions whereas international students need sponsor from those tech companies. And those tech companies is risking potential loss of those international employees because of the H1B lottery system. So, why would they choose international employees if they have to face those troubles?

The strong power of international students in STEM degree boost the economy of US by contributing a huge amount in tech industry. I can confidently say that they even creat more jobs for Americans indirectly. Because high tech industry need to manufacturing their product. Moreover, we need a place to stay if we work in US, thus we rent from local apartment, more house managers and maintenance people needed, or even more apartments and house needed! 

It's definitely a win-win!
