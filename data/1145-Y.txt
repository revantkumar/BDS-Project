I STRONGLY AGREE to expand the STEM extension. 

First of all, this new rule will attract more foreign students to come to US to study, which will contribute more US Economy.

Second, IT/Engineering industries are needing talented foreign people. STEM extension provides them a chance to hire those people and let them create values for US companies.

Besides, foreign students would bring diversified culture to universities/companies, which has a good impact on making a innovative environment.
