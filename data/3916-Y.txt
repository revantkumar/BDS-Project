The proposed policy is long overdue and should be implemented asap. Many scholars have pointed out that while low skill immigration does slightly increase the competition of low skill jobs, the high skill immigration actually creates jobs and boost tax revenues. Therefore, we should NOT try to kick out the talented and bright international students upon their graduation.

I sincerely hope USCIS have the courage to stand up to the xenophobia noise that is generated by the anti-immigration hate groups, which are demonstrated in some of the comments here. The majority of Americans don't agree with their xenophobia and nativism views. While I'm opposed to illegal immigration, I strongly believe qualified international students should be given the opportunities to contribute to our society and make a better life here. After all this is a nation of immigrants.
