Abhijith Rajiv I completely support the proposed law of 24 months of STEM OPT extension. I am an international student pursuing a graduate degree in the US. Myself and I am sure most of the other international students are passionate about what we study and strive to use that knowledge and skill to help improve the life of the people around us, which are the people of USA. I do not want to take away jobs from current American citizens. I support the law for two reasons. Firstly I believe that the Labor Condition Application (LCA) that needs to be acquired before an immigrant can apply for an H1b work visa, does protect American citizens from immigrants taking away their jobs. It ensures that the employer can choose whom to employ only on the basis of skill level. Secondly from personal experience I have seen that companies sometimes have job openings which they don't offer to non-residents. And a lot of times they are not able to find people to fill these openings. Offering such opportunities to immigrant students would only help technology development in the US. I believe this law doesn't give any unfair advantage to students but only encourages everyone to be doing what they are best at.
