Rufus Ingram When will the government start putting the needs of our own citizens ahead of the needs of foreigners? our universities already give preferences to foreigners, even though these same universities are funded with our tax money. Upon graduation, our grads will have to compete with people who have been given advantages though programs such as this one, which is nothing more than another excuse to flood our country with unreasonable amounts of foreigners. We didn't ask for these people to be here, we didn't vote for them to be here, and we sure as hell don't want to be forced to take them in here. These programs show that our government cares less about us than it does catering to the whims of certain business, who want an endless supply of cheap labor regardless of the cost to our nation and it's people. I strongly suggest this government stop trying to circumvent the will of the people, or we will put a stop to this government.
