Steve Farling Stop giving away American jobs the rules already in place are what we would like to keep! I am tired of all the meddling with every aspect to pump up immegrents rights over natural born citizens! My vote is to do away with Homeland Security because you are using up more resources for things you have no business trying to manipulate. Homeland Security should be for protecting our Boarders PERIOD!!!!! Keep all foreigners out of our Country for a while. Absolutely no Musslems allowed in our country and all of them presently here should be deported or detained in the empty FEMA CAMPS!!!!
