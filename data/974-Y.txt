I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. The reasons are as follows:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from US. universities keep making contributions to the US. The OPT is one of the feature to attract elite students all over the world to come to the US and contribute to US. For STEM, the projects usually last for 2-3 years, thus an OPT extension is crucial. 

2. Diversity is very important for the US. Many notable people came to US as international students and began their career in US. Their great contributions in later years are undoubted, which keep US the leading role in technology, science, economy and all. Thus it is a privilege and opportunity to keep diversity for the US society. 

3. Competition does exist, and it promotes motivations and evolution. 
As it is the well known rule, no more words need to explain this. 

4. Many IT companies are now hiring people on OPT or OPT extension status at important positions. If these people need leave US soon, how can the companies survive? If many companies got affected by this rule, no double the economy will be heavily affected. Would it bring in another crisis? No one want to see that.
