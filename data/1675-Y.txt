I support this proposal.

This proposal will benefit not only the international students but also the local labor and the economy in the US.

We can think from an opposite perspective. If there is no OPT and OPT-extension, what will happen?

In short term, maybe the local candidates can better jobs. But there will be fewer and fewer students or other immigrants who want to come to the US. The US will lose a lot. And less investment will be invested in the US market. Then the economy, the education, the technology and science will fall back. After that, there will be much less job opportunities than there are now. Another economy crisis will take place.

So support this proposal, it's not hurting your benefits. It is actually protecting the US. And there is enough regulations for the companies who want hire international candidates than local candidates.
