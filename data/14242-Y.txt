I have looked at the proposed rule for Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With
STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I do not see where this is in any way an advantage to any 
American citizen other than to further line the pockets of high level officials of large corporations at the expense of the average
American citizen. I do no understand either where this has anything to do with immigration and Customs Enforcement. How
does this relate to the enforcement of existing immigration laws? How does this pertain to Homeland Security in any way?
I highly question whether this was drafted by a citizen of the United States. Sounds more like it came from a foreign camp. 
But then again, what is new. Most everything I have seen our government do in recent years sounds totally and completely 
un-American. When is our government going to start serving the people it is supposed to serve. Enough is enough. I have 
five grandchildren and the oldest is starting college next year. They are all looking at technical careers and you are already 
filling positions which they will have to compete for with foreign nationals and the playing field is far from level. The foreigners 
have a huge advantage as the cost to the employer will be much less. I will do whatever I can to inform the voting public I 
know concerning this and will make sure the name of every elected politician who supports this in any way has their name 
attached to any and all information I will continuously be putting out.
