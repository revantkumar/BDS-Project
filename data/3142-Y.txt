There is a huge contradict between the need in the STEM area and the immigration regulation. Companies are under great pressure when they are sponsoring H1-B. In this case, in order to help industry to have more U.S. institutes trained professionals without invest lots of resources on immigration, the extended OPT is the best shot I can imagine.

Previous 12 months OPT is helpful. However, for most professionals, a minimum 6 months training is definitely needed for new graduates. After that, there are only 6 months for employers to decide sponsor or not.

With this 24 months extension, employers can have more time frame to further evaluate employee's talent and ability. Also, as a win-win design, new graduates can achieve more training and employer can get more value for the training they provided.
