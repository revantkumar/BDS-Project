I strongly support 24 month OPT Extension.

This is a very important and a crucial step for the people who aspire to achieve a good technical knowledge, by studying in the Universities in this country.

it would help the students who gain a good practical exposure by working in this country apart from studying.

I wish this rule of 24 month OPT Extension comes to act, and make the united states a place to achieve valuable knowledge for all students.
