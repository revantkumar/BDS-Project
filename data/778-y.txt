Laura Gutman It is an outrage that the current administration is siding with foreign workers at the expense of US citizen workers. This rule would encourage companies to fire US citizens in order to hire cheaper foreign-citizen workers. Favoring foreigners over our own citizens who are in need of employment, is a pattern of this administration. I urge you to refuse to fund or implement this hostile rule.
