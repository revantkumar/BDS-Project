I support expanding the OPT program for students with a STEM degree. America invested in these brilliant young people and America should let them use their expertise to help American businesses. The advantages of hire those stem degree international students are obvious. It helps to promote the development of the company and the expansion of the market. When economy gets better, they will hire more people. This propose will not increase the pressure for Americans finding a job. Instead it gives brilliant students an opportunity and gives companies more talents.
