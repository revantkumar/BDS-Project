Hope Zhang I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:
Without practical training the education for 17 months will not prove to be beneficial to the students
Students will leave US, in the middle of their practical training with half-baked experience, if the OPT stem is not for a minimum of 3 years
It takes a total period of 4 years to master the field experience of stem ( like IT experience without 4 years of practical experience is not preferred by an employer).OPT Stem extension should be for 24 months
Welcome the new proposals (Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan),which will benefit both employer and students. But this should not be a burden with lot of paper work and the procedure should be simplified by online submissions
The OPT Stem Extension Formal Training Program and Customized mentoring procedure and training rule should be simplified for the benefit of small employers as well and should reduce the unnecessary documentation work
Cap-Gap Relief is an Important Part of the 2008 Rule and should be retained
Welcome the new proposals and without this the students will leave the US and there will be brain drain and students will be losing the touch on the Stem degree advancements and experience
It will make a dent in the student career and resume, if the Cap-Gap is Relief is not retained
Anyhow, if they are selected in H1b, they have to come back and work after 6 months. If this relief is there, it will avoid unnecessary travel and unnecessary lack of continuity in employment
