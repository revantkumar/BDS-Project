I STRONGLY SUPPORT this new OPT rule! To those opponent, ARE YOU IDIOT? Do you know how much money those high-tech company will have to spend to recruit and train new students if we lose most of these STEM foreign students? As for competing with US students, most of american students are in other area, such as business or art, so there isn't much competition. Definitely support this rule!
