I STRONGLY SUPPORT the 24-Months OPT-EXTENSION. And I have something to say:
1. OPT-Extension can not only benefit United States but also can help International Students gain more working experience.
2. For people who say the government should not extend or even kill this program, I have questions for you:
What is the point if US deports all the international students and young engineers who want to contribute to this Country with STEM degrees after educating them for years?
Why should US lock down its job market and employers spend a huge amount of their budgets training domestic people in order to qualify the jobs?(For domestic students who have a STEM degree and nice GPA, I have not seen any trouble for them to find jobs)
3. For those US Citizens who have a "Foreign" Last name and are against this proposal. It would be ironic if you find out that your parents or grandparents went through the same difficulties to study/work/stay here before you were born here and became a US Citizen. Ouch, Awkward! Shame on you!
As international students, we are obliged to file tax even if we are just students at school having no income. We are obliged to pay the tax for every single paycheck we get from our internship. We are and we will be gladly pay the tax in US. The point is we obey the law and follow the rule in US. Why would you consider us as ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS? We are 100% LEGAL here as students and this proposal is for F-1 NON-IMMIGRANT Students! 
Lastly, to whom it may concern, please don't forget what makes United States "United States"! 
Thank you for your time!
