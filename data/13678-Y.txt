I am from China. I gained my Ph.D degree this April and found a job in a biotech company in August. During my graduate study, I have been trained with a technology called protein array which not many people know it or know how to do it. Working in the company, I have the opportunity to broaden my understanding and application of protein arrays. I am paying tax ever since I came to US and continues paying tax while working. My OPT will end in next May. I really hope OPT extension could give me additional time to get better training and learn more in a biotech company which would help me have better career development when I go back to China.It will be great new if OPT extension is valid and the extension could give me additional 24 months since my husband is in the last two years of his Ph.D study. Without OPT extension, my family could be separated if I have to go back to my home country. So, I really hope the new rule for OPT extension could be passed.
