Chiranjeevi Srikar Jagu I strongly support OPT Extension, I feel it is very important for an international student so that he can implement his knowledge and skills acquired from his Master's or other equivalent programs and to have training opportunities in the united states of america.

International students work hard to complete and acquire their degree, This extension gives us a fair chance to work and be an asset to many International and Multinational companies across the United States.
