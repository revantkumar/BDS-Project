I strongly support this proposed rule. On the one hand, this rule benefits the U.S..

First, the highly educated international students can apply their expertise in science, technology, engineering and mathematics field to help the U.S. stronger. From history, it is bringing talented people to this country that let this country become what it is today. Imagine what would this country be without those talented foreigners coming here?

Second, the more time international students work in the U.S., the more benefits it can bring to this country. For example, highly educated international students can apply their expertise to help companies' business, hence to help increase the U.S. government's taxes income and the country's economy.

On the other hand, this rule does not hurt Americans.

First, there are much less American college students studying STEM. Sometimes, it is much less likely to find an American student with specific tech skills to do a specific job than to find an international student to do that.

Second, international students studying STEM help this country's economy. Those getting stipend from school are most Ph.D. students. They pay income taxes to the government. Those Master students coming to study STEM are supported by themselves, and they pay tuition, in hence help this country's economy.

Third, international students are not cheap labor. When they are hired, their wage must be greater than or equal to the prevailing wage in that city and area. So, it is not because international students are cheaper to hire than American students, but sometimes they have specific skills that companies are looking for. Without those skilled international students, tech companies will lose a great power to grow and in hence less profit to make, and the country's economy will be damaged.

From all above, this proposed rule not only will not hurt this country, but it will help make this country great.
