I think extending the OPT period by 24 months will benefit the High-tech companies in America. When high-tech companies recruit new employees, they need to train them, which takes a lot of time and resources. When new employees are international students, if they can only stay for a short time period because of the short OPT period, the time and resources will be wasted.
