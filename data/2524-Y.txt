Matt Taylor I read most of the proposed rule and fully support it since it's good for not only the international students who study in our country but, more importantly, the American people as well.

Most of the opposing comments mention the fear that these foreigners will take away our jobs, which is addressed in the proposed rule by increasing regulations of students on OPT program. I also see no reason not to keep these talented young work force in our country for longer.
