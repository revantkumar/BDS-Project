I would certainly like to support the extension of OPT for STEM students. They are largely well trained and educated, and are readily able to make contributions for this country. There is no point to spend so much money to train them and let them back to develop their own countries unless they really want. They are outstanding people and they should have more time to realize their American dreams in this country and bring more opportunities for other Americans.
