I strongly support this extension. My reply to some common nonsense is as follows: 
(1) STEM students help this country create jobs rather than taking jobs aways from American people. The current tech industry is built by immigrants with advanced skills.

(2) STEM students trained in America would not drive the salary down. These is not any research indicating that the STEM students trained in America having a significantly lower salary than their America born classmates. Those having lower wages are H1B workers from outsourcing companies.

(3) STEM students on OPT don't "steal" money from the social security fund, as they don't enjoy any benefit from this fund.
