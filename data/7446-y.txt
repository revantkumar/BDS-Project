Vimal Bhaya The 24 months extension of OPT will help USA retain talented intellectuals and maintain its supremacy as .technology leader. With growing avenues in their home countries, students have tonne of opportunities back home and USA needs to ensure that they give enough opportunities to consider America as a long term objective and build companies here, generate jobs.

It can easily be seen that tech jobs pay a lot , consequently, these OPT students spend a lot on food, housing, cars, etc that ultimately results in lot of jobs being created.

Most of big companies - Nvidia, Tesla have been started by immigrants. We need to keep showing USA as the key leader in technology. This will ensure that there are lot of further primary and secondary jobs created. Efficient implementation of above rule will ensure that growing companies have enough technical talent to proliferate in competitive world. I whole heatedly support this rule getting implemented and respect President Obama for fixing immigration system.

I can understand opposition from few people who say immigrants eat jobs - that's so not true. Growing companies want to hire the best candidate while hiring. They do not care or as required by law make any discrimination.

Passing this rule is very important to maintain America's role as leader in the world.
