As master graduate in STEM, I learnt a series of advanced courses and a variety of methods and techniques in my major. It would a pity that I don't have a chance to apply them to make a contribution to the industry in US.
As an employee, I work hard and keep absobing practical knowledge. It would be a lost for my employers if I cannot stay in US.
As an international student wit American dream, I keep believing it's the best about America that everyone who works hard for his dream deserves a chance. And opt is the chance and valuable time period for international students and also for thousands and thousands of employers and the whole country as well.
