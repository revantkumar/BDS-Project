The OPT STEM will greatly enhance the competitiveness of US education system. With it, US colleges and graduate schools will have more advantages over universities in other countries, like UK, Canada, EU, Australia. It will help US attract the most excellent international students and give them opportunities to work after graduation. These outstanding students in STEM areas will benefit US society, in a varieties of ways, a lot.
