As a International students, I strongly support to expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students, and here are some reasons to illustrate why this policy is important to America.
1.When some foreign students who study STEM have some internship in America like me, it's not only to earn the money, but it's also bring something new to the filed, I think it's the most important thing in the contemporary society, it's creative! It's by the thousands of the students who worked in this filed can support.
2.The foreign students work in America, it's win-win situation. For the students, the basis is work in America has a higher salary than their motherland. And for the America it's more. First of all, the foreign students work in America, it's a supplement of labor force, it's a good way to control the cost. Secondly, this kind of behavior can motivate the local American to work harder. The last but not the least is it's a easy way to develop the local economy.
3.Expanding the OPT can attract more International students, it's mean more technology talents swarm into America, it's can enhance the whole human quality.
4.This policy can be a sign of anti-discrimination, it's also a kind of American spirit. 
According above reasons, I believe prolong the OPT is necessary to America, and it's will bring great benefits.
