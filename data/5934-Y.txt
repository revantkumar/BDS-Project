Dannie D If there is no OPT, I believe more and more US citizens and residents will have better life and jobs. Because many OPT holders they are not as better as US citizens,but they got jobs. I believe if companies hire more citizens, it is better for companies to grow up and contribute to US government, because citizens have better culture fit and environment adjustment. And No OPT means US gives more opportunities to its own citizens and residents, which will encourage citizens work hard and support their country. This will benefit US economics a lot.
