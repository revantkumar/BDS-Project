Sir, with all due respect, I don't agree with you. The foundation of our country is not whether you are US citizens or not. It's whether you have American Dream. Everyone should accept challenges when they step in the job market. Behind every struggling face will be a more prosperous USA future. On the other hand, more challenges means more momentum, which is also a positive signal to every US citizen's career. I don't think that without any hardness and challenges can be a fortune to a young man's future.
