I SUPPORT this OPT extension rule. 

As we know America is very much dependent on High-Tech companies. And those companies need foreign students. With only 12 month OPT, new graduates are very likely to fail visa application, which poses a huge disadvantage to them at the time of job finding. Eventually, many talented highly educated foreign students will be forced to go back and lose the chance to make contributions to america. 

I have read about people whining about they cannot find job because of OPT. It is hilarious that real americans blame others for their own failure. Those people totally missed the point that they DO have HUGE advantage over foreign competitors. 

If this rule fails to pass, it will be sending a wrong message: too hard to become a legal immigrant, why not try be illegal. What US government should do is to control those illegal immigrants

Hope those in power may think this. Thanks!
