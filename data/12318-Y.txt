Dear Officers,

Thank you for your time to read my comment. Let me start to give you a little bit of introduction of myself. I came to USA three years ago because my husband is a phD student here. I did not plan to work here at first and the reason I came here is to take care of my husband, so he could do better on his own study. However, I found that Americans love learning new stuff and always talked about starting a dream is never too late after I lived here for three years. Besides, many of my American friends encouraged me to apply for a new master degree and tried to find a job in America after. Therefore, I did apply for a master program and got admission.

I got to say, I love the university here. The professors are very nice and I learned a lot of professional skills and other fun stuff about American culture. I truly believe what I have learned is going to make America and Americans better in the future, not in a very huge way, but definitely make this country better.

So I think the extension of OPT to 24 months or even longer is necessary and the best thing for America, which is a great way for America attracting more professionals to stay here. People go to work and their hard efforts will yield some valuable results for ordinary Americans, which is a win-win.

In the end, thank you again for reading my comment and have a great day.
