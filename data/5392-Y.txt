Firstly, I have to say expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees is good for both of the USA companies and international students! Within the expanding training opportunity time, lots of STEM degree students will work for hundreds of American companies. They bring benefit for the companies and at the same time it's a good thing for the American's economic progress! Students can get more industry experience and provide American companies with workload and intelligence.

On the other hand, expanding training opportunities for F-1 students also means that study in the US is more attractive. More and more students will come to the US to get there degree because they know they can get more experience after their degree. In this case, American universities will be more attractive to international students compare with European universities. And this also can bring more money expense in the US.

In conclusion, expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degree is necessary for both the US and the students.
