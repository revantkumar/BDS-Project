Why can't we foreigners get the chance to stay in us longer as legal workers? We start our new life here, and we met our friends during the time we study at here. And most of us paid a lot of money for the tuitions and life spending which is way more than in our own countries. What we want is just stay here longer and in some point of view, we want to prove the skills we get from university can help us earn some money to pay the debt we use in US. Is this so non reasonable?
