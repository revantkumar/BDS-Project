Sam Ocean I will support this extension. Some people are worried that foreign students are taking citizens' jobs. This idea could not be more wrong. Smart people would know that America actually really needs more people working in areas of STEM. Even if we force the STEM students to go back to their country, people without jobs still cannot work in STEM areas because they are not trained for it. Jobs in STEM and labor-intensive jobs are different things. And people should not make the mistake of mixing them together.
