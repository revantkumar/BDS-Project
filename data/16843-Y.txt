As a Chinese student, I strongly support this regulation and urge it should be put into effect as soon as possible. One of my main reason to choose this country for my study is that this is a free country. I have the freedom the choose what I want to do after my graduation. Now you told me I have to return right back to my country after I finish my study here? I can't believe this would be a decision by a free country. It's kind of discrimination of all the foreign students. Because you are a foreign students, you can only spend money in this country and get out of our way once you want to find a job here. By the way, most of our Chinese students didn't want to stay permanently here, we just want to get some working experience and returned back to our Country. So extended the OPT for us. By the way, the stem means the majors that few american students are studying. Why so many Americans believe that we are competing with their jobs? These majors means less americans are studying, so the government encourage foreign students to study.
