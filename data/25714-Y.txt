As an engineering working in Bay Area, I can't imagine the shock to the IT industry if the opt extension was cancelled. Most of the experienced engineer currently working here used their opt in the first year after graduation, then in the next 17 months, most of them could get legal identity, and make contribution to the industry further. If the opt extension was cancelled, most of them will not able to work for their current company, this will be a disaster to the company hiring foreign employees, especailly the high tech company, which could including 30% foreign employees. The opt extension should be kept, to contribute to the development of both employees and employers.
