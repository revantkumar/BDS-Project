Shanshan Jiang I totally agree that the OPT extension is necessary. 1> International students study in U.S, the U.S government should give them the chances to work here, but the limited time can not let them do their best on their job. 2> The U.S is the country of immigration, OPT extension will attract high tech people to come U.S, because it is one of the benefit for them. International students pay a amount of money for their tuition, which promote the economic development in U.S. If the U.S rejects the OPT extension, the U.S will lose many money even high tech people. 3> I do not think the international students will hurt the local people to find the job. If the native people have the ability, they will find the good job. But ,in my mind, the native do not have the language issues, and they do not have status issues, they still have hard time to find job, which means they do not have the ability. I want to know that the U.S government wants this situation?
So I totally agree that the OPT extension is necessary.
