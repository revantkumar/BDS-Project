I support this OPT extension policy.
Because STEM student don't have large amount but all of them comes from high tech area.What they are doing has a big impact and brings more change of tech revolution. If this policy get denied, a lot of execellent student might consider go to another country rather than U.S to finish their master or phd.It is a big loss. And every year, F1 student don't occupy a lot oppotunity from local people.Because most of them are creatively,and most of them forcus on certain area. And this is the American dream,isn't is?
