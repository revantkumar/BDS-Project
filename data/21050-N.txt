Why are we giving immigrants a free ride in America? This is not how our founding father's saw our country and most American's think if an immigrant comes to America that they find their own job and support themselves. This is a Free Country but at a price that Americans must pay for immigrants. Stop the bleeding of Americans now of their Social Security that is so easily given to immigrants but American cannot get it without a fight!
