I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Students will not learn English for nothing. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.. It is also when they can make a difference because of the better education in the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. How can all these kind of international students do anything when they have to leave right after graduation? It is the people across nationalities that make the U.S. the U.S..

3. Competition does exist, but how do we improve and make it a better world without competition. It is not a threat to have international students live for a little more period as natives do have advantages in seeking a job.

Hope more people support this proposal.
