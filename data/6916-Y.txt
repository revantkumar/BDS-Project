I support this proposed legislation for its long-term effect of propelling American economy. F-1 students are trained with high skills in America's best educational institutions. The current uplifting American economy needs these skills and talents badly to sustain and fuel its taking-off. Moreover, these students often come to the U.S. to gain the most advanced skills and training in the forefront in many fields. These skills and talents are also pivotal for America to keep its leading position in terms of technology and economy in the world. Why would we training these students with high skills and send them back to build other countries? In summary, I support the proposed legislation and keep the talents in America.
