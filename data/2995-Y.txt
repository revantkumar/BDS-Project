YU SUN If OPT extended to 3 years, there will attract more foreign students to study STEM majors in America, I first choose to come to the USA instead of England to study abroad because of its OPT policy. Although I can study a university with much a better rank in England than the USA.

The OPT extension won't change the opportunity for America local people to find a job. Because it is only applied for STEM majors which is shortage in employees in America. If it is extended to 3 years, there will offer top-quality labour for the united state.

Moreover, the extension of OPT to 3 yea cars show the pardon of the USA, which makes the rapid growth of economy in the USA.
