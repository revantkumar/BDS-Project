Truman Breithaupt Immigration laws and policy should work in favor of American workers, not against them.
The Obama administration operates on the exact opposite premise, that immigration laws
are passed to work to the detriment of American workers, and is demonstrating their support
of this premise by proposing expansion of employment benefits to foreign students in the
Optional Practical Training program. This is being done despite the fact that the Government
Accountability Office says OPT is susceptible to abuse and requires serious additional oversight.

In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, Senator Chuck Grassley wrote,
"The proposed new regulations, while still being internally discussed, are irresponsible and
dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office report issued in March 2014 finding
that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not
adequately overseeing it."

This expansion of OPT would decrease job opportunities for American citizens. OPT should be
terminated, NOT expanded.
