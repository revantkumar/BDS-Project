The United States cannot be a great country if she closes her door as what the Eastern Bloc and D.P.R.K. do. Someone has claimed that the international students would compete with the U.S. citizens and take job opportunities from them. It is definitely incorrect. We can easily find that, those great foreign geniuses have made great contributions to build a strong and progressive America. With the help from A. Einstein and E. Fermi, who came from Germany and Italy respectively, the U.S. developed the nuclear weapons and rescues billions from the tyranny of the fascists. With the work of W. von Braun, a native German, America successfully sent astronauts to the moon and defeated the Soviet empire in the Space Race. Even in the contemporary society, most of American people enjoys the advanced techniques in iPhones and MacBooks, and many of them can earn their own bread from industries related to these astonishing devices, thanks to the great ideas from Steve Jobs, a descendant of Syrian immigrants. Obviously, it is not true that allowing well-educated foreign people to work in the United States will reduce the job opportunities for those American citizens. On the contrary, it will promote the technology advance of this country and create more job positions for everyone.

If she decides to closes her door and refuses those foreign geniuses, the United States will betray the ideals of her founding fathers. In the past hundreds of year, enormous skilled immigrants came to this country from the religious and political persecutions in the Old World. They came here with ideas and knowledge, and finally transformed this once barren and uninhabited land to the technical and military leader in this planet. If the U.S. wants to keep her leading role in the international society, it should continue her open policy, unlike her threatening competitors, and let those international students to know and spread the American values.
