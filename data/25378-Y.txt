I strongly support this Rule of expanding OPT for F1 Students in US. And all I can see from this rule are tons of advantages it can bring to both the US and students themselves.

First of all, students form other countries choose US to study not only for its latest technologies or modern teaching concepts, but also for the opportunities to work after graduation. Naturally, if the duration of OPT is reduced to only 12 months, it remains uncertain whether US will still rank high in students list.

As DHS says DHS is taking this action to include a STEM OPT extension as part of the OPT program under the F-1 nonimmigrant classification in order to better ensure, among other important national interests, that the U.S. academic sector can remain competitive globally.

From this point of view, enabling continued extended OPT for qualifying students with experience in STEM fields is consistent with DHS's Study in the States initiative.

Many companies in US are trying to enlarge their market, and China for example, is their top choice.
Who knows China best? of course, Chines students, and they are going to be the mainstay of China.

U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries.

There are many more reasons,such as significant contributions to local economy, more diversity,ect.

In all, this rule should never be objected.
