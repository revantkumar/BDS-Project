I think this proposed law would be a good step in the right direction. I have met many international students while studying at Georgia Tech, and I think that providing additional opportunity to use the education they gained in the US and contribute to our economy would be a very good thing! This STEM area needs more people in the US to contribute and work in these areas and giving additional opportunities to these talented students would further enhance our economy.
