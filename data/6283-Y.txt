Eric Greene International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. International students have become integral to the financial health of many US higher education institutions, but the impact goes beyond money spent on tuition fees and living expenses. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century.
