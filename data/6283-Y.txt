I support the extension of OPT program, which will provide international student with a deeper understanding in their field. This opt program will never take the opportunity for US citizens' job opportunities since all the companies that are accepting international applicants are e-verified, which indicated an equal opportunity for any races and any genders without any discrimination. Therefore, I support this extension plan, and I also think this should also apply to the students without STEM majors for the same reason.
