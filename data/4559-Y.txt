It is extremely unwise to cancel the opt extension for international students. OPT extension allows those students who work very hard at U.S. to have opportunities to put what they have learned into practice and make contributions. This is the time to allow these smart individuals to create enormous amount of value to the U.S. economy and society.

I have many friends who are international students at STEM majors. They are all polite, intelligent, respectful and hard-working. They devote their time and energy to learning necessary skills and knowledge, they deserve to have a chance to give something back.
