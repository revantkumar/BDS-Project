I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. This proposal should be approved because STEM students staying in the U.S. can provide more diversity for the society. The more diverse the people are, the more creative progress they can make.

2. This proposal will better the competition and efficiency in workforce, seeing that F-1 visa students are given more chance to involve in competition. As a result of the training opportunities provided, not only the F-1 students, but the entire workforce will be more likely to gain improvement in quality.
