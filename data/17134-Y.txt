I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. Many famous people were international student of America before they made a big contribution to America.

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. international students are not rob the job position from US citizens. It is because those position can not find a suitable US citizen. 

So PlEASE don't cancel the proposal because it is good for both US citizens and international students!
