This is a long-pending move and I appreciate that it is finally going ahead. Students with advanced degrees are an asset to us, and greatly contribute to the economy. We need to attract more students pursuing advanced degrees and adding to our economy and hopefully, this is a step in the right direction.

I'm in the tech industry and we find it hard to find American born talent. There is a lack of good, research oriented, problem-solving engineers. The people who disagree do not realize that a lot of engineering tasks have become automated, or easier as time has gone by, and are being outsourced or are just not needed anymore. The OPT extension does not address this at all. It ensures that for the tech jobs that are still here, and will probably not go anywhere since they need the expertise and infrastructure that can only be found here, stays here. I've seen students with patents working at startups here, struggling to get an H1B while shuttling between China and India. It's a painful procedure, and really discourages talented students to stay here, who we ought to retain, after spending resources on educating them.

America is great because of it's immigrants. Because we get the top notch talent from the world. If they stop coming here, we'll stop innovating, we'll stop growing, we'll just die down in a slow spiral of needless consumerism.
