I strongly support the regulation regarding "expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and CapGap relief for all eligible F-1 Students".

America needs foreigners. Well trained, diversified and good quality foreigners help build the country by bringing incredible value to lots of top companies and high-tech and important fields.

America is the most powerful country in the world so America must absorb the most talanted people. To expand the OPT extension length help USA keep benefit from those foreign students.

Again, I fully support this new regulation.
