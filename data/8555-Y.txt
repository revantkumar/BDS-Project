Yijun Liu From my perspective, U.S. public is hard to accept the OPT extension mainly because of its abuse.But I think there should be common ground as US should retain talented foreign students while preventing such abuse from certain companies.
Therefore I suggest the new OPT rule should be improved by these steps:
1) set up a black list of companies that abuse OPT and H1b, those in black list will be forever forbidden from using OPT or H1b program.
2) very clear and high enough prevailing wage requirement for employers to recruit students on OPT
3)OPT program should only be available for students from US universities ranking top 100, the current provision "accredited Universities" is too vague.
