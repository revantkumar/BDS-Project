Opposed to President Obama push to expand foreign worker visas. This is the USA, we graduate fully capable students to be able to fulfill the jobs necessary.
I stand up for the graduates of the USA. 

Foreign students need to stay in their country to origin to making their homelands as fruitful as the USA. Isnt that wonderful for them and for us.
