As a international student applying to graduate study in US next year, I strongly support the proposal:
1. A great number of students who are from Asian countries (e.g. China, India) and studying in US do not have a rich family. A common family in these countries is hard to afford all tuition for a student. But we still have dreams to pursue better education and more knowledge. It is difficult to apply H1B visa if F1 students don't have enough time to stay in US. If we don't have a chance to work and experience in US after graduation, it is such a pity and a big lose to not only ourselves but also our family.
2. The proposal also helps students who are prepare to study in US to make this decision. It must encourage more prospective students to apply the prestigious universities.
3. US is known as a country promoting fair education. If the proposal is passed, US can be a good example to other countries.
