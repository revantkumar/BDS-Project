I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule. America is an immigration country and welcomes skillful people all over the world. OPT extension rule helps this country to attract outstanding international students to utilize their talents and abilities to build the country even better. It'll be a great pity for the whole country to lose its diversity and democracy if the OPT extension cancelled.
