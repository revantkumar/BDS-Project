I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month extension of STEM OPT. There are several reasons that support my argument.
1. The students majoring in a STEM subject who learn advance knowledge can make contribution to the country. U.S should think of a way to make them stay rather than let them go to their original country. Because they may contribute the knowledge to their country which would be a big lose for U.S. A country could be continuously boost the technological and economic development depends on talent people. Those people are in the international students. 2. Competition is not a bad thing. If everyone knows about it and start work harder and learn harder. The country can benefit more. From the other side, citizens already have more advantages than international students, such as the advance education and language advantage and etc. Those competition also can increase citizen's competition spirit which can improve them.
