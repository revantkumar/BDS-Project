I think the OPT policy can bring to the American government as well as American citizens far more benefits than disadvantages and I strongly support it.

Admittedly, there exists competition among international students and the American citizens, but taken second thought, we may realize that the students from all over the world are making great contributions to the American's development in almost all fields. This development will bring more opportunities and expand the job market. Competition remains as a good motivate to push forward the whole community and won't have any bad influences on the American and International students who want to apply what they have learnt to the industry.
