Yu Liang I definitely support the rule of STEM OPT extension for foreigner students.

1. Millions of foreigner students coming to US for high level education contribute to the economy recovery of United State in such a remarkable degree. However, international students have no the equal right to choose where to develop their career freely, which shows the selfless of the society. 

2. Please do not ignore and deny the brilliant improvements that outstanding foreigners bring to US. They are not intended to grasp the job opportunity with natives, while they are exactly suitable and adequate for many positions with higher educational backgrounds and skills.

3. As everyone knows, competition does incentive greater creation and better way of living. If we prevent something just because of the fear for advantageous threats, we may lose the chance to become stronger. 

4. If Anerica, the most diversified and human right protect place, lost its most feature things, we are not sure what it will be for several years later.
