VICTOR DREW I strongly support to proposal of "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees" due to following reasons:

(i) Highly skilled, foreign-born workers who have been educated at U.S. colleges and universities in STEM fields are engines of entrepreneurship and economic growth. Keeping more of these foreign-born STEM graduates in the United States is vital to ensuring a return to economic prosperity and maintaining America's competitiveness in the global marketplace.

(ii) According to a NAFSA (National Association of Foreign Student Advisers)analysis of the 2012-13 school year, international students and their families at U.S. colleges contributed $24 billion to the economy. The money doesn't just come from tuition for which international students often times pay the full rate but it also comes in support of transportation, buying cars, housing, food, retail and telecommunications. 

(iii) A study from the University of CaliforniaBerkeley and Duke University found that over 25 percent of U.S. engineering and tech companies created between 1995 and 2005 had at least one foreign-born founder, and in 2006, these companies employed 450,000 people and claimed a combined $52 billion in sales.

(iv) Having international students on our campuses helps globalize our campuses and it helps prepare American students for the world it is now.
