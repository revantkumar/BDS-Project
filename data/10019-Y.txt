I definitely support this policy and believe a longer OPT will benefit US in the development of science, technology and economics.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. People who have studied STEM related majors play crucial role in the development of US technology, economics. Unfortunately, more and more american students would rather choose to study in business school, medical school and law school and fewer and fewer american students are interested in STEM majors. It is of great importance for america to launch policies to attract more and more international students to study in the US and make their contributions to the US. The 1 -year OPT allows international students to make their contribution for short term but does not have the ability to keep those students continuously making their contribution. The short term OPT policy would force the international students to leave after their 1-year practical training. As a result, the US universities and the companies/institutions would play a role helping other countries educate and train talents. A longer OPT (for example, 36-month OPT) would allow international students to make longer contribution to the US. More importantly, the US government should try their best to keep the excellent students(for example graduate students, PhD students) in the US instead of forcing them to leave. In particular, the US universities usually invest a lot in a international PhD students (at least $200, 000). It is insane if those students are force to make contributions for other countries just because they are foreigners.
