I think this is a good policy, which could improve US's IT companies. As we can see, most of the US citizen are not willing to study engineering major, which is hard and boring. IT companies cannot hire enough people without foreign students. And the fact is that foreign students is becoming more and more important in a IT company. Without them, IT company will crush and US's economy will hurt very much. One year's OPT is not enough both for students and companies. Company cannot hire a student who may just work for one year and leave.
