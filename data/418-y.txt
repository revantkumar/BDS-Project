Xiaoye Huang As an international student, I certainly support the proposal. However, I strongly believe it is also really beneficial for US citizens. It is hard to imagine how many US citizens work in industries related to international students. And since studying in US is really expensive, many international students are from really wealthy families. They buy a lot of expensive things in US, which is obviously good for US economy. For example, several of my friends have already bought really expensive cars, although they have just come here for less than a semester. There are many restaurants whose customers are mainly international students nearby. And most Chinese students will buy a lot of luxury brands products for their relatives and friends before going back home. Also, the tuition fee for university itself is also a huge income for US. Some people may worry that international students will make US citizens jobless. However, the fact is if international students doesn't come, countless US citizens will be jobless.
