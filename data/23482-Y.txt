OPT STEM Extension of 24 months definitely sounds a great relief to all the hard-work, time, dedication and money put in by all the International students. America has always been known as "The Land of Opportunities", that's the reason why thousands of qualified international students take great courage to leave own families and start a whole new identity in America. The global transfer of knowledge can greatly decrease if there is no sufficient STEM OPT extension and the limited number of H1 visas.

As you all might know the tuition and taxes paid by we international students is many times that of American citizens. The economy can also be affected.

Please have the OPT STEM Extension and possibly increase number of H1 visas.
