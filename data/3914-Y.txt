Many of these F1 students get the scholarship from the American universities that money coming from the government funding which is ultimately coming from the taxpayer's pocket. If the students graduate and leave the country, it is a wasted resource for the U.S. government. Rather, if they are allowed to undergo the extended practical training, that would benefit the students to test their learned skills and to gain experience in their field of study and also benefit the American economy by allowing American companies to add new talent and diversity to their workforce.
Further, some of these F1 students pay thousands of dollars for their tuition fees. If they are forced to leave the U.S. soon after their graduation, they would be treated as foreign graduates with no tested skills in their home country. After paying thousands of dollars for their education in U.S. and with no jobs in their home country because of their untested skills, they would surely go bankrupt. If this continues, why would new students come for education in the U.S. ? 
In my view, extending the OPT program allows sustainable development for both the American economy and the students. Hence, I strongly support this OPT extension program.
