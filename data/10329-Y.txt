The OPT is so important not only to the foreign students seeking job/training opportunities that further their learning and work skills, it also plays an important role for the US economy. I've been in the financial industry for the last 20 years, and went through many hiring experiences. I know first hand that the well trained foreign graduate students in the fields of math and economics have filled a huge gap of the work force shortage we frequently encounter. Without them, my company's work would have been severely impacted. I support the expanding proposal.
