Sirs,

We wish to express our opposition to the F-1 program known as Optional Practical Training.

We live in a time of widespread unemployment as depicted by record lows in the nation's Labor Participation Rate, and a time of great under-employment where so many cannot find meaningful full time work.

OPT has had the effect of denying American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 by giving often well paying jobs to foreign workers,.

Employers are encouraged to give preference to foreign employees because they will save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers. Additionally, the workers will save 5.65 percent as well. This has an effect of undermining the Social Security system and Medicare. OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds during the years 2009-2013.

During this time of economic struggle for good paying jobs and a Social Security/Medicare system under financial stress we cannot afford this welfare program for foreign students and employers seeking to dodge their social responsibilities.

Thank you.

Sincerely, 
Edward & Sue Johnson
