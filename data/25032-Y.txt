As a phd student from China, I totally don't understand why some people are against this proposal. I have been to several career fairs, and what I experienced was that employers would always consider American students first, which was understandable because of the sponsorship required by international students. So why would somebody think we are taking away your jobs? In addition, there are barely any American phd students work on the same research topic as I do to improve the roll stability of semi-trucks. How do I know that? Because there are very few publications composed by students with "American" names! Please recall what I commented here when you see a truck rollover accident on a highway, and keep in mind that such an accident might be avoided if I got a chance to stay here a little big longer so that I can contribute more to develop a safer traffic.
