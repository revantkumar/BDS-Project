I an a PhD analytical chemist that spent his career as a researcher, educator, administrator and entrepreneur. I worked at professional jobs both in the public and private sector, including 8 years at the National Science Foundation. During my 40 year career, I watched our nation switch from its focus of educating our own people to become scientists and engineers to the importing of STEM students and professionals from foreign countries. This change has contributed significantly to the erosion of our previous leadership in science and technology. Our STEM-focused federal agencies and universities are now overrun with individuals from foreign countries. This fact has further reduced the number of U.S. citizens that want to pursue STEM careers. For some unwarranted reason, we have decided that foreign students are better prospects for STEM careers than citizen students. Rather than spending resources on improving the preparation of our citizens for STEM careers, we have opted to simply import STEM people rather than to grow and nurture our own. Whereas importing STEM talent might be a cost-efficient, short-term approach, I submit that such an approach has a number of negative long-term consequences for the U.S. So, let's quit taking the easy path of importing STEM and instead, focus once again on producing STEM people from our talented citizens!
