I strongly support this rule. 

This rule is essential for keeping U.S. higher education attractive for international STEM students. Certain projects in STEM do take several years to complete and a full project life cycle experience is necessary for STEM students, especially those at master's or higher level. For example, in the IC(integrated circuit) design industry, a server CPU project takes about 3 years, from evaluating the performance improvement of tens of design proposal and combinations of them, to implement and verify the logic, converting logic equations to a "blueprint" that contains billions of transistors and tens of layers of wire, send it to factory, then get the real IC back and test it. The experience is so valuable that not getting it will impact the competitiveness of students, and thus impact the competitiveness of US higher education for international STEM students. 

Second, the new rule improves and increases oversight over STEM OPT extensions. This ensures only students that really need OPT extension get it and should minimize potential negative impacts to U.S. workers in STEM fields.
