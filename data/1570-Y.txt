More and more countries are using this policy to attract more talented students to their countries. And now the US is among the best because the OPT policy is friendly to all the students. A lot of students gains experience here after school, and the companies here are benefited because they got talented people working for them for a while.

However, if the US stopped having this extension, more and more talented students will be attracted to other countries, the great companies here such as Facebook and Google will lose a lot of engineers. May be there will be a new Google in Japan or China.

In conclusion, the OPT extension policy should be passed to make the US as one of the most competitive countries in the world.
