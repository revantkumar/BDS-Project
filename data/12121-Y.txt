I would like to say that I support this document not only it benefits International graduate student, but also protects Americans benefits.
Many people are against this document because it gives International students opportunities to stay in the U.S. The competence of International students make Americans feel threatened because it seems like that International students will get jobs and let more and more Americans lose their jobs.
However, I dont think so because of two things.
The first is the e-verify system of every company. If a company uses e-verify system, it means that employers wont employ any students for the reason of race. Therefore, I think no bias will appear and the e-verify system gives fair competition to anyone. Although there are a lot of International students every year, the percent of the International students in employment wont be over Americans.
Secondly, Please read these sentences from the document:
(1) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; 
(2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and 
(3) the student's opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives. 
It means that the law still protects U.S. workers and it demands high quality International students. Therefore, I dont think that the International students will threaten U.S. workers jobs.
