Zhan Wang Extending OPT to 24 months is extremely beneficial to both the employers and the country.

Our education system has invested a lot for the international students and should allow them to pay it back by their hard work. Otherwise it is a loss for the country and they are back and benefit their own countries -- some are our direct competitors.

Also the employers DO need foreign labours. For example, Facebook directly hires engineers from China. We loose talents by not allowing the OPT extension.

The history of America is a history of immigration. Although OPT students don't necessarily become immigrants, our history just shows that the country was built up by talents from all over the world.
