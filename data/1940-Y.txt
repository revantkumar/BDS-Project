First of all I am totally supporting this new rule. And regarding other negative comments, I would like to say, in my university which is ranked top 30 in many of the stem fields, one of the common scenario is if you are sitting in classroom for a graduate level class, and guess what, there are 4 American students in many of my classes versus 38 international students. Just thinking about the supply of students with knowledge in technical data analysis and prediction, if you are a recruiter, will you hire international students if there is no "American" supply? Or just let your company sit there for a good amount of time to wait for a qualified American candidate to show up? Not to mention that Americans who are in OTHER countries stealing THEIR jobs as English teachers. In China for example, we have a lot of people who have degrees in English from accredited universities in English-speaking countries but lots of English teachers are American. Why are you Americans stealing other countries' jobs?
