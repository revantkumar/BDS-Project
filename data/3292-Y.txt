I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S.

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. It helps companies choose more capable candidates.

Thanks.
