I think it is crummy that you are thinking of giving foreign students a pass to the front of the line for jobs, over Legal Citizens of the United States. 
You are taking a good living and jobs that our citizens are qualified for, giving it to someone who is not a citizen. I understand the greedy business like Disney are whining that they can't find anyone qualified, but they already have qualified people working for them and then they want the qualified people to train the lower paying foreigners before they fire them. Something is wrong with this picture. 
It is about time our government started thinking about our citizens instead of worrying about people who are not our citizens.
I don't care if they are here legally they are still not citizens and to me are not entitled to the same privileges that our citizens are supposed to receive.

Stop this Rule, it stinks.
