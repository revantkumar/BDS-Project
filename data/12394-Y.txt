I strongly support this new OPT policy.

1. This policy allow time for F1 students get training in the industrial world. If a F1 student can only work for a year, he/she will be able to get the offer from high technical company whose project may take longer time.

2. This policy will encourage more student to live and study in The US which will facilitate local economy.
