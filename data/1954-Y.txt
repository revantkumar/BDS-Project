The vacation of the original 17 months STEM OPT is a tragedy for all the international students who is currently working on STEM OPT or soon will need those. But, it's glad to hear government is fighting as hard as they can to help our international students.

I believe the original STEM OPT rule was published under emergency act for a reason. From what I learned by researching, the U.S. was under economic depression and they want to keep the talents that American education system trained so that they could contribute to the economy.

The U.S. economy is recovering in the recent years partly because it's a world known impression that the U.S. is the best place for people around the world that who have talent and want to pursue their dreams. People come here to study, to gain practical experience and meanwhile to contribute to the country and its economy. This is also the way how the U.S. established from a colony to a modern country of freedom.

It will look bad for the U.S. government if the government fails to protect the rights/dreams of those international students. Because talents around the world will hold their step, and think they could be abandoned and urged away anytime if some organizations who are less competent (statistics shows that international students are not underpaid) but have ancestors came to the country earlier than them can "exile" them. If the U.S. would like to keep its leading role in S.T.E.M. areas, there has to be some law and rules that not only protect those international talents' rights but also attract more talents from all over the world. 

This proposed 24 months STEM OPT is an inspiring act of government showing their will and faith in protecting our international young talents and attracting more talents. This rule can benefit the U.S. in a lot of ways and I barely see any negative impact.
