Strongly SUPPORT the new rule!!! Reasons as follows: 1. Technology is the key contribution to the GDP of America, and international students who on are on STEM provide fully support for this field. They give new power to tech companies, they keep doing harding work. So America need us, and we need her. Why not make this relationship even better? 2. We did not decrease the job opportunity to the citizen. More and more job needed US Citizenship. So actual we only got chance for very small part this filed. The problem is not from STEM students.
