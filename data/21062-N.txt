It is very apparent that Barack Obama does not have the interests of the American people in mind when he has generated
more than a thousand Executive Orders favoring Muslims, Syrian refugees, millions of Illegal aliens from South America, condones the Iranian nuclear program, favors Gay/Lesbians/Transexuals marriage and making an abomination out of the civil service program. His spending and law breaking is beyond belief, and I question why he is still in office. People hate him for the damage he has done and his failure to have viable foreign policy and firing over 300 senior officers from our 
exhausted military. Failing to fix the VA disaster. Screwing around with the Middle East. Wasting the treasury of this nation means nothing to him. Piling on hundreds of billions of additional cost to Social Security is a calculated way for him to bankrupt an entitlement program over 54 million Americans depend on. Everything he does seems designed to make matters worse!
