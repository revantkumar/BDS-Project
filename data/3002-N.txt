This is a request that the Department of Homeland Security is NOT allowed to expand Optional Practical Training program. Originally, the program was for foreign students who planned to return home upon completion of their training. Now, many stay. This has caused 430,000 jobs lost by US students in the 2009 - 2013 time period at a cost of $4 billion to Social Security and Medicare funds. If hired, employers save money because they do not have to pay FICA and Medicare taxes on these non-citizens.

Please do not allow expansion of this program.
