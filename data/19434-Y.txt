I support this rule. OPT stem extension will benefit US economy and US job market. Government should make policies that can make talented people in stem area to stay. Study shows that a high-tech job position can create 3.4 relevant supporting roles in other relevant areas like manufacturing, supply chain and other supporting sectors. Having smart foreign student to stay will benefit US economy and job market in the long run.
