I live in Hollywood, CA, and we need to take care of and give jobs to our own legal USA citizens. In Los Angeles County alone we haVe 6,000 homeless USA veterans living on the streets,we need to help them, train them, give them and our real, legal USA citizens the training, jobs, and opportunies not to foreigners. Their own countries should take care of them. We have way too many legal USA citizens out of work and our millions of USA graduates can't find work. CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME!
