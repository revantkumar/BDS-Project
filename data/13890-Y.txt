The greatness of the US lies in the fact that she has the geatest attraction to the most eminent people in the wolrd, who constitutes an indispensable part of the continual source of innovation and new opportunities of the country, especially those in the STEM field--the driving force of economic growth in the 21st century. Some fear that those people will steal the job opportunities of the domestic ones, which is absolutely wrong. The benefits they bring to this country--the job opportunities and fortune they will create, the vitalness they will instill into the economy, the new inventions they wil make is overwhelming. introducing competition is not a bad thing for the whole country, since only in this way can the US stay competitive among the world. Some people are just looking for excuses for their incompetence and the unwillingness to strive for excellence, which will encumber the country's economic growth if their wishes come true. Actually they even didn't realize that this act will also do benefit to them through the increase in job opportunities and growth in economics. At present the OPT period is definitively not long enough for those who want to contribute to the country and realize their American dream to prove their competence and apply for the H1B visa, since the quota is so limited. Therefore, extending the OPT period will give them more time and chances to stay and contribute and is consistent with the creed of the US and should be implemented.
