As an F-1 students, I highly support OPT-extension for the following reasons:

1. OPT is not related to the minimum wage. International students who are working on OPT make a huge contribution to U.S. economics, especially for those STEM related fields. The extension is the best way to keep foreign talented persons in those high-tech, science, internet industries etc.

2. OPT students pay a lot of income taxes.

3. The diversity of the employment could increase the creativity of work especially in STEM fields. U.S. are losing talents because of H1-B Cap-Gap every year. It's good way to extend their OPT.
