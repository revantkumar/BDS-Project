A GOOD policy! I guess there might be some misunderstandings in those who commented before reading this rule. 
1. Foreign employees they DO PAY TAX.
2. This rule only give foreign students a chance to get a job,that's all. It is not a GUARANTEE. Applicants compete for jobs EQUALLY before interviewers from companies (having said that, foreigners already suffer many many constrains compared with native people). What's wrong with companies trying to get the most competitive employees they could reach out to?
3. America play the lead role in the world, in education, technology and social security. Foreign students do CONTRIBUTE to it. They pay tuition, do research, expand their universities' and the nation's reputations in every aspects, let alone technical guys in every high-tech companies. Now is it fair that not even giving them a chance to MERELY stay some more time in the community they love and help build?
