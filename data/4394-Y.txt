Paul Nash International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century. If intelligent International students with STEM degrees are allow ed to work more, they would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as the technology development.
