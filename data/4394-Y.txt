The proposal should be supported and here's my reason. The US have long been a country welcoming immigrants from around the world, which is among the root reasons why it has become the most powerful economy today. Facing the threats from rising developing countries, it is undoubted that more talent power are needed to arm the US. And it is never a good idea to let the talents growing outside the US without knowing how fast they are growing and how strong they are now. The best way is let the competition happen, and happen here.
