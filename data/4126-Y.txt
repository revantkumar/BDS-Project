I chose to come to the US for my study because of the OPT and OPT extensions for STEM students. Without OPT and OPT extensions I would have gone to Canada or Australia, for they definitely have cheaper tuition with the same high quality education. 
So I strongly support this rule if the United States still wants to attract international students to pay for its expensive tuition and living expenses, which is the major source for thousands of American universities' revenue and also makes a big contribution for US economy. Because, millions of international students coming to the US for study each year are important consumers of various US products (housing, food, entertainment, movies, textbooks, computer, clothes, travelling, etc), which is an important reason for the prosperity of US economy.
