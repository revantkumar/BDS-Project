There is absolutely no oversight on this program. 

How do you make sure that the students are working in the Field they are in. I personally know bogus employers
providing a certificate saying they are working, including Indian body shops. This is used by the students to stay in status.

There ought to be more enforcement and oversight to weed out. With the current USCIS resources, I neither see this as feasible nor doable. Please consider having strong enforcement measures. People are messing around with the loopholes left and right as there is no oversight and enforcement. I see this happening quite extensively among Indian students and it is shameful, but you guys are providing the platform to cheat. People are really unemployed, working in grocery stores and Gas stations with this EAD, and producing fake certificates to stay is status.

Please have strong enforcement measures.

Thanks
