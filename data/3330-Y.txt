It is wise and should gain supports to expand OPT for F-1 students with STEM degrees. 

It does not affect job opportunities of us citizens, and by contrast, without STEM degree students, US cannot grow as strong as now. Look at industries which require STEM degrees, how many international students are working there? If a US citizen has the same work expertise with an international student, or even a bit lower work expertise (but people think they have language and culture advantage), the company will recruit a US citizen. Therefore, the large number of STEM students being hired indicates that US citizen labors are quite not enough for current job market. Without STEM expansion, there will be a big whole in company recruitment. No mention that these fields are usually high tech area which will affect US economy and impact in the world directly. 

It will decrease interest of international students to study in US here, which will dramastically decrease education revenue of US. US is not the only place that people can come to study. France and Germany does not require tuitions. Canada has far better policy for international people to obtain maple card. Most of time, people just would like to get out of the home door to have a look at the world while studying, and country choice is not that critical. Please don't close the door to internationals. It will harm US itself.
