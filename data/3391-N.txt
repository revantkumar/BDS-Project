The opening words of our founding document, The U.S. Constitution, states, "We the people of the United States..."

Our Constitutional Representative government was set up to protect the welfare and rights of We the People. Anyone who seeks such representation must follow the rules to become a citizen. 

To attempt to bypass the basic principles of our Founding documents and make these protections and advantages available without their becoming citizens is a violation of our founding documents.
