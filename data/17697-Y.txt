Last year, President Obama announced a new plan to extend Chinese student visas to five years, expecting more contribution to US economy from international students' tuitions.

However, one important factor that prevents international students from seeking access to higher education in US is the H1B visa lottery policy. Even if they get a job offer after graduation, student visa holders may be repatriated if they are not lucky enough to win in the H1B lottery. The longer the OPT, the more chances of visa lottery international students may have, the more appealing higher education in US would be to international students. Actually, if the OPT could be long enough for STEM students to accumulate working experience, they don't even need to apply for H1B -- as they become senior professionals, they can get great job offers from their home country, so there is no need for them to compete with US citizens for job opportunities. OPT is the extension of higher education, not the interim between student visa and immigration visa. 

From the perspective of promoting US economy by attracting more international students, the OPT extension policy would be a success. Without such an extension, the competition for job opportunities in US would be intensified -- international students would have to apply for H1B or even immigration visa so that they can become senior professionals. Without OPT extension for STEM students, the one-year OPT would be too short, hence prevents international students from attending higher education in US.
