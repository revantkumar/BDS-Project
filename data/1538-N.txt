This type of hiring is un-American. My daughter can not find a decent paying job as the non-Americans are being hired to keep wages down. You are destroying America and you do ot care about our American children and their futures. This is so un-American and it shows that we can not trust our government at take care of business for our own people. It is a shame that our own government has turned against us. We should help our own children first. But you are not in any way going to help Americans. I am ashamed of our politicians in allowing this type of thing to happen in our great country of America.
