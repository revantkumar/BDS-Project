Yixian Shen Although some people insist that STEM students will influent American citizen to get a job, the fact is that only a few American citizens can do STEM related jobs, like CS, EE, etc. And these American citizens already have a lot of advantages over F-1 students and can easily get a related job without any issues.If F-1 students with OPT extension have to leave our country every year, it will make big lose to technology companies. For example, in California there is countless high tech companies hire F-1 students using OPT extension. If these students are forced to leave California, who will do the jobs for these companies? American citizen who have the knowledge is far not enough to do these jobs. We need these F-1 students to do what native citizen cannot do. On the other side, these students will go back to the competitive country like Russia, China, India...people with high tech knowledge are so precious that we cannot lose. If we can accept so many illegal immigrations, why cannot we accept the well educated students working for the country's future? United States of America is an immigration country accepting all kinds of people from the world as long as they work hard and make US better.
