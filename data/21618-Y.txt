Everyone should be treated equally on this issue. This is no matter of nationality or racial. Don't be short-sighted on this issue. Jobs are always ready for those who are qualified, capable and intelligent. Therefore, the U.S should provide and maintain the chance for foreigners to compete with natives. Like i said, the opportunities are for those who earn it. U.S is a mix pot of different races and colors, and the diversity and equal opportunity are what help the US survive and thrive.
