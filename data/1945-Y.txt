So why US is giving STEM students this extension? Because there are just INSUFFICIENT STEM students with American citizenship. If you go to any universities with some reputation, you will be surprised how few American citizens there are in graduate school. If you get a chance, take a look at silicon valley, and imagine what an empty city it will be without immigrants.
