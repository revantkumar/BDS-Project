974,926 international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $30.5 billion and supported more than 373,000 jobs to the U.S. economy during the 2014-2015 academic year.

If you tell them that them can only stay 1 year in US after graduation. Most of them won't be so interested in coming to study in US anymore. They have plenty of choices.
