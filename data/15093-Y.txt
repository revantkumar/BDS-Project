I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. Students who made it successfully to United States are mostly talented ones who standout in their peer considering the strict admission process of American students. They should be given at least equal opportunity, if not better ones, to practice their skills and contribute to this country after graduation.

2. It's American spirit to give everyone equal opportunity. Diversity is the bases for United States to build its strength.

3. It's also good for American education and economy. There are a lot of high tech, especially IT companies that depend largely on foreign talents. They are well paid and work on very advanced areas. These are evidence that foreign talents are not taking jobs away from American natives. As a matter of fact, based on my international friends experience, some companies are even reluctant to hire foreign students because of the added inconvenience of dealing with immigration issues. 

4. 12 month with 24 month extra is also a good amount of time for a project to be finished. With this, companies would benefit, they won't need to do rehiring, re training during project progress. Also, international students could build and gain enough experience.
