Dennis Cheever There is no way that DHS should even be considering a RULE such as this. Number one reason, DHS is not legally able to do this. Number two reason, DHS should be shut down as an affront to the US citizens. They are nothing but Obama,s Secret Police. Number three reason, they do not do anything that the already existing law enforcement agencies was not doing. Therefore, why in the hell do they exist.
