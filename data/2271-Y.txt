First of all if this proposal is approved, the STEM students could have more experience as well as konwledge in order to better server US companies, and therefore improve the life quality of US people. Second, there are huge gap between the need from STEM companies and the supply from US local talents, so giving more flexibility could contribute to the development of US companies and the overall economic. Third, opt as well as opt extension are not respobsible for the immigration problem, rather they provide an approach to screen highly qualified foreigne talents for US. Therefore, for all the reasons above, I STRONGLY SUPPORT the opt extension proposal.
