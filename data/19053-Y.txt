Well, I strongly support the new rule "OPT STEM 24 months".

The reasons are simply but strong, this rule is much better for the US economy situation. Right now
the situation needs labor to support the economy recover, think about the engineering field, there are lots 
of companies which need many persons to support its working. But right now, only few percentage of us students what to choose engineering major as their study fields. This is even worse in master and Phd degrees. So the problem is: who can save US economy? 
The answer is simple. International students can help US to solve this case. We staying here can support lots 
of companies. Think about IT fields, if there is no STEM, what will happen in
Silicon Valley? Also, if there is no STEM, what will happen in Detroit? It is very hard for US to recover its 
economy situation to this level. Please do not fall back again!

We support the new rules! God bless American!
