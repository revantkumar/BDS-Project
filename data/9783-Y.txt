This improvement on the extension of OPT period is extremely important for F-1 students who has a STEM degree. More talented people can work in US and pursue their career dream in the world-class companies. Also it can help US attract more start and knowledgeable elites to come and work here. I highly agree and vote for this extension improvement decision.
