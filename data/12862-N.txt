My son graduated with a BA majoring in Global Studies with a focus on Russian Language, History and Culture 2 years ago. After graduation he decided he did not want to apply to work for the CIA and returned to college to work towards a STEM degree in Astro Physics, Geology and Volcanology. After reading about this proposed rule I am worried and concerned for his future occupational aspirations.

What I see happening to the American Citizens in this country alarms me. Profits over promoting the working American Citizen has become the precedence of the United States White House Administration and Congress. This is unjust and a insult to the hard working citizens of this country. If our Founding Fathers were still alive...what would they think....what would they say?? 

It is time for our elected leaders to get some "back bone", stand up to powerful corporate entities and to invest in the citizens of America and their children's future!! 

You are the guardian for the people who you were elected to represent!!
