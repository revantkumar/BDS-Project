Personally, I am in favor of the act to make OPT last for 24 months. America needs immigrants. Immigrants are a major source for social and economical momentum for they introduce new ideas, provide labor force and bring along the newest cultural information from around the globe. The method of drawing best minds to work for American companies is actually what makes the U.S. a unique and outstanding country which posts a strong influence on all other nations around the world. There is surely the case that indigenous people feel he pressure of competition of the job market, however, this is a necessity of making their country strong. If anyone in America feels proud of his or her great mother country U.S.A, they should know that it is not built by only the ones who has been living here since the MayFlower. It was created by different peoples from the whole world who dare to follow their dreams in the faraway land across the oceans.
