Yuan Yang I am an assistant professor in an ivy league university. OPT extension is very important for us to support researchers such as postdocs and benefit the competitiveness of US in science and technology. It helps us reduce financial pressure, focus more on research instead of pursuing funding. I fully believe that long OPT extension in STEM will benefit the prosperity of US instead of hurting it.
