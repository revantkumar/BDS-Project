To whom it may concern,

I am Yiru Shen, a Chinese student studying at Clemson University. I am here to support the policy of OPT extension for STEM degree. As is known, STEM is playing a significant role in developing science, engineering fields in USA. As a fact, many employees that work for these engineering and science companies are not America-born. Actually most of them are from India, China and other countries. If the extension could work, many students will have the opportunity to work longer for USA. For example, the current project I'm in is to estimate intake calories for meals to help obese people control their weights. To be honest, more than 50% of the group members are Indian and Chinese. So are other research groups in my school. 

On the other hand, if the extension cannot be valid, many people will lose the great chance to work here. In turn, many technology companies, such as Facebook, Google, Oracle will lose many talents working for them, since these people don't have valid status to stay. it will result in the result that the IT companies will lose great money. 

In conclusion, extension of STEM is a win-win for both international students and the USA companies. Please take this fact into consideration.

Thanks!
Yiru Shen
