I get very annoyed at our government when they are constantly trying to help workers from other countries and they ignore American workers. Many companies let American workers go so that they can hire foreign worker for less money. Many American engineers and other American STEM workers in their 50's find their jobs are being given to foreign workers before they reach the age of retirement. THIS HURTS AMERICANS! I get companies want to be profitable but I think it is a crime to allow more and more foreign workers in at the EXPENSE of the American worker. Something is incredibly wrong when a country's government cares less about its people but breaks all rules and laws to allow the foreign worker to come here to go to school or work while laying off the American! 
I have two teen children and I worry about their future because as we struggle to get them into college and pay for it, our government is allowing more and more foreign students and workers in; so will their be jobs for our young Americans? Does this administration care about our future workers? Do they care about any American? Even Republicans seem to put the American worker on the back burner as everyone pushes for more help from foreign workers. Also as colleges take more foreign students does that put American students at a disadvantage to getting in to the same school?
Our government should put the American student first in front of foreign students and it should put the American worker ahead of the foreign workers! No 50 something American should lose their job so that a company can benefit from hiring foreign workers. It is morally wrong and it is very un American!

Do not give the foreign student or the foreign worker more time or more opportunities than you do the same American student or American worker!
It is past time to put American's first!
