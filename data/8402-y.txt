Sam Jeong I strongly SUPPORT opt expansion.

1. Graduates from STEM majors have been making tremendous contribution to the US economy. IT industry has developed so fast in recent years because of many foreign students who graduated from STEM majors to a large extend, which also creates many positions for American people. The development of economy helps building up more companies and hiring more Americans. Also, they pay a significant amount of tax to federal and state governments. 

2. International students with STEM degree is an important role to keep the USA the most powerful country around the world. Facing severe challenges from India, Europe and China in technology and economy every day, and majority of the foreign students in science and engineering are from these countries. The current immigration law makes it very hard for these students to work legally in the USA even if they are over qualified for high-tech positions in American companies. If we force them to go back to their countries, so our highest level education system is just training students who work for our competitors. By setting up this OPT expansion, these talented students will have a chance to make their contribution to industry here.

3. Please be aware part of PhD students and most master students from other countries pay much more tuition fee and spend more living expenses than local students, which make big contribution to American economy and universities, these money will provide American people more jobs and better education quality in return.
