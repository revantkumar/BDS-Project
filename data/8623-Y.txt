I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I have chosen an U.S. graduate school for my further study. And the reason I chose U.S is because it could provide the best resource, education and opportunity. And I believe that's also the reason why many international student come to U.S. every year. We want to be the expert in our own field and we could not achieve that just by studying in school. We need to learn through some pragmatic practice, and that's why we need the OPT extension.
The U.S. is an inclusive country and that's why it's attracting many elite all over the world. And these elites helped the blooming of industry, especially in the field of electronic engineering and computer science. And one year of OPT is too short to achieve something significant. So I believe the extension will benefit not only the stem students but also the industry related. And if the economic blooming, the country will receive more taxes which will benefit the country's own citizens.
Also, the OPT extension will attract more stem international students and they need to consume and rent houses from local residents, so it also could help the local citizens to earn some extra money.
