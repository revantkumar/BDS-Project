No other country in this world has the luxury of even debating about denying students with technical background the right to work. The truth is, America has the best advanced education system but has failed immeasurably in terms of actually retaining international talents compared to its success in educating them. the narrow-mindedness of protestors of STEM extension is that, allowing skilled workers to explore the job market doesn't make this country fail - it's what makes this country great. With employment rate inching down and the economy going back on track, the demand for labor is there. The fact that international students are posting about this issue means the supply of labor is there. STEM is currently the best solution to match both sides and it should be kept in place instead of ripped apart.
