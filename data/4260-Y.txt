Mike Gunnoe Generally it is a good proposal.
The rule will definitely improve the competitiveness of the United States.
Some people just misunderstood this rule. They think this rule will bring more immigrants to the US and hurt the benefit of the citizens. But, ACTUALLY, this is a non-immigrant rule, while won't bring MORE immigrant to US but immigrants will more skillful that is good for the US.
Hope this proposal will pass.
