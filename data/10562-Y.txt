I think this is a great idea. It can bring positive influence to economic in the United States. Also working in a company, they can bring diversity into this company. It can benefit the employee and help company to build group of diversity. We can learn from F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees as well. Especially, for Chinese and Indian, they are really smart and they can make progress on the technology in the USA. Therefore, I totally support this proposing.
