The international students should be given the time to practice what they have learned from college education into industries. The STEM major graduates will not only be able to strengthen their practical skills, but also contribute to the US economy with a longer OPT extension - a lot of OPT workers now work in the tech companies in Bay Area etc. are contributing to innovation and development of technology in the states. The proposed OPT extension helps to establish a stronger foundation of culturally diverse and strong economic system. The new OPT rule purposes a more strict requirement on the employers to make sure that US workers will not lose their job opportunities because of the new rule. Therefore, given that the employers should treat the OPT workers and US workers equally, I think it is fair to give the OPT workers chances to work in the US. I support the proposed OPT extension.
