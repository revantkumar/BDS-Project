I am totally agree with the OPT rule. 

Nowhere is the contribution of immigrants more apparent than in the high-technology and other knowledge-based sectors. Silicon Valley and other high-tech sectors would cease to function if we foolishly were to close our borders to skilled and educated immigrants. These OPT student represent human capital that can make our entire economy more productive. OPT student have developed new products, such as the Java computer language, that have created employment opportunities for millions of Americans.

Some American stem student lose job as software developer actually show their incompetent. The high skilled sectors like computer science development, is ever changing field. It require hard working and lifelong learning. If you think you can sleep with your stem diploma, you would be punished by your laziness not because of OPT.
