The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to 
corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States
from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages 
and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the 
pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.

The efforts of our elected officials should go to supporting programs that educate and train our own citizens and not to 
supporting programs that import cheap labor from foreign countries. How will our own children be incentivized to study 
in STEM programs if they know that at the end of their training, they will have to compete with an almost infinite pool of 
foreign works who have limited barriers to coming to the US?
