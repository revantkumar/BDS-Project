I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT extension rule. 

I'm an international Electrical Engineering master student from China. I had other options in Singapore, HongKong and UK to pursue my master degree before I came to US. The most crucial reason I choose to study here is US could offer me with many industrial training opportunities during school and after graduation. So if OPT extension passed, US could attract much more international talents around the world who contribute their knowledge to this country.
