I support this proposal strongly and here is why, from a personal experience: 
I am the Vice President of Engineering at a large US technology company. Over the last few years, my company has found it difficult to fill STEM positions requiring advanced skills because the US is facing a shortage of qualified STEM graduates. 

As everybody knows, America's competitiveness in the 21st century will be based on how well we can lead in STEM. 
Although the proposed rule is a short term fix, it will help the nation in maintaining our lead in inventions, scientific discovery and engineering innovation in the immediate future, by allowing brilliant foreign-born STEM students to work in the USA. I do believe that we need a long term solution in terms of improving the primary education in the STEM fields in American schools and encouraging more students to study in STEM fields.
