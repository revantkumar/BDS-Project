I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension. I believe this is a requirement for the long-term development of US.

Some people think that opt-extension is not necessary. They may think 12 months sound a long time to get H1B. However, some of my friends don't even have time to get H1B after they get a job after graduation. They were able to bring big contribution to the company since they are really talented. However, they can only go to other countries with their experience and knowledge obtained in US. They are all doing excellent now and brings a lot of job opportunities to other countries by starting companies. The opt-extension is to make sure that the people who are really great getting job opportunity and contributing to US. The real talented people are the ones which can really lead the development of a country. They can do well wherever they are and they may choose to go other countries due to the short time of opt. Opt-extension policy is really the key to win in the scramble for talent.
