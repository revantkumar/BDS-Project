I strongly support improving and expanding OPT for F1 Non-immigrant Students. US citizens should not be worried that their jobs will be taken by foreign students for the following reasons.

1. As non-immigrant students, a lot of industries has already sets limitations for hiring non-immigrant students. As I know, most of industrial companies require foreign candidates to prove their long-term working qualification, such as H1 working visa, before these foreign candidates can be considered. In other words, foreign students with only F1 student visa hold very small chance to get a chance in most of these American companies. In fact, US citizens' jobs are truly secured. 

2. In current situation, most of positions which are taken by foreign students do not conflict with those ones which most US citizens are interested in. As in automotive industry, most international students are taking engineering analysis jobs. Tough and boring ones, but they work really hard, while most of US employees serve as product engineers which require more than engineering background, but also strong communicating and interpersonal skills. US employees are born with these abilities, so that international students are extremely less competitive with US workers. What foreign students do, as I see, is taking the most hard job, do their best to support auto industry and keep auto companies highly competitive in global market. By this situation, auto companies are able to create more positions for US citizens and expand business. But if these foreign students are expelled, it takes time to hire and training new engineers from US candidates. In current intensive auto industry, this may not be a good way to go.
