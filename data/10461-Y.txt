From my personal opinion, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal with following reasons:

1 International students and workers make a huge contribution to the high technology company in United States. OPT extension will continue support the success for US company to keep strong ability to competing with the other company across world.

2 OPT provide a great opportunity to international student and also domestic student to learn skills that they need to survive in industry. With OPT, international student can enter company to learn more skill than they learn in school. And by communicate with international student, local student also gain great benefit.

3 OPT does't need to be a negative impact for the labor market for US citizens. OPT does't mean international student will get a privilege beyond local people. Actually there are a lot regulation to make sure the company will not using such rule to against local people to get job. So US citizens should not worry this rule from their own perspective.
