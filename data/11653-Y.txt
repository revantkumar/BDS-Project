I support this proposed rule "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students".
As a doctoral student studying and conducting research in the field of STEM in the United States, I understand the meaning, importance and positive impact of this proposed rule. The extension of the OPT period for students in STEM field will bring great benefit to the United States' education system and industry. It would not only let the Universities in the United States remain competitive in the world as mentioned in the summary, it will also prevent talents from leaving this country. I have heard about the story of a Ph.D. graduate from UC Berkeley Engineering (one of the top engineering schools in the U.S.), who had to leave the U.S. because of not being selected in the H1B visa lottery. With an extended OPT time, this might not happen.
