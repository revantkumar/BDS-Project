I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international student from China and was a 

software engineer intern at Mindtree. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master 

degree in US, Singapore, Hong Kong and Britain. The most important reason I choose to study here is US 

could provide me the industry training opportunity during class learning and after graduation. 

Education takes a huge amount of expense. (over 6% GDP). And we all know knowledge is everything nowadays. Without the attraction to international students and talents, the industrial education market will be dramatically hurt, not to mention the loss to the potential scientific and non-scientific projects. You spent years to niches this wonderful learning niche for both domestic and international students and you don't wanna ruin it with anti-progress action.

What's hurting the US job market is the overseas outsourcing instead of bringing in the FOREIGN 

talents. Giants like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. cultivated an open and positive environment 

attracting people all over the world coming to US to work and which in turn create more opportunities 

for the locals. Today's world is more "YOU AND ME", not "YOU OR ME".
