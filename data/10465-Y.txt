I strongly vote for the OPT extension for STEM majors. I am a graduate student in Statistics. People around me(most of whom are F1 students) came to the United States not only because of the high academic level but more important, for the fair and freedom in this land, the equality for each race, gender and background, and the spirit of inclusion and opportunity for all. When the OPT extension first came out, people like me all feel largely inspired. Since it means that we may have the chance to gain working experience in the most competitive companies or institutes of the world, and sit together with other brilliant minds to make amazing ideas, products and even the future. The original 1 year OPT is too short for science majors like statistics, computer science, and so on. Because a science project in such areas might need much more time to build the theoretical foundation, make it improved, and to verify its usefulness. Thus after one year, things may only just get started and then we have to leave. What a pity for both personal career and the country's long-term development! 

Therefore, I believe the OPT extension proposal will not only bring creativity and labor to the States, but also strengthen people's faith in the grand American dream.
