"OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year."

This is the same kind of thing I ran into in the tech (IT) field with H1-B visas pushed for years by Sens Kennedy and Spectre. Originally foreign workers were brought in response to big business pushing the impression of a "labor shortage" building up to and during Y2K. While there may have been TEMPORARY shortage during this period, the shortage was short-lived.

Employers quickly learned they could bring in relatively cheap foreign workers giving preference over qualified American workers. Each year, the quotas were increased with the jubilant support of Kennedy and Spectre.

Eventually, millions such as myself found ourselves out of work with little or no chance of resuming IT positions taken by the visas.

An indirect outcome of this failed program is, high school and college students soon began abandoning the IT and other tech fields because the once lucrative careers no longer existed - for Americans. This has lead to a real or imagined shortage of qualified candidates in the field. A sort of "self-fulfilled" prophecy.

The OPT program will devastate other tech jobs just like the H1-B visa program did to IT. The workers come, but they never leave. Result - millions more Americans out of work. From the cheap seats, it appears this is the government's end game. Let's not have any more expansion of OPT.
