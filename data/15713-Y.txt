I support the OPT STEM since it is a good rule to gather all the clever guys in the world to support US technology and keep US stay on the top level of the world. Think about the Master and Phd students from other countries. Most of Them need to study english and pass GRE, meanwhile they need good GPA to help them apply schools. As a result, most of them are top level guys in their own countries. Think about it, in 21 century, what is the most important? Persons! The persons who control the knowledge is the top one value in the world, and OPT STEM is the way to keep them in US!
