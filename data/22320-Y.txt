Both the H1B and OPT programs are a bad idea for the United States. I teach engineering courses and have recently acquired an MBA degree. In the former I have many foreign students. They are really no better than the US students but I see the US students struggling to get real jobs. Job fairs are only offering internships and companies are focusing on OPT. Good engineering jobs seem to be hard to come by. Regardless of all of this, the justification for OPT and/or H1Bs is a shortage of talent. I disagree with that greatly. It is all about reducing labor costs but that reduction leads to lower tax revenue for the government and our current woes. Offshoring is the other major related problem.
As a recent MBA graduate I look around at even getting a management position and that seems to be difficult. It does not bode well for the US and OPT and H1Bs are only going to make matters worse.
