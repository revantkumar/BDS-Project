I strongly support the STEM extension for the following reasons.

1. It retains the best talent, and the talent in need in the States. Please note that these foreign students are trained by American resources. It's unreasonable to improve people of other nations solely to send them back to competitors of US companies.

2. It saves the risks for US companies. Without STEM extension, US companies may spend tons of money and time to train the foreign new hires only to find out they have to let them go. We all know that it takes time to train someone on a new job. It would be a huge waste of resources if the US companies can't utilize these people after they've put in so much resources.

3. Competition is positive. No one wants to be in a warm house. You know those plants aren't actually stronger! In a global economy, how long can our US young folks hide from the world?
