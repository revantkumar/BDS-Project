I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension for F-1 students with STEM degrees. For F1 students, they spent years here in US studying for degrees like Masters and PhD, which can take up to 5 or 6 years, which is never a short period of time in their young life. Getting sufficiently accustomed to US culture and gaining enough training in specialized directions, these students are eligible to work in US industry or universities without any problem. It is pointless to let these highly-educated human resource leave US, which is a waste of educational resources, and a lost of US economy. These students with high education can MAKE money, more than they could've SPENT on themselves or their families. Also there are sufficient protections already for US citizens in exclusions of job positions and working visa issuance, so if US citizens CAN do better(or as good as) the F1 students, they should have greater opportunity to stand out. US society has the tradition to be open and competitive. It is the high standards of creativity, productivity and spirit of equal-opportunity that keep this nation advancing, so please don't sacrifice them!
