I think this proposal is very important and helpful to U.S., STEM students, employers, and the developing of the world. U.S. is the most developed country in the world; this extension of 24 months can more effectively attract TOP STEM students to study and work in the U.S. and make their contributions to the science and technology areas in the U.S. This will keep U.S. in the leading role of technologies and science. 

On the other hand, after the 24 months, some STEM students might choose to go back to their own countries and bring advanced knowledge and skills that they have acquired in the U.S. to help developing countries. This is also going to accelerate the developing of the world.
