I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. These international students with STEM degrees are usually top ones from their home country. Why don't we encourage them to stay and contribute to America. 
2. These students are filling the gap between demand and supply in the US job market. The companies hire international students not because they ask for low salaries. It's because the employers can't find enough qualified US citizens for the jobs. 
3. Competition makes US better. As I mentioned earlier, these international students are quite competitive, thus encourage American students to work harder. It's a good competition environment for both international students and American students.
