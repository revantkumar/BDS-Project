I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.
2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. US is comprised of diverse groups of immigrants from all over the world who together are building a united nation, which is a base of USA foundation
3. New immigration regulation does brings competition which is not a bad thing in terms of wellness of a society as a whole. It is believed that competition leads to efficiency. It is understood that the poor in classes is the major force to impede the process of new regulation as they are scared of competition and lose of jobs. But this thought just weaken this country which has been prosperous for the last century because of attraction of talents from everywhere without cares of past and origin. Please be open and you will be paid off at an unexpected payback
