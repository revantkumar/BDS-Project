Spence Shan As a Chinese graduate student in the first year of engineering major, I definitely support this rule.

Firstly, take my major, Architectural Engineering, as an example, most graduates are from foreign countries: India, China, Korea, Iran, etc. They basically work in building-energy-concerned company after graduation, trying to reduce the energy consumption in America. I have to say these foreign students and workers make great contributions to local improvement of energy use.

Secondly, statistics show that nearly 66% STEM students in America are foreigners, according to a Bookings report. If the OPT extension is rejected, most of foreign workers on their OPT have to leave America due to the lack of H1B,which would lead to great loss on technology and economy of America.

Thirdly, local Americans tend to choose careers like accountant, lawyer, medical worker, instead of STEM jobs. Most of them would like to work in a more challenging and flexible way, but not deal with fundamental theories and routines. So the extension of OPT is obviously not the obstacle of local employment.

Fourthly, what I regard as the most important is that as a country famous for its freedom and fairness, America should give all of us in this land equal chances as long as we have capabilities. We, no matter foreigners and locals, deserve it.
