This is a direct attack on U.S. citizen and legal resident STEM workers. Before the U.S. Government creates additional incentives to displace these workers it needs to fully investigate the massive abuse of current programs, especially the HB-1 visa programs. It also it needs to substantiate the narrative that the U.S. is deficient in STEM workers. Indeed, from the prevailing data I can gather, U.S. institutions of higher eduction graduate an annual surplus of STEM workers compared to available positions in the economy.

And it's personal for me as I have children going into STEM fields and one is a sophmore at Rice University with a 3.98 GPA in Computer Science. The industry and government narrative of a shortage of STEM workers was hammered into her and she responded by choosing a degree that she thought would be demand. Now, I'm afraid she's been sold a bridge to nowhere.
