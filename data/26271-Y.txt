I am in the support of the F-1 extension for STEM degrees students. 
The expanding training opportunity for F-1 non-immigrant students help the US company R&D, university and national lab keep the best intelligent researchers and scientists in US. They contribute significantly to making US the leader in the research and education in the world. Moreover, they pay taxes, contribute the US economy growth and also might create more jobs for new researcher in the field. If the STEM students have to leave after a year training, US might lose a large group of STEM F-1 smart, intelligent and ambitious students contributing to US economy growth and research development.
