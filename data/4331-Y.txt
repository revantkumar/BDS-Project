F-1 students with STEM degrees have been helping the growth of US economy for many years. They always demonstrate exceptional abilities and skills in their respective area when there is a shortage of US workers. The previous 17-month OPT extension rule does not have negative impact on US workers' compensation and benefits because:
1. Most of US companies only hire foreign F-1 students when there are no qualified US workers. F-1 students require continuous sponsorship from their employer to continue working in US and thus are not the preferred candidates when there are qualified US workers for the position.
2. There is no evidence that F-1 students in STEM degrees have lower average compensation than equivalent US workers.
3. By hiring F-1 students in STEM area, many US companies will grow faster and create more job opportunities for US workers.
I strongly support the new OPT extension rule, as it would smooth the employment process of F-1 students and help maintaining a healthy economy growth for the United States.
