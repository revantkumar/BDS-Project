I am an employee who is currently working in Motorola Solutions. I have joined the company for half year and OPT allows me to have a chance getting H1B next year. As an electronic engineer, I learned a lot during this period and I am anticipating to donating more to the company. I believe OPT is a triple-win thing. For students, we can have chance learning from experienced engineers. For company, new and young employee could bring energy to the company and for the country, it could attract more good youngsters, and keep on being the cradle for people who innovates the world.
