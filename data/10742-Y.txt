I think the proposal will definitely do good to the US. As everyone in the world knows that the US is a country who provides people equal chance to work. Nowadays, as the number of foreign students growing bigger, it is a good chance for the US to get talented students. It is a good idea to have more different culture and different thoughts students to work here which will absolutely make this country more creative. So I strongly agree with this proposal.
