Candice Su I totally agree with the 24month extension and I hope this rule can be settled down finally. 
As an international student who just started working in states, I've been through some unfair competition since a lot of 
Companies don't hire non-citizens. So it's not easy for us to find a job and we really want to have longer practical training period before we go back to our country for further career development. I know some of us may stay, if they are lucky enough 
to get H1B or green card, but we all know that's a small portion of the international students. Most of us chose American universities because of the opt training period and went back to our country at the end of OPT.

So I don't think the fact that students get longer opt extension will affect domestic labor, not to mention the long list of career opportunities that are only opened to citizens. And as to the argument that foreign students accept lower wages in order to stay here, I think that's not the real case. We stay for practical training and better opportunities as the start of our careers. We didn't lower the wages, neither did us cause unfair competition to local labor.
