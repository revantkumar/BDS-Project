Saranya Sankar I strongly support the new F-1 visa STEM OPT extension proposal to expand employment and training opportunities via this ruling. As someone who works in laboratories in order to manufacture, synthesize and develop drugs for human consumption, or lotions for human skin application. Anything that touches your body or goes inside your body, has to pass through several stages of development from conceptualization to research and development, pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutical to kinetic studies of how it will hit the target, up to rigorous quality analysis and FDA tests before it goes out to market. 

The way drugs are developed is with long hours and tight schedules, while maintaining quality and utmost safety in labs. I am glad and am proud to have worked in laboratories producing advancements in cancer research and pharmacological science.
The coursework and practical research focus in labs has helped me put out journal papers in a short span of time, under the guidance of professors, fellow graduate students and post-doctoral students. With the new STEM ruling, and mandates for protection and regulations for employers, the scenario is likely to spring up more research and significant advancements in Science.
