From the aspect of social economics, this proposal seems a beneficial one in long term. Indeed the prolonged OPT will increase international students' chances to get employed, which will make job hunting more intense to Americans. However, this is the most effective way for the employers and the country to recruit talented people, and in the long run, these people may push the nation forward then increase the quality of every American people. For example, which one do you think contribute to our society more, whealthys or poors? Of course the whealthys, because they must have done something better to get their positions. Imagine what will happen if we kick out all of them and give the poors a better life and only allow them to lead the country, then what? The total wealth of the country will increase faster? Remember, winners never complains. I prefer someone more eligible and more effective to do the job. Nothing personal, but they s is not a good time to show our mercy, we need more elites to keep the nation stand out.
