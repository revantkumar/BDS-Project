Currently I am a software engineer in an IT company in United States using my OPT. I strongly agree to DHS proposal about 24 months OPT extension for F-1 nonimmigrant student with STEM degrees.
Before I came to pursue my graduate degree in United States, I have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension, and that is why I choose United State rather than Canada for my Graduate study. DHS must therefore act swiftly to mitigate the uncertainly surrounding the 2008 IFR. The proposal is not only for the U.S. academic sector that can remain competitive globally, but also for the future of those students who participate in practical training in STEM fields to advance their careers.
