I think it is definitely a good idea to extend the opt. I have a very good India friend who is a phd in computer science, if he can only stay 7months after graduation, I don't think any employers will consider give him a chance and he will have to go back to India immediately. BUT our country need such talented genius to stay, to help build up the society. An extension to 24 months is absolutely necessary!
