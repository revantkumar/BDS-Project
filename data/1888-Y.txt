I strongly support the OPT expansion and the Cap-Gap Relief. I hope the following points to be considered.
1. As a Ph.D student sponsored by my department, I know that huge amounts of dollars are invested in F-1 students in education. The OPT extension and Cap-Gap relief provide a nice opportunity for us to return the favor and contribute to the advances in science and technology in America. It would be a shame if a large number of foreign students with advanced education had to leave due to tightening of immigration regulations.
2. The OPT and Cap-Gap extensions have stimulated healthy competitions in high-tech industries in America. The healthy competitions attract talents from around the world to America, and make the American high-tech industries the most prosperous in the world. If these immigration-friendly policies were cancelled, American high-tech companies would severely suffer from loss of talent.
