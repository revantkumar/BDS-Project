I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Especially for stem major, because that's what international students are good at. 

2. We are making contribution to the American economy, and we believe this is a mutual beneficial proposal. 

3. For anyone who says this OPT hurts the employments for US citizens, ask all the recruiters in any company you know, would anyone prefer a international student rather than a native one? NO, not to mention the visa and many other troubles they are facing when hiring an international student. But they still do, because no native fits their requirements!

I don't think this proposal has anything wrong. For those who cannot find a job, please don't blame international students, simply because those are not qualified.
