hongyu liu I support this OPT extension policy. First, I once saw a report from US NEWS "Short on STEM Talent". The link is below: http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real So there is no denying that STEM international student will provide much drive for decreasing the shortness of STEM students. So there should be a extension of OPT. "STEM skills drive innovation" The link is below : http://www.adeccousa.com/employers/resources/Pages/infographic-stem-skills-are-driving-innovation.aspxWithout doubt , F-1 STEM students have been major force in many high-tech companies and industry . So without OPT extension there will be less and less innovation. Also those talented STEM F1 students will bring much profit for the American employers which urgently need STEM international students to work for them. Based on above, we need to support the OPT extension policy.
