I vote for this OPT extension legislation. I believe that, in the long term, it will benefit not only the technology industry but also help keeping America its leading power in the world. I understand it may conflict with the interests of some US born Americans, but what these people stand on, is vulnerable. The H1B cap does not change. Even if they have a little bit more time (actually it is merely 7 months more than the original 17-month extension), they can not win in the lottery of every April's H1B lottery, so the impact of OPT extension on the job market is very limited.
