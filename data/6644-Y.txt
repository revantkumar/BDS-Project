I'm international student majoring in engineering at Purdue Univeristy. I'm participating in co-op program in my undergraduate program. When I was working there, lots of my projects were scheduled from 3 years to 5 years. In my 4-session co-op, I had couple projects that I continued working on them in my different working session in past 2 years and the time span of these projects were more than 3 years. If I didn't have OPT extension, all my working would be meaningless and it was huge lose to company as well because they would lost the engineer in charge of that project. Furthermore, the majority projects for full-time employee would have longer time span than project for co-ops. In this aspect, OPT extension would be more essential to company and to student. 

on the other aspect of story, international students are graduately becoming powerful consumers. For example, last year, I saw that more than 50% consumers of Black Friday at Tippecanoe Mall of Lafayette, IN were international students. They would not choose come to United States if they don't have OPT extension and cannot get a job after graduate. At least, the reason why all my friends and I would be at United State is that I can get a job after my undergrad/grad program.
