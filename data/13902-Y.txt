I think it's a really good initiative by itself. The government can attract more and more promising and highly intellectual students all around the world to stay in the country and encourage them to contribute to the recovery and revitalization of the economy since last recession. This is especially important for the high-tech companies where a majority of employers are international foreigners. Such initiative would definitely give them more opportunities and good reasons to continue to work in the US and bring in resultant benefits to both the companies and the country.
