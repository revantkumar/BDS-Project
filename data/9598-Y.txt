I strongly support the new rule. As we all know, the US become the most powerful country because its diverse population and attitude towards emigrants. The US allows everyone to pursue their own dream no matter where they are from. Actually,international students, especially those with STEM OPT,considerably contributes to the high-tech industry of USA.For example, without them the IT enterprises wouldn't hire enough employees so that they would have to outsource their partial business. Consequently, the US government would lose a considerable amount of tax revenue which helps to improve the welfare of US citizens.If the US still wants to keep its prosperity, I cannot find a fair reason for it to say no to this new policy.
