I oppose the DHS proposed rule extension of the OPT. For starters, anything of this nature should be coming from Congress
where the representatives can be held accountable by their constituents. We have many problems associated with the 
overstay of visas, yet this asks for more of the same. We continually hear we need to train our students for STEM based
jobs, yet this actually discriminates against our own STEM-trained students seeking employment. That contributes to their
unemployment and therefore their inability to pay off student loans. It contributes to our failing economy. It is un-American.
