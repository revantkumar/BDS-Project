We should keep the OPT extension for the foreign students in STEM program. 

First, you can't ignore the contributions this group has made to US society. They work hard to make innovations and work on the solutions to serve this country. They're not disposable, contrarily, they are just the same human as American citizens. They deserve the equal opportunities, and employment should only be based on the objective criteria, rather than discrimination. 

Second, there are a lot of benefits for keeping the transnational connections and global links. US should take the lesson from the countries which close themselves and refuse to accept new blood into their society. The whole society will lose the vitality.

Third, the people who launched this kind of anti-immigrant instigation have malicious intentions. The right thing they should do is to work hard as the foreign students to improve themselves, rather than waiting for good luck will drop to them without any pain efforts. They are so pathetic! Go fight in the right way! Don't waste the time and energy of every one to handle your vulnerability.
