Jenny Wu I strongly support the extension of OPT for STEM students. I work in a global company, and my department mainly focuses on technology support for our internal clients. Most employees are immigrates. Not to say Americans are not as smart as us, just they may not have the passion to do research in universities and thus lack the technology background to support them to work in R&D department. We are the main driving force of improving production, we are the people who are willing to spend all the time to do the high level work which Americans are not that interested. We are not asking protection of the job opportunity, we just want the basic approval of OPT extension. Without us, US will loss thousands of smart people with high degree, do you still think that is a good thing for US in the future?
