kelly zhang strongly agree to extend the OPT for STEM major student!
Here is some ideals come from my mind!

1. In many industries especially the IT industry , international students makes up the majority of the population. If they do not have longer OPT , they have to leave US and then make a huge loss to the company and the whole industry!

2.They can make more hiring opportunities for native people. Many of international people are very smart and they will open their own company and their company will produce more job opportunity to native people

3.They are the signal of "american dream"!! They also make US history and they are representations of the "american dream" and that's why our country is so strong !
