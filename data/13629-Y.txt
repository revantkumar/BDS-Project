I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1.The country that offers the international students opportunities to study here should also offer them the opportunities to work here for at least 3 years. International students pay higher tuition fees than native students, they do deserve getting some working experience here. A good and expensive education should not only pass on the knowledge,but also give people environment to know how to use it. Longer working time is meaningful to both international students and the United States. High quality education is a card of this county, we should not ruin it.
2. Diversity is the key reason that the United States leads the world. We need people from different culture and education backgrounds to help the development of technology .
