To whom it may concern, I am a legal immigrant who is now a naturalized American citizen. My loyalties lie with the U.S. and its Constitutional provisions. I am very concerned about recent efforts to provide foreign students with resources and privileges that should be reserved for U.S. citizens.

Additionally, it appears that to provide these foreign students with unearned benefits the government (OPT) has to denies U.S. STEM graduates and degrade the following programs:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

Please reconsider the changes to the OPT program and keep it to its original purpose, Americans need all the help they can get to survive in the current economic climate (92 million Americans not working).

Sincerely,

Luiz F. Da Silva
