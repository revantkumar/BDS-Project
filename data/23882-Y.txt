I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.

A program, especially in STEM field, always takes a long time to accomplish. And it would mess up the whole program if one of the team members was forced to leave because of the expiration of OPT. And many STEM students need career training before they take some specific work. Companies cost a lot for the training and with a longer OPT extension, those people who get training can work for a longer period of time and contribute more to companies and American's GDP. 

And the best part in the proposal as far as I concerned is the Mentoring and Training Plan. It require employers to implement formal mentoring to augment students' academic learning through practical experience. That's not only good for international student but also American students! Companies should take the duty to give students more chance to practice and contribute to industries with what then have learned.

Moreover, I DO NOT think the proposal may harm American students. The first reason is that many companies CAN NOT employ sufficient employees if they only enroll American students. Many Americans are not that into STEM job. The second reason is that the proposal requires companies to employ people with equity. That's really an important point and DHS should surveillance on companies.
