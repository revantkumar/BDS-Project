I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
For one thing, diversity is important for any countries, especially for America. The achievement of America would be accessible without people from all around the world. America owns the best education in the world, which attracts excellent students from other countries to study. When they graduate, the proposal provides a good chance for them to make contributions to U.S.. Without the proposal, many excellent students have to come back their countries, a huge loss for U.S..
In Addition, competition does exist, but it is a good thing. We all know that people are unlikely to make a progress without competition. If there is no competition for U.S. citizens, they might have no impetus to improve themselves. If so, how can America keep developing steadily with a large number of citizens without impetus?
