Chandler Winnis Many negative comments point out that STEM OPT students are big competitors for American citizens in job searching. I dont think this is the case. They act like that OPT students and Americans are competing for a fixed number of jobs in the market. Actually, companies, as well as whole job market, will grow when more capital and labors are added. Since USA already has a mature economic system, the effect caused by adding capital should be much smaller than that of adding labors. Increasing number of skilled STEM workers to US industries, especially high-tech industry, will help companies grow bigger and bring the needs for more employees. It is a much more positive way to solve unemployment problem than just asking international students go home at the sacrifice of economic expansion.
