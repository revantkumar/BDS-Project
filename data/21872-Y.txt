I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. It is American spirit to give everyone an equal chance. Talented students who come to the U.S., looking for further education deserve opportunities to practice their skills after graduation.
2. It is positive for the U.S. economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area.
3. Longer OPT will be more attractive for more students coming to study in the U.S.
