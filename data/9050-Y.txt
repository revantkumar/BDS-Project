OPT extension is very important for U.S. High-tech industry. Without OPT extension for STEM students, many High-tech companies would have hard time recruiting and maintaining new employees. Under current competitive H1B lottery, about half new employees have to leave their position only due to visa problem. Those companies paid a lot to train the new international employees but half of them need to go after one year. That will increase labor cost for high-tech companies significantly. It would undermine the leading role of U.S. high-tech industry.
