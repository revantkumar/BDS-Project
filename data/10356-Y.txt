The OPT provides a chance for international student as a stepping stone into the industry. It also helps the students to find the area of interest to work as they start to work. It would be great help for present students as well as future students if the OPT period has extended to 24 months. This is allow them to work for some more time in the United States. This can help us in knowing industry standards,leveraging skills. my request for the United States government is to make sure that this rule is passed helping more F-1 students.
