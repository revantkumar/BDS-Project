I strongly support this rule. Any rules that can attract high-tech talents should be carried out. F-1 students with STEM degrees usually possess the knowledge that fits the need of high-tech companies. As the power of US is mainly based on high technology, hence it's quite important to keep these high-tech talents stay and this can boost the economy of US. It will be a great loss for US if lots of talented students leave this land just because there is not enough support. 
Also, this rule can make the human resource more competitive. As there are fewer local Americans pursuing advanced degrees in STEM than international students, international students can be a supplement to the workforce. Usually, these new graduates need to apply for H1-B to work in US. However, there are only limited amount of H1-B issued each year. The loss of hiring companies can be reduced if their employee couldn't get H1-B since they can still work for about 3 years under this new rule.
