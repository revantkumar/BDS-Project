I strongly support the proposed rule. As a current employee in a tech company, I see how eager the company is looking for talented people. The company always try their best to make the recruiting process fair and efficient in order to select needed talents, so it is ridiculous to claim that hiring the foreign STEM students makes Americans' harder to get a job. Most of the STEM students are smart and hard-working. With certain number of STEM students hired under the current OPT policy, most companies (especially tech companies) are still under staffed, not to mention how these companies will be affected if all such employees are deported from the States. BTW, as far as I know, the STEM students was paid the same as US workers in my field. Moreover, the talented STEM employees are contributing tax to IRS, and creating more revenues to the US economy, which is eventually creating more job opportunities in the US. 

In addition, the H1-B lottery is another reason why we need the STEM OPT extension rule. This proposed OPT rule will offer those who didn't get selected in the lottery another chance to work and gain practical experience. Hard to imagine how the job marketing will be if no OPT extension is offered any more. 

Thanks for your time and consideration.
