I am so glad to hear this great news! I think this will benefit both America citizens and international graduate students. 
STEM is very important for to the U.S.'s Economic Future. (Ref: http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2012/06/15/stem-education-is-the-key-to-the-uss-economic-future). 
With more great international graduate working for US, I believe, there will also be more companies established and more job opportunities for both US Citizens and international workers.
