As an American employer, and former U.S. college graduate, I cannot understand why any branch of the United States government would propose a program that puts foreign workers/students/immigrants ahead of American-born workers/students and previously naturalized citizens. Also, since tuition continues to rise, how will American-born college graduates be able to compete with foreign students, as moist of these students receive a disproportionate level of financial aid, as it relates to their overall college education and debt?

1. That said, I would like to have your office explain, in detail, how this proposed program will effect the American-born and native workers in The United States.

2. For what specific purpose is this program being proposed?

3. How will this proposed program effect the unemployment rate of the American-born workforce (previously defined above)?

4. How will this proposed program effect the American-born college graduate trying to gain employment, at a pay level that allows a higher-than-average quality of life, and still pay the debt of a college degree, or degrees?

5. Since there is much talk about the 'Student Loan Bubble', please provide specific details that explain how this program will effect this potential issue? As you may already know, if the USA has one more down-turn in the economy, considering it's still frail recovery, many of the student loan institutions (e.g. Sallie Mae, ACS and National Education, etc.), will necessarily either be 'rescued' by the federal government, using Real-American's tax dollars, or go out-of-business due to bankruptcy. Why would the any branch of the American government put a program like this up for consideration?

Please Advise in Detail,
