I strongly support the OPT extension.
1) International students choose US colleges because US can provide more professional training programs. If the OPT extension got cancelled, the attractiveness of US colleges would decrease. And since international students make a lot of contributes to the income of US colleges' revenue, I do think it is necessary to pass the OPT extension rule.
2) High Tech companies are always the engine to drive US's economy. High Tech companies always need best engineers in the world to keep the advance to companies in other countries. If the OPT extension got cancelled, US will lose some of the best engineers in the world who would make contribution to US's economy. If US still want to be the leading power of the the world, a more open attitude to people from the other country would be necessary.
3) I found people are really afraid that US citizens will lose their jobs in all the industries. However, I don't think they have to worry about this at all. Because OPT extension is for STEM only which means the rule only applies in limit areas that really need excellent people from all around the world. That is the reason why US is the most powerful country in the would. I do not think this will cause competition to most of the US citizens.
To summarize, I really think OPT extension would benefit US's economy, and keep US the leading power of the world.
