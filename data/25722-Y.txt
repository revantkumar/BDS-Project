I strongly support the new proposal. Freedom for a market to have competition will definitely increase the efficiency and productivity for the USA in a long term, and the incoming STEM students not only are likely to make more contribution for the USA itself, but also unlikely to take over the job opportunities of most American citizens because of the difference in their searching job types. Moreover, being the largest liberal migrating country in the world, the USA needs to attract new vitality from the world and maintain its diversity as to stay competitive. Now either NASA's plan for revitalization of Mars or the advanced field in Physics that tries to find dark matter requires large amount of scholars, engineers and mathematicians to work on the task, so the 24-month STEM OPT extension is a wise choice indeed for the future of the USA.
