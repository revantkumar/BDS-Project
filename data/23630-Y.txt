I strongly support this decision for the following reason:
1. It is the immigrant-friendly culture has made American the best country in the world.
2. The new rules will attract more foreign students to study at USA , and will bring more tuition fee to US economy .
3. The student who can get OPT is the talent student among the foreign students . It is good for American companies to employ these talent students . The longer the OPT , the more value these talent students will create for American company.
