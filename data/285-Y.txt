I highly support the extension of OPT not only it benefits to refine the Federal law regarding to show a fully respect to different culture, but also the social contribution from students from China and India is significant today especially in technology field. By extending the OPT, there will be more foreigner students show the will to invest the education in the U.S. which contributes a lot to the economic benefits in academic institution.
