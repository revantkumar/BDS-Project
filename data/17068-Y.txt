Increasing the STEM extension period to 24 months is a great step towards retaining international talent which not only helps the US economy but also gives hope to those students who want to remain in the US. That being said, I do agree that a 36 month extension, instead, would be more beneficial towards the end goal of being able to implement that talent towards growth of the industry.
