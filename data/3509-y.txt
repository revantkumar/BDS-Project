Honghui Yu I strongly support the STEM opt extension rule. The rule can attract more international students to study and work in USA. International students contribute to GDP of US. Statistics show that in 2009 roughly 182,000 foreign graduates of U.S. colleges and universities would have raised the gross domestic product (GDP) by roughly $13.6 billion. Without opt extension rule, many international students cannot work in USA any more, which would be a disaster for USA economy. Thus, the opt extension rule needs to be approved as soon as possible.
