Bryan Griffith Please support this proposed rule change. These well educated and highly motivated individuals should be welcome in this country for as long as they wish to stay. In fact, making them permanent residents would benefit our country greatly. All of the arguments against this rule are xenophobic and lack any basis in science, and statistics.
