I support this proposal. As an international student in the US, I really hope that I can have a chance to work in this country and gain some experience in my studied area. I believe that international students like me will help to accelerate the development of technology area as we are so passionate and devoted to work. 24 months stem extension rule can give us a better chance to display our talent. The US companies will also benefit from it as we will help them develop products and technology. In addition, fast development of technology will create more jobs which is good for the US.

Besides, the proposed rule will attract more talents international students to the US and help the development of the US University and colleges which are very important for US to improve higher education around the country.
