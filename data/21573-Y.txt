I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.

Someone who objects the extension of OPT say that foreign students take away jobs and do not pay tax. As a non-resident alien , I can firmly say foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX (much more than us residents) and they help local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge loss. The business like apartments, food services and other industries will face huge loss.

U.S. will suffer from tremendous financial loss by revoking old STEM OPT rule and failing to publish new one. 

Foreign students are paying large amount of tuitions to colleges, which is supporting the universities financially. After paying this large amount of money, how can you cruelly take away their opportunity to work in US?
