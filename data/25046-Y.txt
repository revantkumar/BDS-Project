As a prospective graduate student in the United States, I firmly agree with the regulation enacted by HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT stating that the OPT is going to be extended by 24 months instead of previous 17 months. This could be a huge chance for students like me to enhance practical ability to a large degree rather than just obtaining knowledge in the academic settings. I extremely need this policy to pave way for my professional life. Plus, I think the policy would also benefit the scientific and engerneering circle in the United States reciprocally. As a matter of fact, a country on the basis of internationalization and cutting-edge science and technology is supposed to embrace a policy like that.
