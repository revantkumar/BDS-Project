Thank you so much for your proposal. As a dependent of a STEM student, I find the extension of STEM opt a very wise decision. 

My spouse graduates from a ivy league school and works in a high tech company here in Silicon Valley. Like many other foreign young engineers here, he is highly skilled at software languages and loves what he does so much. I see him working up to midnight 7 days a week for a launching of new product and he loves it. 

Yes, he sometimes complains about the high apartment rent and taxes in California, but he still finds Silicon Valley the best place on this planet for developing his skills and realizing his dream of applying his skills to change the world. An extension on OPT will provide young engineers with dreams like him with more opportunities to contribute to the society. 

Thank you so much for the proposal. I support the new rule.
