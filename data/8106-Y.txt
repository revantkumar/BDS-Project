I always believe that America Spirit is Equality and Diversity. It's short-sighted to against this rule just for thinking if there're less foreigner then more Americans will have a job. But think about this, why some foreigners can be more competitive than some Americans? Hard-working and great people will be appreciated no matter they are foreigners or American. So if you are good enough, you don't need to try to keep foreigners out to raise the possibility of getting a job. We need more talents and hard-working people to build the America Dream, no matter if they are American or not.
