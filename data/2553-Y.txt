Theresa Young International students bring money, skills and jobs in USA. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM. Many jobs are going unfilled simply for lack of people with the right skill sets. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A.
