I've looked through many comments addressing that OPT - extension are giving away Americans' job to foreigners. I found that untrue from many prospective.

The prosperity of the US is closely related to innovation and technology. The OPT-extension will attract best engineers and scientists to this country. The implementation of great ideas and skills brings in a lot of investment, which will in return create more jobs, for everyone in this country. Think about how many engineers who benefit from OPT-extension are working in Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc. Can you imaging live without products from these companies now? The booming of technologies has also stimulated other industries.

America has been the most powerful country based on its openness to best talents. I can't imagine it becoming a inaccessible place for brilliant people, not to mention the buffer fly effect if doing so.
