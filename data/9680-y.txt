Kiran Rokkam Dear DHS,

It is very glad to see that STEM extension is increased from 17 months to 24 months. It is really helpful retain the skilled employees in the US. 
Unless there is an STEM extension, US will loose the lot of young talented people graduated from different STEM disciplines to other countries. It is very important to have the STEM extension continued to compete with the rest of the world in Technology innovations. 

I strongly agree with this proposal and I thank DHS and Immigration department to take this up as priority. 

Thanks 
Kiran Rokkam
