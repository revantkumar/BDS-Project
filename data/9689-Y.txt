I strongly support the proposal to change the STEM Extension from 17 month to 24.

I am now working as an Industrial Engineer in Plainfield Indiana. 5 years ago, I came to US for College education. My parents spent all their savings to paid my tuition. They had tried everything to provide me the best education, that we believe in. Thanks to the opportunity of OPT Extension, which allow me work in the US now. However, even with the 17 months STEM Extension, many students just like me still cannot get the H1B Visa. If the STEM extension can be 24 months, it will provide 1 more chance to a lot of people just like me. Hope this will work out. 

This proposal is not just about time, it is about live.
