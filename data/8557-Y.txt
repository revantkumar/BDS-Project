I'm totally agree with this regulation, not only because I'm myself an international STEM student, but also this regulation benefits American people as well.

I understand some people submit comment saying international students makes the unemployed Americans rate higher, this seems reasonable at one glance, but actually it's not that related.

I believe every STEM employer treats international student and local students equally, it is our excellence that help us get the offer, and our excellence is not an excuse for others to say this is unfair. If somebody says it's unfair, it should be us, as we don't have the equal opportunities as Americans.

I personally always believe that among all the countries in the world, U.S. is definitely one of the countries that truly respect and accept the diversity. This diversity attracts international students to come to U.S. for better education; this diversity makes the company grow faster and improve the performance; thus, this diversity benefits all American people as they are consumers and producers in society.

Everyone should repect the equal employment which creats a sound cycle between employees and employers, otherwise company profits will be compromised rather than improved, and I believe we all know who will be the victims if all these companies have to compromise.
