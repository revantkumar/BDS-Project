I strongly SUPPORT this the proposal because competition exists no matter where are the talented people are. In this era of GLOBALIZATION, it is impossible to keep your job just by rejecting foreigners. Thin about it, if all these hardworking and talented students have to go back to their countries, they will excellently serve their companies and countries. Then these countries will have better industries, better educations, and overall, better economy. When these countries become more competitive than US, industries shrank and Americans still lose their jobs. People find a job and enjoy a good life by learning and struggling, not by escaping from competition!
The proposal is giving the extended permit to someone deserves it, not anyone. And these talented people can definitely promote the boom in different areas in US. These people do not ruin the lives of Americans, instead, they make them better by making this country better. It was corroborated by the history for countless times.
