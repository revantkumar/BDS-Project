I strongly support the extension of OPT for F1 students. I believe that in the E-verified companies, equal payment should be received by both US STEM students and F1 STEM students. So why would a company give the job opportunity to a foreign student who might face visa issues sooner or later instead of giving it to a stable US citizen? Unless the foreign students are much talented and can potentially bring more economic growth to the company (I believe there is only a small amount of F1 STEM students can be this good). On one hand that the F1 students earned the training opportunity by their talent and hard-working, I think they deserve it. On the other hand, I believe this competition is a great opportunity for the US STEM students/workers to discover more of their potential talent and maximize their personal values to the companies. 

Overall,
1.Competition is not a bad thing, it brings excellent people in the US and all over the world to keep the advancement of STEM majors in the US. 
2.Talented F1 students will benefit the economic growth of US companies, and the companies will remain competitive globally. 
3.As the economic growth continues, more job opportunities will be generated and more US citizens will be needed.
4.Creation is one of the most powerful tools in the STEM field, which can be significantly improved by diversity, the merged thoughts from different ways of thinking bred by different cultures.
