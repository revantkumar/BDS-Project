I totally support this politics! First, it is beneficial for American economy in a big picture. This kinda of jobs need a lot of creative and hardworking people. Those industry companies need a lot of foreign graduate students. Also, if students gain more experience in opt program, it is easier for them to find a job after going back to their own country. In this way, more and more students will be willing to persue a degree in United States, their tuition is also a great amount of money to develop American education and economy.
