Wang Amy As an onlooker,I think the revolution can not only bring more opportunities to those nonimmigrant students,but also benifit the development of America.It can help those talent students have opportunity to create more wealth by their wisdom.I think we shoud not worry about those people who claim that this revolution will threaten job opportunities for American people.As far as I am concerned,this concern can not stand by point.what a country or a society need is atalented person,rather than a paricular person from a particular country.if person is talented enough,why does he worry that his job will be carried off by a graduate student?
In a word,I am for this revolution.I hope this bill could be passed.
