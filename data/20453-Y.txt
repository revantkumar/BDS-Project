I support the proposal strongly. 
First of all, America is the immigration country and the best country in the world. One of the most important reason for her to become world leader in every field is because its diversities. Diversities stems new ideas and innovation. We know that innovation is the most important factor in development. It is true for companies as well as a country! For instance, successful companies like Google, Apple, Facebook are all among the most innovative companies. STEM international students have various ideas they are fully prepared to fulfill after they graduate from school and the only way to make their voice heard and make a difference is through work during their OPT period. The longer the OPT period they are given, the larger the chance of them bringing their uniqueness into their work and thus give more freshness and innovations into America. 

Second, STEM students are the major power in information era. Losing them equals losing power. Most of the STEM students in their OPT are looking to immigrate to US and build their own career and family in US and most importantly they came to US to make their American Dream come true. They are among the most hard working people and the people that bring most benefit to their work as well as to the country. 

Last but not least, some people would appose the idea of bringing more immigrant to the country. But the history has told us, closing door of a country means isolation, isolation means being left behind, which would lead to a definite lose. On the contrary, bringing more immigrant means more challenge, more challenge means better quality, better quality would lead to a best result! 

All in all, improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 non-immigrant student with STEM Degree and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students is the right choice for future of America.
