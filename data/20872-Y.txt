I think it's necessary to extend the OPT. 
The U.S. is a open country which welcome all the talented people around the world. People from different places with different cultures live and love this country. This is why it becomes strong. A country which be afraid of challenges and refuse to open will never develop. Now many other country are trying their best to keep and attract more talented and hard working people in their land in order to be stronger than the U.S. Why should America gives those people away instead of using them to develop American industry? Does the America wants to see that people learn useful things from American universities and make contributions to other countries? If that is true, after several years, even no one wants to study in America.
