I strongly support the proposal. 

1.The government has put great effort and invested a lot in higher education. If students who learned from U.S. university have to go back to their country because their OPT are too short and do not have enough time to explore their career in the U.S., it is a pity for our society. They should be allowed to stay and continue to contribute to the U.S.. After all, one of U.S. advantages is that U.S. utilizes international intellectual resources so it can keep leading in various industries for almost 50 years. 

2. This 24-month extension OPT is a great chance to let students to decide whether they will develop their career in U.S. or not. Studying life is totally different from working life. Although international students have spent years studying in the U.S., working in this country is new to them. The extension OPT will give them a great opportunity to let them decide where to stay by U.S. job market. It is a shame that those graduates, who may be talented in certain fields, have to go back to their country because of their OPT expiration. 

3. International students who has higher education degree can improve U.S. job market. Competition does exist and will exist if U.S. society want to select better people for a position. Some americans may argue that international students have already taken or will take over their jobs. But from what I can see, "take over" may not be the appropriate phrase. "Excel" may be a better. Employers always look for people who performs better regardless their races, religion, etc. . So job market will grow better, sending the right people to the right place. Those who lose the battle can reinvest themselves by further education, self-improving and come back to market fighting again. The U.S. job market will be better eventually regardless of international students. International students just accelerate the refining process. 
So I support this proposal strongly.
