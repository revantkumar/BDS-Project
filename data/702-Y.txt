Chandra Kanth Bandi I support the new rule for OPT Stem Extension for 2 years. Being an international student, it would benefit me. But above all the international students, it is the United States that would be benefited. Increase in the OPT Stem Extension period will increase the economy of the US. Each International Masters student contribute around 50,000$ through college fees for their study. Apart from the college tuition, application for H1B Visa for each masters amount to 2000$ per student. As of today there are 250,000 international student entering the US for their study. Decrease in the number will decrease the economy of US. 

I would like to mention that due to the international student, the culture of US will not get affected. This rule is not against any American citizen who are all protected by the updated rule.

Decreasing the Stem Extension Period would drive the international students towards European countries where the tuition fees is very less compared to the US and the period of study is for one year. If the Stem Extension period is removed, close to 80,000 students have to leave the US by February, 2016 and this will plummet the industrial sector due to the decrease in skilled labor. 

I would like to say that this updated rule will be a boon for all of us, the internationals students and the Americans.
