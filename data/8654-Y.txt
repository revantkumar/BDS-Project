I'm a STEM student and currently working in a company with my OPT period. I planned to apply my extension in this month and H1B visa next year. 

HR manager in my company said he doesn't understand why government limits talents from other countries to be part of this nation but legalized a huge amount of Mexican refugees, theft and drug smuggler. I'm with him actually. I assum government knows how important STEM extension is for the theology companies which are hiring a lot of employees on the OPT period. 

I'm 100% positive that 24 month extension will not be a great thing for the students but also a benefits for those who want to fight for their dream in this nation.
