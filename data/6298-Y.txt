Subject : In Strong Support for the NEW OPT STEM RULE

Dear Mr. Johnson:

I read the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for
F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students and I strongly support the Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months

I am Graduate from University of Houston Clear lake where there are so many Graduate students who are based international origin will benefit if this rule comes into existence and will be severely get effected badly if this rule comes in jeopardy.

I am on OPT STEM 17 and would be glad If I can be the part of the 24 month rule so I can learn more and gain extensive real time experience.

I really appreciate DHS for working quickly to prepare this new proposed rule and trying hard to make this work.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Thanks
Nikitha Reddy Guduru
