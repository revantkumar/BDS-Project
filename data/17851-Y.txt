Cool rule. America is a diversified country who attracts talents and benefits from the culture diversity. This open culture attracts many international students pursue their degrees here. They pay tuition fee to school; pay rent to native citizens; buy cars and spend money for living, their parents come to America to visit them and travel around. All these expense contribute to University revenue and local economic. 

Opt extension is one of the reason they choose America. They can have the opportunity to practice their skills and what they have learnt in America. Some projects need 3-4 years, one year opt is obviously not enough. 

For American citizen, they are worried international students will take jobs away. But this is not correct. American citizens are welcomed in the job market all the time. You can search in the internet; a lot of companies do not hire international students. They cannot find job easily. In some industries, for example IT, Insurance, etc., qualified workers are in high demands; native students cannot meet the high demand. Only in these fields, international students would get jobs with a litter bigger possibility. Competition dose exist, but it is not a bad thing. It is helpful to the development of any industries. I do not think the situation which very few Americans lose jobs would be change if all international students go away. You cannot blame international students when someone loses a job. International students are not receiving lower wage as what you thought and they pay tax and living expense. 

This new rule would be benefit to both America and International students. Please approve it.
