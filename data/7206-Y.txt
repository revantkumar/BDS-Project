I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. They are top talents who really can contribute to the society in multiple fields. Every year, the educational income from international students supports the US. universities/schools a lot (actually i think it is more that 27B/year). If the proposal does not get approved, you'll not be surprised to see the downturn for not only U.S. education, but also economy.
