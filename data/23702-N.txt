This act is criminal against unemployed hard working Americans that WANT and NEED a job. Our Labor Participation Rate 
is at a low not seen in four decades. It's time to apply some Tough Love to those that represent us, the hard working 
Patriot American voter. No more Mister Nice Guy. Get some back bone and cojones and quit bowing to Obummer 
and his minions, drones and sheeple.
