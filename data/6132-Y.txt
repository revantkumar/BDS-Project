I think this is an extremely important act and I cannot hold any more positive opinions about this issue. Take myself as an example, I am a PhD student working in Engineering at Purdue University, and will enter the work force very soon. I have worked and studied very hard to earn this opportunity to come to the USA and study here, and I have gathered extremely useful knowledge and skills. I really wish that with my skill set, I can work in the US easily with OPT until I can find a permanent job in the future. With a 24 month extra OPT, I can have more chances to get the lottery for H1B, and then having a very high chance to get it. If I have this new OPT policy to back me, I can focus more on the work and create more value for the company, the customers in the US (and globally) and make contribution to the US. In the long run, I may want to be a permanent resident of US, and I believe that the extension of the OPT is a first step towards that. It is going to make tremendous effect on my personal life, and I believe I will make great contribution to this country as paying back!
