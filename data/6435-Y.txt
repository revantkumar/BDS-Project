Lucas Liu As a F-1 student studying in Computer Science Master program, I've never felt a more urgent need to extend STEM OPT period. A lot of my international fellows also share the same concerns. We are severely constrained from launching startups after graduation given current OPT time limit. It is crucial for F1 STEM students with advanced degrees to have an extended time window to stay self-employed and start new companies which would also create more job opportunities for US citizens. Therefore, I strongly support this new proposal.
