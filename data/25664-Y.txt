It doesn't make any sense to make the STEM graduates leave right after graduation. We provide a valuable education and make them bright students and let them leave to create business opportunities on other countries right from the beginning? Instead we should keep the talent within the county for a few years at least and give them a chance to create more opportunities within the nation. Thus I strongly support the 24 month extension.
