Mohamed Shoaib Khan Abdul Azeez Khan To whom it may concern:

Immigrants all over the world make US richly diverse in all aspects, especially F-1 students who gain education here and contribute. This proposed rule will help the international students to get trained in the field they pursue masters. This rule should encourage students to pursue Ph.D. and indulge in research activity. To pursue Doctorate, one may have to take GRE exam to improve score and work towards a concrete research idea, this process takes more than 24 months.
Those who have a wrong impression of International students taking Americans' jobs, should understand that there are only 85,000 H1B petitions approved every year and most of which goes to the IT outsourcing companies and staffing companies, who submit more than one parallel H1B petitions for one candidate. Most of the legitimate and genuine international students' don't get their petitions approved, this has to be controlled. 

Apart from the hard work to contribute towards the growth of the country, F-1 students invest so much money on education. However, the F-1 students do not enjoy any immigration benefits. They struggle to get H1B then Green card.
I urge the government to implement this rule to retain brains that will help to develop the country and pave an easy way to acquire Green Card once the OPT period is completed bypassing H1B. Otherwise other countries like Canada (already Canada has commenced Express Entry Immigration system), Australia, New Zealand and etc. will use this opportunity to attract intelligent and hardworking people around the world and progress in their research activities.

Therefore, US administration has to fix the broken immigration system in regards to the F-1 students and progress more in research.
