I strongly support this new OPT rule. 

1. It is against the interest of academic sectors not to extend OPT for STEM students. 
When I was applying to pursue an advanced degree (Ph.D. in Biostatistics) in the U.S., the opportunity of getting work experience after graduation is an important factor that I considered. As in order to fully understand and learn the knowledge in my field, getting practical training is very necessary. Compared to other foreign countries, U.S. has provided international students with more opportunities for working in its country (with 12+17 months OPT and H1-B) and only with certain years of work experience can I improve my competitiveness when I come back to my own country. One of the reasons that U.S. universities and institutions could be top in the world is because its diversity. They could admit the most intelligent students in the world not only because of their education , but also because of the beneficial OPT policies in the past several years. With a very short OPT and very competitive H1-B lottery, U.S. academic sectors will lose a lot of talented students in the world. 

2. I don't think extending OPT will make employers lower their payment as I personally will not find a job that offers me salaries that are below average and I think most of my friends and classmates will not do it either. It's just simply because offering low salaries will not be attractive as we have better choices. As far as I know, no one has found a job that has salaries below average simply because they wanted to work here. Some even decided to come back to my own country right after graduation because they have sought better opportunities.
