I oppose the proposed rule change for the following reasons: 
The proposed rule will destroy the job prospects of recent American STEM graduates.
The proposed rule is an assault on American middle class workers.
Expanding OPT eligibility to three years after graduation will increase the labor pool for American tech jobs by hundreds of thousands. That alone will adversely affect job opportunities and wages.
OPT provides significant financial incentives for companies to bypass American workers.
Because OPT workers are technically "students," employers will not be required to pay payroll taxes for these employees. That would save companies about $10,000 a year for each of the three years they employ OPTs.
OPT workers will not have the same rights as other workers to unionize, or to move to different employers.
OPT expansion is a blatant attempt to make an end-run around limits on H-1B visas.
OPT expansion is overtly unfair to the foreign students in that they are not given raises and are forced work for lower wages than other STEM graduates. I have known many of these people and the first thing they do when they are green card eligible is to quit and apply for another job at double their current wage. 
I have also noted that many of these graduates have absolutely no hands on skills. They do not understand the basics of mechanics and how things work in the real world. That is a very dangerous situation for the consumers of products they design and build. 
Also, many of these students come from underdeveloped areas of the world. It is unfair to their countries to remove them from service in those countries where their skills are needed to improve the quality of life there. It is essentially a brain drain that keeps the said countries mired in poverty much longer than if they had the graduates that they most likely funded to attend college in the US. They are needed in their home countries.
