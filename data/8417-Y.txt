Joe Smith I STRONGLY SUPPORT the OPT extension for the following reasons:
1. The OPT extension is beneficial to the educational sectors, such as research institutes and universities. The OPT extension attracts more students to come to study in the US as the students have more chance to practice what they have learned. The students have to pay the tuitions and fees for their studies. It is a huge amount of funds, which can be used to construct the Infrastructure or provides scholarships for the local students. It reduces the financial pressure for the school. Also, more and more excellent students add global competitiveness to the schools and research institutes. On the other hand, if OPT extension is not allowed. Fewer students would choose US to continue their education. Many students would have to leave US even before they finish their research and scientific development. What a big loss!

2. For the current students who are under OPT extension, they have to leave US immediately. As we all know, since the high tech develops so fast that they have to employ more people to do such work. However, there are not enough local employees available, many big companies/research programs have to employ tons of people under OPT extension to maintain their operation. Once the OPT extension is revoked, what will happen to those companies, such as Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, etc? The companies can't remain their regular operations, stocks would drop, not enough products would be produced....As a country based on high tech and fast development, what would happen to the US then?

Therefore, OPT extension has to be continued.
