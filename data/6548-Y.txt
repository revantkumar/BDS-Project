Yao Shen The extension of Cap-Gap relief will create more job opportunities and stimulate local economies. The extension means that more people will stay in states and their need for purchases is unavoidable. Taking my school for instance, a huge portion of income for restaurants and shops around school come from international students for their necessity needs. The cost for government to monitor this group of students who are used to America society is so low. Please don't eliminate the chance of helping local community while the cost giving opportunity to F-1 students is so insignificant.
