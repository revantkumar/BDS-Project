I strongly support the proposal. Here are several reasons:

1. I think expanding OPT time will attract and keep more talent researchers and students to the US, which is a double win for both the States and the non-immigrant students. The country may benefit from the intellectual contribution from those students, while the latter could enjoy more opportunities to better develop themselves.

2. I don't think this proposal will reduce the job opportunities for residents of the States, as a lot of people concerned. STEM is fundamental to technology advances. By expanding OPT for STEM foreign students, the nation could increase the opportunity of developing new technology and of improving international cooperation. These will actually create more job opportunities and maintain the prosperity of this country.

3. Although in short-term, expanding OPT may cause more competition, this may not be a bad thing in the long run. Competition is one of the main drives for development and improvement. It leads to advancements. And these advancements are definitely beneficial for people in the States as well as people all over the world.
