I am an international students at Northwestern University. I strongly believe that to extend OPT of STEM graduates to 24 months will benefit US companies for the following reasons.

Firstly, providing longer OPT extension will benefit US companies in the latest techniques and strategies in field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This helps companies to increase involvement in communities as a result. Also, it is an important path for companies to attract future students. 

Secondly, the extension of OPT will allow US firms to take advantage of the experience of well-trained students. Working for a companies for 3 years instead of 1 will allow students to participate in bigger project, achieving more innovation and developing new products and technology, which will further fuel the US economy.
