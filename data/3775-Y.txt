Importing talents all around the world is a key part of American spirit. It is also the way to keep this country prosperous and charming. Moreover, only 120k foreigners are able to get OPT and even fewer are qualified for a STEM extension every year. I don't really think they will affect the employeement rate at all. On the other side, giving opportunities to smart people who can make good contributions to the US is of course beneficial. Stopping making extensions won't just scare away these good scientists and innovators. It will also lead to a huge negative impact on those large companies. If they are no longer able to find great talents inside US, they will expand their oversea sites and reduce the headcount inside US. It is even worse for Americans who are still looking for jobs on the long run.
