I fully support the rule in its proposed format. I feel OPT is the time during which the student (whose US training has inevitably been funded to an extent by the American taxpayer) starts giving back actively to the American economy. I feel the proposed rule goes to a large extent in addressing the drawbacks of the current rule and also rightly puts in the checks to prevent abuse of the rule.
