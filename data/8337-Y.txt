I strongly support it. STEM students they are intelligent. Our government spends so much money and effort to educate them, so why cannot let them stay at our country and pay contributions to our nation? We take so much effort to make the illegal immigrations legal. STEM students do nothing wrong and make much more contributions than them. There are many startups need STEM students in home and abroad. They will make more jobs to our high technology market. America is a great country because of its diversity and comprehension. Don't ruin it.
