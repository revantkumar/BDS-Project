I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.., there're so many excellent men from all over the world.
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition makes U.S. better.
