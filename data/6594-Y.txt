I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.

2. It is really a WIN-WIN proposal that american firm can get better talents with ability make great contributions to the U.S. society. 

3. Competition is never a bad thing!
