Ronnie Williams Why are we giving away jobs to foreign workers instead making it easier to train Americans for those jobs? I'm just frustrated with the way our government is only got big business in mind instead of serving the publics best interest. I'm a 60% disabled veteran and I feel as if the government is happier to give more help and aid to foreigners then me, I do receive VA benefits but its not even enough to help pay rent or groceries and I can't even get help with my dental needs.
