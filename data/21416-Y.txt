As a graduate student, it will be a good news to both of my future employer and me if I can have more time to make contribution. 24 months is a very insightful decision because, as an electrical engineer, most of our project take two years to finish. If OPT is less than 24 months, there is a big chance that the R&D group will lose important engineers when the project is half way done. So, a big support on this proposal!
