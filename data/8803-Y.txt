Anonymous Anonymous This renewed rule is very helpful to this program. 
1. International students just graduated from the STEM program would usually work more diligently, as they are eager to gain some practical experience quickly. 
2. On the other hand, for the area of civil engineering which deals with the infrastructre of the state, it is actually in high demand of young engineers as there is a rapidly growing requirement on the update of the outdated infrastructures across America. From my observation, local students alone cannot meet this demand, which makes it imperative to try to attract international students to this industry. Otherwise if US lose these talents and they get back to their home country to help the local coporations. It is very likely that in the future when American companies try to bid for overseas projects, those students would become their competitors representing companies from their home countries.
3. Last but not the least, as STEM students we've been told that there is this benefit to facilitate our post-graduation employment. Federal government should not just suddenly vacate it with one single overrule from a local court to affect tens of thousands of F1 students. This would significantly discredit the integrity of the goverment and its international image, and then possibly lose a quite amount of applicants to its higher education programs as a result.
