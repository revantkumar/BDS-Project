With all of the emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), where will the employment opportunities for homegrown talent originate? By extending the time period for F-1 students, the net effect is highly likely to reduce those opportunities for native-born STEM graduates in an epoch when government RDT&E spending has been on a declining trajectory since the "peace dividend" of the early 1990s.

Australia has already noted that their STEM graduates face similar pressures -- few STEM job opportunities for their STEM graduates as a result of decreased CSIRO funding.

RDT&E is important to future American success. It is also important to ensure that native-born American STEM graduates have a higher chance of participating and fulfilling those roles; increased opportunity for F-1 visa holders should only be granted if and only if there native Americans STEM graduates are fully employed.
