I totally support this proposal for the following reasons:
Students from STEM are well-trained and educated for those rapidly developing fields, who are needed globally. Improving and expanding training opportunities for them will definitely facilitate the growth of science and technology as well as high-tech industries in the United States of America, which will finally improve its national strength and give the United States advantages in the global competition.Furthermore,the flourish of high-tech industries can create more job opportunities thus providing a solution for the civil unemployment problem.
