I strongly SUPPORT the opt extension proposal for the following reasons:
First, as the greatest country in the world, what makes the greatness of US? It's built by talent people from all over the world. We have Albert Einstein, one of the the greatest scientist, who came form Germany. And Ieoh Ming Pei, one of the greatest Chinese American architect... All the great moments in American's history wouldn't have happened if they hadn't had the chance to stay in US. That's not only a chance for individuals to be great, but also a chance for US to be greater.
Second, without OPT extension, I could see decrease of international students applying for US universities. And we all know that international students pay higher tuitions than local students. That's a loss of funding source for universities. 
Third, the right way to get things right is to supply EQUAL competition opportunities, NOT just SHUT THE DOOR. International students are not taking chances from local people, they are pushing the level up and let those unqualified people fail themselves. THIS IS THE RULE OF NUTURE.
I think extending the OPT would only brings benefits to this country,so I STRONGLY SUPPORT this decision.
