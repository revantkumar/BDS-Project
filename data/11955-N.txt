This program will not help the 92 million American Citizens looking for jobs NOW ! Only foreign born non US Citizens will benefit from this program .I urge most strongly that this OPT program either be suspended or canceled outright until the 92 MILLION US Citizens that need jobs are fully employed ! No More IMPORTING foreign workers to take jobs IN these UNITED STATES FROM THE CITIZENS TO WHOM THOSE JOBS RIGHTFULLY BELONG. Look at the example of the Disney Co. that was spotlighted in the news in October 2015 - it forced its domestic staff to train its OWN foreign born H1B replacements if they didn't comply to the satisfaction of The Disney Co.they were denied a severance package.
To allow this kind of treatment to the Citizens/Voters/Workers of this Country is to invite a well deserved basklash against the government that is attempting this,this Country is getting very angry at the very same government that threatens to outsource the very sustenance of this country ITS PEOPLE ! For to attempt to try to outsource the very people - the CITIZENS of this country that is at its core treason and when done by the government workers whos salarys are paid by those Citizen whom the government is trying to replace is absolute despotism and it will be stopped - either peacefully or through force - its the choice of the people in the bureaucracy ! 
STAND DOWN from this UNCONSTITUTIONAL and ILLEGAL POLICY ! or it will have to be stopped forcibly ! THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT EMPOWERED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM TO IMPORT FOREIGN REPLACEMENTS FOR UNITED STATES CITIZENS
