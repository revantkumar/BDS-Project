I am a US citizen. I have struggled to find work in my career as a carpenter due to the influx of illegal laborers. Now that I am considering finishing my degree I have to worry that I'll be competing with foreign workers. Stop pitting us against foreign workers in our own country, and stop circumventing the laws made by congress. I am against giving our jobs to foreigners.
