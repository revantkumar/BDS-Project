I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for U.S.. There are many Americans who has make great contributions to this country are also international students. They get great help from the government, so that they are willing to make contributions to this country.This is why U.S. is the greatest and strongest country in the world.

3. Competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing. All the international students compete for their job in this country. More competitions will make this country more powerful, because they talent students will make more contributions.

4. In fact, I don't see too many native students study in STEM. If there is no support for the international students make contributions on these fields, this country may be caught up by China and India, so we should support the best international students who will indeed make great contributions to this country.
