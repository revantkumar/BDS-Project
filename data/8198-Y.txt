I strongly support this proposal. I came to US for higher education since I always believe this country provides fair environments and equal opportunities to people who has the persevering and persistent spirit regardless of color, gender, and nationality.
International students absolutely have no priorities in education and job hunting, thus we do not pose any threat to local residents. Oppositely, The repeal of STEM OPT extension rule could result in unemployment problems. US universities and colleges will take a huge loss due to missing of large international student resource, most companies of science and technology will lose competitiveness for lack of multicultural senior talents. Competition produces creativeness and innovation, which will bring more job opportunities in the long term development. If the government and citizens exclude international talents for fear of competition, the US leading status in STEM area would be seriously affected!
