I strongly support the proposal. Most international students come to United States for higher education, use US resources, knowledge, and after so many years of training and education, you just let them go back without even letting them contribute in US? Most international students on OPT are not paid with lower wages, and on the contrary, are paid above the prevailing wage. They are not replacing the job from US citizens because most of the job could not find qualified US citizens. In this competitive world, especially high tech industry, its very naive from some US citizens to blame F1- nonimmigrant students for not being able to find a decent job. Get a good education and prepare yourself for competition that you will face.
