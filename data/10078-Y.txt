As a Chinese work in the U.S., I strongly believe we bring more benefits to this country. Take myself as an example: I work in an e-commerce company in NY, my boss is Chinese and he doesn't speak English well but he wants to invest money and run business in the U.S. The best solution is to hire several international students to help him translate and operate the company. As we all know, Chinese bosses are getting richer and richer, they want to find better opportunities in the U.S. The biggest issue is the language barrier and cultural barrier. They are creating employment opportunities for American but if the U.S. doesn't give international student longer extension term, we would not have enough time to help business grow which means we can't help company create more job opportunities for American people. 

From my point of view, this policy would at least: 1. Benefit the international investors by providing reliable and stable international students who can communicate with boss and co worker very well. If they are satisfied, they will keep investing which is very helpful to US economy. 2. Benefit American, as the companies grow, more job opportunities are created. Which will increase employment rate. 3. Make the US more diverse, bring new ideas, new things. 

In short, considering this policy from an international side instead of a national side, it brings much more benefits to this country.
