Our United States government AND Administrative employees, Directors, DHS, and anyone concerned with filling STEM jobs should be first and foremost considering US Citizens and Citizens who graduate from our colleges and Universities for any position. There is no reason to put foreign students and visa holders ahead of our own people. We are tired of companies going around the system and adding extra visas without regard to our own unemployed legal residents and citizens. Stop destroying our country. USA all the way!!!
