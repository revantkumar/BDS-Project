Xiao Han I strongly support the 24 month STEM OPT rule.

I don't think OPT students are taking away job opportunities that belongs to U.S. residents. If you want to work in U.S. in long term, you will need to apply a H1B Visa, which is strictly limited to 85,000 per year. And according to 2015 data, only 10% H1B applicants are STEM OPT students. So does STEM OPT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident? NO!
