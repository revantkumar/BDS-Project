I strongly SUPPORT this proposal that extends OPT up to 24 months.
The reason is simple, this policy can attract more international students come to US college or university. So the country could have more talents people to ensure the first position of America in the world. What's more, we all know, the 21st century's greatest resource is talent. Don't push talents outside of the country, if so, the US not only lose a lot of talents but could have more competitors.
