I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Back from history US is an immigrant country, it welcomes people who work hard and have a dream, those students who come here are totally in legal, and we should provide an opportunity to let the people who can make a contribution to this country to stay here.

2 Encourage the high tech students staying here would benefit US in the long run. Most STEM students are studying in Math, Computer Science and Engineering, and lots of them are very talented, to keep US being competitive in this one world, we need to retain the talent instead of sending them home and compete against us
