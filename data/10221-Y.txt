xianghong Li I strongly support the expansion of OPT for F-1 non immigrant students. As a nation being friendly to talented people, America has always been a desination for international students in that America's higeher education attaches importance to both theoretical and practical application and OPT is an integral part of education espcially for SYEM students.This is why American higher education attracts more and more international students, which renders America highly competitive in absorbing students and does good to boosting American economy. Many parents of these students come to America to pay visits to their children who are studying in American universities, which help boost the tourism there in America and make great contributions to American Economy. Therefore, I strongly support the expansion of OPT for F-1 non immigrant students.For instance, I gave $50,000 to my son each year for 6 years and my husband and I spent $20,000 visiting many tourist attractions in America while we go to see our son. I believe we are making contribtions to American economy.
