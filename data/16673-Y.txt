I strongly support that OPT should be further extended to another 24 months after its first 12 months period ends. I am grateful for the opportunity to receive higher education in United States while being fully financially supported and I would like to contribute what I learned back to this country. 

In the job market, it is never a fair competition between foreigners and American citizens, with or without the extension, people have been shut down from a job offer solely because of failure to win the H1B lottery or lack of U.S. citizenship, the last thing we want is to create an even higher barrier for those well-educated foreign people who are willing to work in United States. Moreover, American STEM people, with all respect, if with all you have, you still cannot get a STEM job, maybe it's time to think about yourself, instead of blaming on other people who happens to be more qualified than you in the campanies' opinions, even though you speak perfect English. It may never be about the extension, is that possible that you're simply aiming at a wrong direction?
