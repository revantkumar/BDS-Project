Shiyi Zhang I think it is a good proposal since it a friendly message to not only OPT students, but also international students in college and those expect to go to American for further education. 

The bad news in Aug. 12 that OPT extension was revoked by the court caused panic among international students. We began to wonder whether it was worth studying there and didnt understand why American suddenly acted so unfriendly to us. We always think the US is a powerful, diversified and friendly country. This is why we make our minds to go there rather than European or Austria.

Therefore, we are grateful for the new proposal and hope it will begin to work soon. We still love this country and want to explore its adventure. We need this proposal to cut away the panic and well continue telling friends that US is and will always be the first choice if one wants to study abroad.
