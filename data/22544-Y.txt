I strongly support this proposed rule for the following reasons:

First, OPT program could attract more outstanding foreign students to study in the US. Most of them pay their tuitions and living expense by themselves especially for the BS or MS degrees. So extending the OPT could bring students with higher qualities and the money foreign students contribute could also release the financial problems that colleges and universities are facing and help with the US economy. If the international students learn that even if they get education in US, they will have no chance to work here due to the policy. I doubt whether there will still be that many foreign students coming here.

Second, hiring international students doesnt mean stealing jobs from Americans. Most of the companies prefer to hire US citizens, so its more difficult for international students to get a job than Americans do. Also, personally, the international students I know who could get jobs here are outstanding students and they are also paid with good salaries. Especially for those international students working in IT company, they are paying with salaries much higher than the American average salary. So the international students are getting jobs because they have solid skills and are qualified for the jobs. its definitely not true that companies are paying much less to hire international students so that Americans are losing lots of working opportunities. 

Whats more, the IT sections in US need large quantities of talents. And there is no doubt that international students with a STEM degree are indispensable forces contributing to the boom of this industry. And the boom of the IT sector also brings lots more opportunities for US citizens. I couldnt imagine how much those IT companies will lose if foreign students with great hard skills cannot work in US. 
Overall, i think this rule will not only be a benefit for foreign students but also for the US society.
