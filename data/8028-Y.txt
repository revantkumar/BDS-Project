I abusolutely SUPPORT the proposal and we NEED the talent to work for our country!!! 

Firstly, the international students are making huge contributions to our country. They must be the most intelligent people to pursue higher education in U.S. from other countries. Why should we reject such a huge opportunity to hire them to make contribution to us?

Secondly, the international student come for education, I think they should have the right to have optional practical training for a temporary time (eg. 1-3 years) after graduate. Otherwise, its' meaningless for them to pursue higher education form another country where the language and culture are totally different from their original country. 

They should have the OPT to get training to becoming our employees to make great contribution to our industry world. Though some of us feel bad to let them being citizens, and they said"If so, being a citizen worth nothing at all", but that's the "Survival of the fittest"!!!! 

We are not going to have a strong and developing country without top intelligent talent!!!! I support the OPT 24 months extension!!!!
