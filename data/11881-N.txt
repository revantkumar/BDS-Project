I am still confused as to why our own government, or as I see it now ,our controllers, continue to push for foreign worker training (OPT) rather than using the same training from our citizens. It reminds me of the cell phone services, once they get you to sign up there's no loyalty. I can only think in this case it'as all about the money. Our employers can save cost on pay based on foreign worker complement. 
I believe there is a current law to eliminate the hiring of foreign worker if citizen workers are available. I also understand that if an employer is caught cheating on this law he his permanently barred from further participation in this practice, So I guess the problem again is the government no doing it's job, of course it will be blamed on the lack of funds to properly execute this action of oversight. I suggest we first look at the agency assigned to oversee this.issue and see what kind of production we get from the people working at this agency. I suspect you will find we only get about one to two hours for an eight hour day. There in lie the problem with our government and that due to federal unions, workers are protected way beyond their usefulness.
We pretty much know that in the private sector this would not be tolerated and firings, layoffs and what other methods necessary for increase in production would be effected.
