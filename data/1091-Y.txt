I strongly support the extension of OPT training period for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM. As far as I know, STEM students mostly completed their training in the field of computer and information science, an area with great need and the U.S working force cannot fulfill. One year is too short for any practical industry training in general, and the students cannot quite leverage what they have learnt in school to the real world. The STEM students are contributing to the U.S economy and industry, if the OPT extension is cancelled, the U.S tech companies will have great loss and cannot make up for it. IT WILL NOT AFFECT THE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE AT ALL! Because companies are more willing to hire a U.S citizen because the procedures for a F-1 holder is much more complicated. The companies may file H1B or green card for them in the future so if they could hire a citizen, they would rather not hire a F-1 student. Again, OPT extension is so important that everybody should support, it is good for the future of the United States.
