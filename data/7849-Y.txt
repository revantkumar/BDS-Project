Xiaotian Li My husband and a lot of his foreign schoolmates are working in high tech companies with STEM degree to work. So directly abolishing the STEM policies will bring a negative impact our IT industry, which may force a lot engineer with excellent skills running away from US and come to other foreign company which are competitors of those high tech company in US. It will be a disaster of Internet and high tech industry in US.

Someone may say that foreigners with OPT STEM visa may compete with our citizens in the short run and with a lower payment. The reason that the larger high tech company hire those foreigners are they are well trained from the University in US and the qualified US citizens in high tech job market are so limited. As I know from my husband's company and his friends', the salary for those foreign employers are just at the same level with US citizens. Hence, I do not agree with the point that those employees bring a impact to US citizens on their salary.

Moreover, OPT STEM visa is considered to be non-immigration visa. Even it is extended to 3 years, a large part of those foreigners will finally back to their home countries instead of staying in US as my husband and his collages said. When OPT STEM extension collaborate with small H1B quota, and long green card waiting time, the policies help US citizens to stop immigration waives while keep foreigners serving for us for a long time.

In conclusion, STEM policies help high our tech industry grow, and also collaborate with H1B and green card policies to stop immigration waives while keep the foreigners working for us.

Considering the benefits for US citizens I stated above. I strongly agree to preserve STEM extension policies and even increase the extension period.

Thanks,
