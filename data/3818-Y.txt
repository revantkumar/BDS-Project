I strongly support this policy due to the following reasons:

1. Most of the people who disagree with this extension argue that international students steal jobs from American people. It is exactly the opposite. If the employers can hire a US citizen, who bother to hire an international student? It is those international students who bridge the gap between jobs and workers. These STEM students contribute a lot to the technology boom in the last decade and help to create more jobs here in U.S.. If we have to deport these international students who play critical roles, those employers will suffer and job market may actually deteriorate.

2. To make it worse, those international students with skills learned here in US will come back to their own countries and develop new technology that competes with American. Who knows one day China or India will have the next Steve Jobs who creates the next Apple? It is possible. Therefore, this extension may help to retain those talents in US and help this country remain the top innovator in the world. 

3. U.S. has the best education system in the world, but the lead has been challenged by other countries, such as Canada and UK. Why? Because U.S. cannot provide the best environment for international students. OPT is an important part of education and one-year OPT is obviously not enough. We have all worked on projects before and we all know that one year is only enough for a student to learn the basics without actual contributions. Therefore, 24-month extension will make up the missing part in advanced education and make US again the most popular education destination in the world.
