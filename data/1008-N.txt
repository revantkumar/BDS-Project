The reality about F-1 visa is, like most immigration work visas, is that they get abused and the people who are supposed to investigate the applicants are not doing their jobs. The big tech giants like Gates and Zuckerberg lay off U.S. citizens and then bring in these, supposedly qualified workers, under the F-1 visas. They are then able to exploit the cheaper labor because these immigrants cant quit or complain or they will be deported. Sound like a pretty good reason to end these types of programs. Lets' face it, the people lobbying for these immigrant worker visas are not the same people who are at risk of losing their jobs to them. It is the average American worker who is fighting to feed his family that gets hurt by this. Meanwhile, the wealthy get cheaper labor.
