I don't think the OPT time should be extended. It is a fact that most of these "non-immigrant" students will leverage the time to get H1B, and eventually green cards, and unless the H1B cap is increased as well, this will just increase the competition for a work visa for STEM students down the road. Extending OPT time is like trying to patch up a bullet wound with a band-aid. If the purpose is to have more people immigrated to the US, this is not the way to do it. If the purpose is to give them more training just so they can go home, then..why?
