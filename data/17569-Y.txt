I strongly support the extension of STEM student OPT training period for all eligible F1 students.
These students are high degree holders with well equipped knowledge of science and technology, which fill ups the human resource shortage of high tech worker of Unite States. The markets and industries have huge demand for these type of workers and are always short of these type of workers. Therefore STEM students are NOT threats to American workers. All H1B holders have to went through strictly advertising process to ensure no qualified American worker can be found. The STEM population are trivial comparing to illegal immigration population, we shall encourage qualified immigrant to stay in United States, instead of send them home after they gain education in United States.
