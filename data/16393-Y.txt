I'm against illegal immigrants, but I think US should definitely give more chances to STEM students to work in this country.

Take me for an example. I have three years of experience working in one of the best immunology labs in China and have authored several articles on some of the most influential international journals. 

I was offered chances to work for the Chinese government with good money and housing (taking care of the rents for their scientists is a communism tradition) but I value the freedom of speech and basically whatever freedom US has but China doesn't, and that's why I'm about to graduate with a MS degree in the STEM field here in US this December. However, the current OPT and H1B paperwork is really discouraging. If I can only work 1 year, I'd just go back and save my time since 1 year in science research is simply far from enough to achieve anything.

My internship boss is a patriotic Republican and he's totally willing to have me work for him and help me immigrate. STEM students, especially "nerdy Asian STEM grads" like me with a full score on GRE quantities is a valuable resource and we can be extremely useful in the modern technology world.

Plus, for those Chinese STEMs that prefer the free world like me, it's really important to keep US more competitive than CCP. We're the kind of people that got recruited by CCP and make those aircraft carrier killer missiles, regardless of our free will. Moreover, CCP can easily give a scientist a hard time if he/she refuses its offer. It's just not a good thing to turn down CCP when you're a Chinese citizen, and I DO NOT want to work for them.

Please make it easy for us to work for you. If you're worried about the espionage and spies, tune up your censorship. Don't keep us out, keep us in.
