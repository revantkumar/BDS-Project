I support this proposal:
American needs talents to maintain our competence, especially in technology company. It is not to say we will hire every foreign STEM student. Instead, we could take the most advantage of our high quality education. They are really trained well and some of them are really creative. Americans economy needs these students to compete with other foreign companies in Japan, Europe, China and so on. So please make this proposal pass earlier.
