The OPT Extension will benefit America in the following ways:

1. Keep talented international students in US companies, instead of letting them join companies in other countries

2. It will not create competition with American workers, since most of these students will have to return to their home countries after the 3-year OPT. Only those who are truly talented will be given H1-B or Permanent Residency, since very few employers are willing to petition the H1-B Visa or Green Card unless the employees have truly contributed a lot to the companies, in which case they can be considered talented and should be kept in the US so they can future contribute to the US economy and technologies.

3. International students are LEGAL visitors. They did not enter the US without permission and therefore would not be considered as illegal immigrants if they continued to stay in the US after the completion of their program under OPT.

4. As an American engineering student, I have many classmates who are from other countries. Some of them are truly brilliant. In fact, the top student in my department (Dept. of EECS, UC Berkeley) is international. America should absorb the best talent from the world instead of arrogantly believing that only US students are creative and brilliant.
