I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.. Diversity is also very important to the U.S..

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.Competition can help U.S. select more talented and qualified employees, and increase the average ability and furthermore allows U.S. to compete better globally. 

3. Some of the international students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the United States. Prompt action appropriate with respect to those students who have already committed to study in the United States, partly based on the possibility of furthering their education through an extended period of practical training in the world's leading STEM economy.
