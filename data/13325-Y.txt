I strongly agree to this extension of OPT. Foreign students study hard and they have very professional skills in their own fields. If the OPT extension fails, the Unites States will lose thousands of high-tech talents. These high-tech talents will go back to their own countries and make contributions to their own countries. 
For decades, USA is the only superpower in the world. The reason obviously is the open immigration police. If the U.S. government shuts the door for high-tech foreign talents, other countries will speed up to chase and win in the future.
