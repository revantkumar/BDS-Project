I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

Firstly, The government has many restricitions to the foreign students, but indulge the illegal immigrants, which is very incredible and makes no sense. United States is a country that advocates freedom and tolerance, international students create a lot of wealth for the country, however, illegal immigrants increase a lot of instability to the society. The people who are opposed to the OPT Extension policy should focus more on strengthening the management of illegal immigrants.

Secondly, the government is very concerned about the employment of their own people, many of the institutions provide guidance and training to all the citizens. So they still cannot find a job, not because of the international students, but they are not willing to do or do not have the ability to do. More and more inventions are not created and developed by the Americans, they are content with things as they are instead of working hard. The people who have great ability will find a job anywhere, so creating more opportunities for international students will encourage the Americans to improve themselves. Where there is competition, there is progress.

Thirdly, City Sports in Boston had already gone bankrupt, Super fresh in East Coast would close down soon, and Citi Bank also closed all the branches in Massachusetts. That means economic slump has not bottomed out and that it may grow worse. In 2008, the subprime crisis destroyed the financial industry and the automotive industry, if the government decides to cancel the OPT Extension policy, it will be a CRUSHING BLOW to the technology industry, many companies (especially start-up) will lose a lot of labor and close down, innovation will stagnate. The government must carefully consider about this policy, must consider the OVERALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. Otherwise, more and more people will lose their jobs, what's worse, United States will LOSE HEGEMONY STATUS in the world.
