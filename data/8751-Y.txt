I highly support STEM OPT extension for the following reasons: 
1. To American economic continue to grow, large amount of STEM employees are needed, while those internationals are well trained candidates.
2. To make U.S more competitive worldwidely, sending those well trained students to their own countries will only decrease the impact of U.S. 
3. U.S has been a immigration country since beginning, internationals shall have the fair opportunity to make contribution to the country.
