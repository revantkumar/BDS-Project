As an international student, I strongly support the proposal.

1.The American dream is the immigration dream. The skilled immigration is very important for the improvement of United States. Looking around the silicon valley, you could see many hardworking and innovative engineers who make enormous contribution.

2.The skilled immigration will increase the competition into the job market and will become the important human resources for the rapid development of United States. The core of competition between countries is the competition between talents. High skilled talents not only fill the serious gaps in some fields but also increase economic vitality, growth and potential of United States which generate more job opportunities.

3.The proposal reflects the American Values like equal opportunity, achievement and success, practicality and efficiency and so on. To be honest, if United States increases the restriction of the new immigration, the high-skilled talents will choose other immigration countries like Canada and Australia. 

Finally, I would like to say that it is a big deal to support the proposal.
