I'm a F-1 student currently working in Silicon Valley. I think this improving and expanding is really great not just for me but also for my employer. As a F-1 student, without STEM extension we have only one change with the H1B lottery and regarding the chance, it is really frustrating. But with 24 mo extension, not only can we improve and learn from the training experience, and also we contribute to our employers, in my case, even to the Silicon Valley.
