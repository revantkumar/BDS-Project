I am one of the supporter for OPT extension.

United States is one of the most powerful country because she takes the best of all that GOD has given to the world. 

Every year foreign students and scholars come to US for education and conference. Our great nation should always keep open to those talents, especially for those technical engineers workers. Diversity keeps our society dynamic and creative.

Most of American have a immigrant ancestor, including those guys who left terrible comments. Thats who we are, an immigration country.
