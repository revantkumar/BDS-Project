I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is the core of American spirit. While the H1B cap amount is not likely to increase in the near future, it is good to give those who lose the lotteries equal opportunity to work in the United States.

2. STEM subject requires accumulation of experience and inspiration. That said, attracting more STEM students to stay in the US and make contributions will benefit the country in the long run.

3. There is an increasing trend over the world that more and more countries are promoting policies to recruiting more talents. The United States should not do the opposite thing.
