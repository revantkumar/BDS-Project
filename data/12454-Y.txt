The rule has not proposed anything about the current students who are already under 17 months STEM extension and haven't completed it yet. Also, as mentioned in page 63382 F-1 students has a huge impact on US economy so it is important to make laws that favor STEM students which in turn benefit the country. As mentioned on page 63383 attracting more international students may increase US chances of competing in the global race for research talent. I strongly agree with Canadian government policies here, a substantial growth in economy and competence with leading technology producers tells about it.
