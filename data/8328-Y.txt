Guang Yang I strongly support this act based on two reasons. (1) technology is always the driving factor for US economy growth. In the recent years, US economy is healthy because of the great contribution these stems students made. Sending them back basically means that US is giving up its advantage; (2) there are a lot of national research funds went to support stem students' research and studies, let us stem students go without asking them to "pay back" through working for US based entities is not a reasonable action.
