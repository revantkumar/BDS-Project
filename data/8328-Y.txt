The stem extension is essential for both employers and students. Let's take an example of my own scenario. I graduated with PhD in Computer Science from the top research university working in the cancer treatment. Now, I am in my 12 month optional practical training working for a manufacturer that builds the software and hardware for the cancer treatment. It takes more than six months for me to understand the system. If there is no Stem extension, the employer loose all the investments and doesn't get any output.

The stem extension is needed to attract talents and grow the US economy. The US government has provided the scholarship to cover my educational expenses. I have developed a strong research and problem solving skills by working with the top scientist in the field. My skills will be crucial for the company to solve the innovative problems which will create new jobs and grow the US economy. However, I will be forced to leave the US if I can't acquire the work permit. In many scenarios, the employer can't secure a work permit because of the wait and processing time of the immigration matter. The stem extension provides the enough time so that the employer can secure a work visa and permanent residency for the qualified employee.

The stem extension provides an opportunity to qualified students to shine and immigrate to the US. It takes time for employer to know employee and realize the value of the employee for the company growth. It's almost impossible to demonstrate that value in 12 months, especially when you have to spend more than six months just to understand the system. The stem extension provides the enough time for students to show their potential without worrying too much about the future. I believe that it makes sense to give an opportunity to hard working students to build their career.
