I highly support DHS's rule that extends OPT to another 24 months. Students who get extension are highly educated and skilled person who can make great contributions to U.S. economy. especially for high-technology industry. Most of them graduated from prestigious U.S. universities and got job offers from well-known U.S. companies. For these companies, they are valuable assets that many companies are forced to transfer their foreign employees to their international offices to retain them. For students themselves, they spent a lot of money to study abroad and they worked very hard to get their degree and to get job offers. They feel very sad that they have to terminate their career when it just started after went through all these difficulties.
