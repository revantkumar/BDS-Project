I would fully support this expansion since it's a win-win situation for both employers and employees in the state. In terms of employers, this expansion gives them a longer time interval over which they don't need to worry about their international employees' sponsorship. In terms of employees, they will feel less stressful at the beginning of their career. International students and employees have always occupied a high proportion in high-tech market owing to the openness of the state. Rejection of the new policy would no doubt result in a huge lose of talents.
