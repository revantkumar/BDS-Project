I strongly agree with new rule. I am an international student from Japan, I received offer from universities in U.S., U.K., and Australia. The reason I choose U.S. as my final decision is the work opportunity I can get here. Now my 12-month OPT is nearly end and I am badly in need of the OPT extension to gain more work experience before go back to my home country. My work in my current company is just in the right track, and my manager hopes I can lead a project next year. If we can have a longer OPT period that would be great for both tech companies and international students!
