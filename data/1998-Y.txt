I believe the OPT extension for STEM should be increased to 36 months . Since the students land US universities for better education which is missing in their country , the students should be given the chance to learn and understand their course work as no learning is complete without practical training . 

The students are going US universities because of its rapport and quality and chance to understand the industry and work innovative through practical training . If these are not provided grads will get discouraged to join US universities and will go Europe and other countries which are embracing foreign students and providing them the opportunity to get the exposure with work related to their course for better understanding .

US will definitely loose its demand and charm by revoking this OPT!!!!
