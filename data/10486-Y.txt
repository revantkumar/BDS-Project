Why not? Foreign students have contributed a big amount of money to U.S. economy, which provided a lot of job opportunities to U.S. citizens. As far as I known, one international student will spend more than 50k dollars a year in the U.S. 
Nowadays, many countries such as UK, Australia and Canada are actively instituting new policy to attract international students. If the extension was rejected, the U.S. universities will lose competitiveness and those students will go to other countries and contribute to other countries. 
What's more, some students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the U.S.. People will feel the U.S. is dishonest, if this extension is denied, because DHS doesn't give the benefits to these international students which they had promised.
STEM OPT extension will benefit both students and U.S. citizens, there is no reason to oppose it.
