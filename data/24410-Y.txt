I SUPPORT the OPT extension proposal for the following reason:

OPT is a competitive edge for universities in United States to attract more talented students. Comparing with other schools in countries like England, China and Japan, OPT in United States is a welfare program to help international students to put their studies from school into practice and 12 months OPT is not enough for them to get a good practice. Some talented international students spend lots of money on tuition fee and living cost, they make some contribution to United States economy. United States universities let them to get interested in what they studied and find them useful. OPT extension is a good method to give them a chance to learn more and do more contribution to their related fields.

In conclusion, OPT extension proposal can help international students to gain more knowledge and put the knowledge into good practice more easily. In this way, more talented international students will choose United States in the further. 

Thank you very much for your attention.
