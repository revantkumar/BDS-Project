STEM OPT will benefit the United States in terms of economic, social and cultural integration. Economically, International students have contributed largely to schools' income from which the schools are sustained.Country's such as Saudi Arabia and many African countries send their students to the U.S because it is considered a leader in research, science and technology. This might be developed from the testimony of people who study in the U.S and have the opportunity to overcome the shortcoming of a traditional classroom teaching through the development of real life experience that OPT offers. However, since the most attractive fields of study for international students are in STEM area, the one year time frame is not enough to give graduates the much needed time to fully develop their skills. If this STEM OPT is implemented and expanded, student will get the chance to overcome time barrier and go back home fully prepared which will serve as an advertisement for prospective students discerning schooling abroad. This will increase enrollment in US schools, advance the economy through tuition and other expenses as well as improve social cultural integration for the United States
