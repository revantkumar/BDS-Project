Wen Su It is really shortsighted to stop the OPT extension. There are a big number of excellent international students who provide great support for both the development of academic area and industial area. For one thing, many courses have international students as TAs and tutors, who will help a lot of students. The native students will also benefit a lot. If the extension was stopped, there would be a great decrease of international students at school and it would definitely decrease the potential international students in the future, since some programs are too short and they will not spend a large sum of money to pursue a degree in US. In addition, schools and universities need financial support from applicants and international students. Native students will not pay as much as international students. If the extension was stopped, native students need to pay more themselves.

Moreover, industries also need international students who are excellent personnels. There are a lot of startups which will generate more working opportunities both now and in the future. It is really shortsighted to consider international students as competitions. Actually, the society only moves forward with the great support of talents. If the opt extension was stopped, it would cause a great loss to the US society. The US society would lose great intelligent support and financial incomes.
