Xin Li I agree with this proposal based on several observations and I think it is beneficial for tech companies, the stock market and more importantly, the average U.S people. 

The main reason for people criticizing this extension is that those STEM students seize their opportunities to work. It seems plausible, however, it is not true, as I will show the line of reasoning below.

First of all, the number of job positions in a company are not static, but closely related to how well the tech company runs. Honestly, as far as I am concerned, why the IT industry of the U.S can dominate the world is that it has an open mind for foreign students. General speaking, these students are much more competitive than their U.S classmates, in terms of technical skills. These foreign students are both hardworking and smart, hoping to a technical expert. Because of these hardworking and smart guys, those open tech companies are more competitive and thus providing more job positions for the U.S citizens. The best example is the IT industry. It is hard to deny that the IT industry is one of the most profitable and active industry in the U.S. We can see there are a lot of foreign students dedicating to their work in IT industry. The CEOs of some IT giants are foreign students: the CEO of Google is a Stanford Alumni from India. 

Second, these foreign students compel their U.S citizen counterparts to work harder and in turn strengthening the U.S. One counter example is from Detroit. Since the car industry in the U.S was no longer competitively to Japanese car industry anymore, its market share was nibbled by Japanese car industry. Final, the corruption of many car producers made many people lose their job opportunities. What a comparison between the car industry and IT industry.
