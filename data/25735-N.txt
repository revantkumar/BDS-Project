There is a growing number of USA citizens fed up with the federal government spitting upon them. An army of under- and unemployed Americans are watching foreigners being used to bypass the economic law of supply/demand and thus keep wages as low as possible for those who can reward departing politicos and bureaucrats by offering high-wage jobs.

Consider it an impossibility if you want but I believe the masses of common folks are becoming ripe for a much-needed Revolutionary War Two. Keep shoving the common citizens into an economic quagmire and do not be surprised if We, the People strike back in a manner that the Founders advised us if confronted by tyranny.

Many of us are military veterans who fought the wars started by politicians and as described by General Butler in his "War is a Racket" essay wars to assist the corporate entities. Will the standing military fire upon their fellow citizens or will they turn those bayonets around and subdue the tyrannical forces infesting all levels of government and the USA as a whole?

Consider the ramifications if the tyrants and their lackeys continue what is an ongoing class war against the mass of citizenry. The unholy alliance between big government and big business must come to an end. Will the ongoing actions of tyranny lead to what future historians will likely label Revolutionary War Two or will you tyrants and their lackeys get wise and consider the good of the common citizens for a change?

The choice is yours.
