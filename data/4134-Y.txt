The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S. If they just go home and make contribution to their own country, it will be a great loss for the US. After all they have made an effort to cultivate foreign students, and such effort can be used to culativate US students instead.
