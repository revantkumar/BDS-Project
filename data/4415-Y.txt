Serene Lan I strongly SUPPORT this proposed rule for the following reasons:

1) The rule will not effect the employment rate of US citizens. On the contrary, the competitive atmosphere will encourage both US and international students to enhance themselves theoretically and practically, and be more qualified at work. As a result, an average higher level of employees will definitely improve the environment of the job market, which is also beneficial for the US society.

2) The STEM students usually have obtained master or PhD degrees with strong technical ability and well-educated background. They will make great contributions to American companies and factories if they have opportunities and time to work in US. They stimulate the growth of American economy at certain degree.

3) The rule only proposes to expand the time of OPT for the STEM students, and if the STEM students decide to work in non-tech areas, they will break the laws. That is to say, the extension will not effect US students in other fields.

Therefore, I think it is a WIN-WIN strategy for both US and international STEM students.
