I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons.

1. Foreign students stay and study in the US university, and their goal is to continue to make contributions to the U.S. And they are a main component for U.S diversity, and are bringing talents and various element into the industry.

2. Though it's true that competition does exist, it's not a bad idea. Competition could help us to have better talents especially for some fields like IT technologies. And they're not competing with native US students who may prefer to choose communication-focused career, like sociologist, lawyer, doctors.
