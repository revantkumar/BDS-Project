Well, I think this proposal is going to create a win-win situation both for international students and the whole American society. First, international students can keep their lifestyles in America for a loner time. Meanwhile, they could gain more working experiences. This is still helpful even though they return to their home countries to seek for more promoted positions. I addition, this new proposal would let the American society work more efficiently due to international students' more hard-working personality.
