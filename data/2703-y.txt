Jimmy Zheng I believe OPT extension could bring more talents to the states.

I worked for an U.S. based IT company in China for several year, but now I work for a media company in NYC, after I finished a master degree in the United States. I believe people like me, who work hard to make their living, are following the same American spirit and make their own and solid contribution to the country.

Granted, not everybody is like Einstein who could bring significant benefit to the county, but people with STEM degree are the backbone of the society - they are well educated, well skilled, and well adapted to the US culture. With the OPT extension they could have more opportunity to work in U.S., and bring more value to the country.
