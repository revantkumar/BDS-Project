Regarding the proposed rule by DHS to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program:
Why does the Federal government, in general and the DHS in this case, inexplicably continue to favor foreign workers and foreign college STEM graduates over American workers and American STEM college graduates? This is not what OPT was intended to be.

There is a tremendous over supply of labor because of illegal and legal immigration together and the OPT program adds to that. We must get Americans employed first and increase the "labor participation rate."

The OPT program, as I understand, is available to any foreigner who wants to attend school in the U.S. Just a reminder, the 911 terrorists would have qualified under this program. That puts Americans in harms way. An important reason to get rid of the OPT program altogether.
