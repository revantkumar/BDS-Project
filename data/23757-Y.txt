I support the proposal. Employers in America will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. 
It is a known fact that some developing countries are becoming main force to push forward the global economy. These developing counties have a huge population, that is huge market. Having OPT STEM students work for American companies can help companies to have a better understanding of the potential international market. Companies such as Google, Facebook not only hire a lot of STEM OPT students, they even hire talents directly from other countries to come to work in America. Clearly employers have seen the value of these international employees.
