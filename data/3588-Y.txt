Jean Rea RE:DHS Docket No. ICEB-2016-0002 Public Comment
As a retired person now living on Social Security, I am convinced this proposed rule would be harmful to Medicare into which I have paid my share over many years. Foreign former students who stay in our country to work do not pay into any of our social programs, and neither do their employers pay for their foreign employees. This gives an unfair advantage to foreigners over U.S. graduates in these fields. The employment of a U.S. graduate would help our country's social programs as well as our employment rate. The lopsided wage advantage for foreigners will discourage U.S. students from choosing these fields in the future and this will not serve our homeland's future security well. It is enough to allow foreigners to be educated in our colleges. After graduation they should promptly leave to help their own countries. Our DHS should work for the good of the people of our country and not bow down under pressure from big businesses wanting only to keep more money for themselves. Please no shameful treatment of the young and old citizens of the U.S.A. 
With sincere concern, Jean
