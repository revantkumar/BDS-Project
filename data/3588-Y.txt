Strongly support the reform update.

The proposed rule (and even the previous rule) is in no way anti-citizen or by no means leads to American workers being fired or replaced by immigrants. American economy thrives on open market competition and capitalism. America has been preaching that to gain access to other economies around the world.

- protect F1 Students from being exploited. Like companies who ask them to take lesser rates/salaries in favor of H1B filing. By allowing F1 EAD students to be able to self apply their H1B applications throughout the year (like for certain H1B applications where immigrant is working for educational research institute etc) in an easy way (probably filling an online application) would greatly reduce this scheme. Merging the path of F1 EAD holders with Employment based H1B category makes these students (mostly very young and slightly less experienced) vulnerable thus allowing companies to take advantage of their vulnerabilities. This loophole is the main culprit that creates a financial incentive for companies to fire american workers and hire immigrant workers.
