I strongly agree to preserve STEM extension policies and even increase the extension period, for two major reasons. First, there are more job positions than candidates with citizenship in many fields. Without STEM extension, many high tech companies will not be able to fill their openings, which will significantly influence our economy. Second, OPT STEM is not a green card or citizenship. Students with OPT will finally need to go back to their own countries. As long as we control the H1B quota, STEM extension is not likely to cause immigration problems. Therefore, I think STEM extension is totally good for our society.
