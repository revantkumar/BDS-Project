Eric Doyle I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension. This rule is for the countrys own good!

1. International students make huge contribution to the development of science and technology in the US. There are so many great people in the history were foreigners. They use their talents to invent new technologies and promote the social development. Thats why our country is so strong. The country is proud of its inclusive. If we shut down the door to these talented people, we will just lose the talents to our competitor countries, and thats definitely what we do not want!

2. It is NOT true that international student steal jobs from citizens. Citizens already have huge advantages in job markets, thanks to their citizenship and language advantage. Why would companies still bother to hire foreign students and sponsor their visas? Thats because they are qualified for the jobs and bring huge potential benefits to the companies. Even if they were driven out of the country and the companies could not find enough talents, the companies would not lower the bar and hire unqualified candidates. They would just outsource the work to other countries with lower cost. And that will directly increase unemployment rate! Think with your head people!
