I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT policy, because these who are opposing this policy did not bring up valid points and I do not want these comments cause problems for such a great policy.

Firstly, foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX and they help local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge loss.Those property renting, food service and other industries will face huge loss.

Secondly, here is no guarantee how long it will take and how much it will cost to train all US students to fully compensate loss of foreign students. Without this policy, numerous companies in the United States will face serious shortage of STEM workers suddenly and tremendous loss. Foreign students are making the best and most contributions to their employers and they are all very hard-working. They make all that happen such as developing new technologies to benefit the whole mankind. 

Therefore, I highly support this new policy and really hope this could be APPROVED!!!!
