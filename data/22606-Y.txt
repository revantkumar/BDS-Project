I wholeheartedly support this ruling which helps extend the OPT period for STEM researchers. As a postdoctoral researcher working at one of the best engineering universities in the world (Georgia Tech), from purely scientific perspective it is virtually impossible to complete any research in the field I work in (oil & energy), within the period of single year. The two year extension would be greatly beneficial to me and to the US economy since the the work which I perform would greatly enhance the profitability and productivity of a major US petrochemical company. 

If you would ask me to change or modify one thing in this ruling, I would try to distinguish between PhD and Masters students. The former do more rigorous research activities which usually take a longer time (3-5 years). Separation between these two categories (i.e. giving more OPT time for PhD students) would also help appease to the domestic workforce whose jobs are apparently being affected by foreign nationals who have Master's degrees (especially in the IT/computers field).

In the end, I applaud everyone at DHS for coming up with this rule in a record amount of time and satisfying the concerns of everyone involved.
