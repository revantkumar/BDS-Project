Dear DHS,
Please approve the OPT STEM extension regulation. 
STEM OPT extension is a win-win situation. Let's talk about the insights of the rules. The rule is not taking the jobs from US citizen. The employers would not replace the US worker. The employer has to maintain a document to proof the eligibility of the STEM employee. Let's give an example of the qualification of a STEM graduate: one of the founders of a billion dollar company in India was a STEM graduate from USA. Not only one, I can give a million examples of the highly qualified STEM graduates. They learn the latest technology from the top rank universities, and apply the skills to the US companies. The students do contribute to the innovation that has a huge impact to the US companies. Most of them are coming here for higher study (MS or Phd). Think about the students who are coming with a full scholarship to the top rank universities such as UC Berkley, MIT, Harvard, Stanford, and so on. The graduates are more qualified than the people coming with H1B visa from other countries.

Is it possible to reduce paperwork for DSO as well as employer? What are the options for the students who have a STEM extension for 17 months, and will be expiring in January 2016?
