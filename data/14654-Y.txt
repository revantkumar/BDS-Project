Although I don't want to believe it, I think companies who hire those students are doing so because it's cost-effective rather than for altruistic reasons. I believe that the way to right this wrong is to force companies to look first for qualified U.S. citizens. Step two, if the pool of qualified applicants is insufficient, is to accept applications from green card holders. Step 3, foreign students would be considered only if their credentials and experience exceed those of citizen applicants. This would be closely monitored by the Department of Labor with any company caught cheating receiving a significant fine. Perhaps such a policy would light a fire under our own students to develop the skills needed to compete with dedicated motivated foreign applicants. Let's roll, American STEM students! I love diversity but not at the expense of our own workers so companies can save a buck on benefits and other costs.
