I strongly support this ruling for extending the F1- OPT period. 

STEM students are the cream of the crop. The U.S. currently enjoys a significant share of the world's brightest Engineers. Contrary to what people suggest, these engineers contribute hugely to the growing industries and hence the economy in total. Reducing OPT would NOT create more jobs for Americans, but will in fact ruin the technological edge that the U.S. currently enjoys, and in return make less jobs available for everybody. 

STEM students are not cheap labor, and will not work for a lower wage than their peers. This falsifies the claim that immigrants lower any kind of wages. In fact, other countries, China, India, Canada, also offer high salaries to skilled stem workers. The truth is STEM students are currently choosing the U.S. because the U.S. offers high quality education and the hints of a bright future in a great country. However, if that future is tainted by the looming prospect of a speedy removal from the country, people will leave. This loss will be irreversible. 

Finally, the U.S. education system depends on this. Good schools are only as good as the people in them. The fact is that a significant portion of students and faculties alike are and were once foreigners. Not extending the OPT period will make the U.S. MUCH less of an appealing choice for their education as well as research. 

So, with all sincerity at heart, please extend the OPT period. Do not let this country become lesser due to some narrow minded bigotry.
