The now obvious BIG LIE to American workers was that "Free Trade" would cost us manufacturing jobs but our higher educational level would mean those displaced would be able to move up to better paying technology jobs. But now the-powers-that-be are doing all they can to take those jobs from us BY BRINGING IN PEOPLE FROM THE COUNTRIES THAT TOOK THE FACTORY JOBS and GIVING them the training to be able to take the tech jobs too, at ever lower salaries. Who is going to be the market for products or services when salaries around the world are $2.00 an hour? Who's going to fund our government when we're all displaced workers? How does any sane person see this actually working?!
