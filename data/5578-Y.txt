I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. A lot of international students have high salary and their jobs do not fit the residents. Competition can help the U.S. have more talents and increase the average salary of all the persons, including local students and international students.

2. The U.S. need the freshmen.

3. The international students spend lots money in the U.S., and the expanding OPT is interesting to them.
