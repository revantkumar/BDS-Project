To Whom It May Concern,

I would like to say something about STEM 24-months extension. I'm a international student who has Chemical Engineering Master degree and currently has a analysis assistant job in Houston. I really love this job because it gives me valuable experiences in chemical engineering industry. The 17-months extension is too short for me to know about this field completely. I'm sincerely hope that 24-months extension could replace currently 17-months extension. Thank you.

Best Regards,

Di.
