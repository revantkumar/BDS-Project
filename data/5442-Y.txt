Rajat Bansal I strongly support this role. This will be an enabler for international STEM students to get real world experience and apply concepts learnt at US school to solve real world problems. International students have contributed billions to US economy by paying higher tuition than domestic students and so many of them have taken education loans back home. This rule will enable them to pay off their debt and also contribute to US economy in the tech sector. This rule will also attract more foreign students in future which is great for US economy. Its a win win situation for all.
