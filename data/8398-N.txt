This new regulation is wrong. It was never authorized by congress. Just in recent months, many American companies have displaced their IT work staff's with cheap foreign labor. Why would the American government work against the people of the United States which it was elected to serve? There are many veterans coming home from overseas and due to sequester and this administration are being forced off active duty and many are pursuing careers in the IT field. Why not hire veterans to fill any new IT jobs. What greater investment can this government make towards those it owes the most?
