The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..
Also diversity is one of the biggest features of United State of America. 
I believe that a lot of international students in STEM are very talented and I can't see why the government shouldn't give those talented young people more opportunity to make contribution to this country. 
I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained STEM degree.
