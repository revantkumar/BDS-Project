Sachin Srivastava Dear Sir,

We are coming to USA and spending a lot of money for our studies and taking huge student loans to pay the universities. Some of the parents have to take out their life savings so that their children can get good education. We are taking this risk for better career prospects for ourselves. If we don't get this opportunity it will be devastating to most of the students at the beginning of their career itself because it is not possible to recover from this kind of loan earning a salary at our native countries. Its also important that we can have a good work experience in USA so that we can get good opportunities back home. Also most of the companies in USA are not willing to employ foreign citizens. This is because they don't want employees for a short time period. Without the assurance of how long the employee will be in their company, most companies completely avoid hiring foreign students. Even from the companies point of view they need to have a substantial time period so that they can train the students and benefit from the investment they are making in hiring and training new graduates. I highly appreciate the proposed rule for this reason. This is a good extension and it will save a lot of students who otherwise could get trapped in great financial difficulties from which they can never recover.

Thank you and Regards
