Francis Guan I strongly support to extend the OPT period to longer, because those projects related with STEM areas tend to be longer than 1 year. To international students, just having the experience of studying at a foreign school is not a complete package of studying abroad. Most of them would like to have some hands on experience to actually apply what they learned at school to real world. When they go back to their home country, this kind of degree + work experience will enlight their future better. Without of gaining the work experience opportunity, or less chance of getting it. International students will choose some other countries to be safe to realize their goals. Such immigrant country like US should set up a role model, open and welcome talents like them from other countries, and provide them with this kinds of opportunities, in order to realize a win-win situation. This is how a strong country like US should react.
