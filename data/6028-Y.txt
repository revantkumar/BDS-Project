Patty Peng I would strongly support the new OPT extension policy. The policy would help OPT candidates increase their success in the H1B lottery, or give those who don't want to stay in US forever the opportunity to work 2-3 years here. 

Most of the STEM students will work in high-tech companies, which means it doesn't hurt the job searching for *normal US citizens*. The prosperity of US highly depends on those technology companies, and STEM OPT candidates can provide great work for them, from software engineer to hardware engineer. This is a WIN - WIN policy and I can't come up with any words to opposite it.
