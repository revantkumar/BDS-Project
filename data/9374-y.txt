Yuan Gong I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. It can attract many more outstanding international students come to America and make contributions.
2. International students won't affect Americans' salary because many companies have attended the E-verify program. It protects everyone's benefits.
3. More STEM students can keep America competitive in the aspect of Mechanical, IT, oil& gas and so on.
4. 12 months is not enough for research and projects, it will affect companies' benefits.
