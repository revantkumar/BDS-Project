I fully support this rule as one reason of US possesses this great amount of economy is they gathered a great amount of well-educated and brilliant minds. Talent people, as we know, is the most significant component to benefit a company, even a country in nowadays quick-paced everlasting changing world. Especially for high-tech fields, we cannot emphasize the importance of creative minds. This OPT new rule definitely will retain more educated talent people in US.
Nor will talent people only make profit for their own company. Many PhD students, even Masters have their own IP. Many of them used or will use the ideas to establish startup company. This, instead of taking natives jobs, will create more job opportunities for US.
To conclude, it is a very good proposal to extend the OPT by 24 months. It totally will have a positive impact on US economy.
