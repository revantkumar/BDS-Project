This is a great policy which not only enables foreign young talents to continue their American dream but also helps all the American companies to recruit the best employees they need without worrying about tedious immigrant procedure, like H1b and green card. It doesn't make sense to let all these young talents go after they get educated with American education resources. This policy allow the American society to harvest what they plant in the first place.
