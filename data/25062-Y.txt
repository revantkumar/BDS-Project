Every year, there are so many Computer Science/Tech jobs aren't filled with qualified candidates. Companies need those who have special skills to help them grow stronger and better.

What helps the economy grow? The skill workers definitely one of those factors. If the STEM extension stops, less and less students would want to head to the United States for education. It would be a big loss for most of the companies all the sudden. Who would be taking over the job positions? Not a lot of people study those fields, plus it will cost lots of time for companies to hire new people, train them. What a waste!!!

What makes United States different from the other countries? The culture diversity, variety ethnicity and the outstanding companies/economy. Those students study & get knowledge from U.S., all they want to do is help the companies, apply their knowledge for better cause in the states. We sure wont harm the economy, but advance it to a better level!

Many countries welcome and value the skill workers so much, they provide the residency to them. The U.S., there are so many skilled workers like me already here, but we are getting kicked out. Its unbelievable.

Please help us, help the companies, help the U.S. economy SAVE SKILLED WORKERS!
