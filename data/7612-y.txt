Joan Kuehn I am against anymore H1B visas. We need to save jobs for American citizens who will pay into social security and Medicare for our future social security recipients. We have always been a successful nation, great inventors, and people who inviented computers, the internet send Facebook. I know we have plenty of smart Americans and who can do these jobs through proper education send training. Our colleges should be for legal and citizens first, not those outside of our country. Test scores are down in our schools....too many uneducated and non-English speaking students. We need to stop illegal immigration and reduce legal immigration. We are over-populated in this country. Let's preserve our culture for future generations.
