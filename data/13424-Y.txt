As a potential student, I totally support this proposal and I think US government should expanding training oppotunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students. 
We Chinese student make continuous effort, taking TOEFLGRE exams, to go to US for further study, we are looking forward to studying in America, because we believe that America could provide us a free environment. And we can have a better career development. 

If the government canceled the extension of OPT, most international students and the whole country might suffer from great loss.

Most international students might lose internship opportunities. If we lose these chance, how can we develop competitive professional ability and skill.
and furthermore, going to US might no longer attract international students.
We might be more inclined to study in other counties, like Austrilia or Canada. 

Some native American might say international students take their job chance, and chinese students are too competetive in job market, making them lose job chance. But I think the job competition between native Americans and international students are good for the whole country's long-term development. a country like USA, with such large diversity and acceptance to foreigners, can only grow stronger via different talents' effort. If USA constrains other international students professional development, the USA itself would also suffer from stagnation in Tech and Science.
