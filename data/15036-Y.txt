I am very sorry to hear that instead of training the American Citizens , the economy including universities and USCIS is relying on the Foreign Students for the deficit budgets

OPT should be limited to 12 months to protect the American Workers. DHS and USCIS should more closely scrutinize and request all OPT's should submit the results of OPT and determine whether it is beneficial to the American Citizens not the American Companies

Don't outsource the future of American Citizens. Protect the American Citizens like the Natural resources.

Further, every OPT should provide their valuable contribution during the OPT application. If they cannot justify their contributions, they need to leave.

Don't outsource the future of the country
