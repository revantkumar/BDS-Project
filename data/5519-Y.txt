Yi Shi I firmly support this extension rule and I want to cite the report about how international students contribute to the US and thus
if the rule is cancelled, it will significantly discourage international students to come to US to study and the US will be hurt mostly.

the link is given here:http://www.iie.org/en/Who-We-Are/News-and-Events/Press-Center/Press-Releases/2015/2015-11-16-Open-Doors-Data

several points from the report:

"The continued growth in international students coming to the U.S. for higher education has a significant positive economic impact. International students contributed more than $30 billion to the U.S. economy in 2014, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce."

This shows how important the inflow of international students is to US economy.

"Open Doors 2015 reports that about 73 percent of all international students receive the majority of their funds from sources outside of the United States, including personal and family sources as well as assistance from their home country governments or universities."

This refutes the claim that "foreign students take up education funds", In contrast, foreign students give money to US.

"Students from around the world who study in the United States also contribute to America's scientific and technical research and bring international perspectives into U.S. classrooms, helping prepare American students for global careers, and often lead to longer-term business relationships and economic benefits."

This refutes the claim that "US domestic students should receive more attention than foreigners". In contrast, if foreign students leave, US education system and US domestic students will suffer huge loss
