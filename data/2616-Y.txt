It's ridiculous to say Foreign students study and work in the U.S on the expense of citizens. F1 students pay the same with citizens in private school, and pay much more in public school. There's already system to avoid non-tax payer taking advantage of payer. You job goes away is not because of the immigration policy, but of that most of the F1 students are elites from other countries. Many average foreign students can not find a job even under recent OPT program. The determinants are the skill and ability to make great contribution.
