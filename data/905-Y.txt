I support this proposal. 

Firstly, to boost the economic and scientific development, the U.S needs more high-educated and qualified scholars especially in STEM areas. 

Although it is true it would be easier for Americans finding a job, if intern students were sent back after graduating. However, the decreasing competition would result in worse employee resources. Only qualified engineers are needed for companies, why don't you study or work harder to improve your competitiveness rather than place hope on reducing rivals

Actually, I believe more and more international students do not intend to stay here forever. Most of them just want to work here for several years, maybe just one or two years, and then come back to their hometown. Just because if you have both of the working and studying experience abroad rather than just studying, it would be more easier to find a job when they go back to homeland. So it won't rob a lot opportunities from Americans.

It seems that this policy are beneficial to both the U.S and international students.
