The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country at least for a while and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. As a result, they can apply the school knowledge into real work. The advanced and mature companies and research institutes are one of the primary reasons that those students decide to study in the U.S.
