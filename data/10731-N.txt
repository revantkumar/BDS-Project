This all needs to stop! A sneaky government is not what the American people want nor what we would vote for. I understand these foreign countries and their people are impoveshed but there are many American citizens who are as well. The senior citizens are starving and are not even able to even purchase their own meds, make decisions whether to eat or get their meds. Problems in the U.S. need to be addressed before any more handouts, PLEASE!
And yes, I am speaking for myself as well. Our country has lost its morale. Put the money and energy into the people on welfare, Am. citizens first, then others. Build the country, it too is starving.
