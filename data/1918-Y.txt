Randy Johnson It's bad enough the Captains of Industry send American jobs overseas....they turn around and IMPORT labor (educating/training them FIRST, at taxpayer expense in many cases), then give them extended time to take away jobs Americans should be doing! Great foreign policy if you'd like to bring terrorists into the country under the flag of "advanced education".....are the people running our federal government (setting such policy) trying to atone for the invasion of so many foreign entities (to essentially take oil for domestic use)? 

Sponsoring this level of immigration also presents the quandary of how people who emigrate to this country will be treated (depends on the program? Why should tech-trained be treated different from those engaged in groundskeeping etc.?). Does this mean these 36-month employees can be discarded/rounded up and deported once their work time is over? Doesn't this lead to a good deal of resentment on the part of these people, who think this nation's streets are paved w/gold (compared to the countries they came from)? Does the term "exploitation" apply here? Yes, opportunity for the wealthy to steal the services of uninformed/abused international labor....more proof that our government has been hijacked by the corporatists who have paid for ALMOST all of Congress (and apparently the President (who never met a "trade agreement" he didn't like) buys into this as well. I guess we'll be looking back rather at the shame this administration has brought on us as Americans as they've merely extended the Bush years in far too many ways.
