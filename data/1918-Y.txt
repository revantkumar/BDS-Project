I strongly support the 24-month STEM OPT.

Someone who objects the extension of OPT say that foreign students take 
away jobs and do not pay tax. As a non-resident alien post-doctoral scholar,
I can firmly say foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX and they help 
local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and research 
institutions will face huge loss. The business like apartments, food services 
and other industries will face huge loss.

Someone may argue why not invest in US students more instead of recruiting
foreign students. However, there is no guarantee how long it will take and
how much it will cost to train all US students to fully compensate loss of
foreign students. At the same time, foreign students are paying large amount
of tuitions to colleges, which is supporting the universities financially.
After paying this large amount of money, how can you cruelly take away their
opportunity to work in US?
