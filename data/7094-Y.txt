I fully support the proposal with the consideration of the following reason. US is one of the most inclusive countries in the world and attract quite a lot of talents because of its diversity. If the proposal does not pass eventually, I believe that a lot of talents with F-1 visas would be enforced to leave. It would be tragic if this happens to a capable F-1 nonimmigrant student, see Mike Krieger, one of the co-founders of Instagram as an example.
