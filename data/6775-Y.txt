I support this proposal. From the perspective of educational institutes, the OPT extension policy would attract more international STEM students to study in the U.S. Most of the students are pursuing master's degree from whose tuition fees the universities can continue their research. If OPT extension is cancelled, the universities and educational institutes would not hardly attract those students. Then, they would suffer a lot from lack of money. Plus, U.S. high-tech companies benefit a lot from the contributions from international STEM students. If the students cannot stay longer here, a lot of companies would face talents loss, and finally the financial decline. In sum, extend OPT would benefit educational institutes, companies, and all the people related to this.
