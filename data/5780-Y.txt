I strongly support STEM OPT extension to 24 months. But i think this is a temporary fix to the existing larger issue of going through lottery system to work here in US.Its sad to see that people like myself who have 5-6 years of experience and a STEM masters degree from reputed university in US and working for one of top Fortune 50 firms have to go through a system which is absolutely not based on merit whatsoever.

This is will only hurt US in the long term in terms of economy and the kind of people who want to live,study or work and contribute to this great nation.When I came to this country i thought people with merit will be given due credit, but turns out to be entirely wrong.Sad to say but "american Dream" simply doesn't exist anymore for some of us, where one with hardwork and dedication could have got you where one wants to be.
