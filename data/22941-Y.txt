I am one of the benefician of OPT Extension. Also most people like me have made great contribution to the US during our OPT period. I don't think there would be an interest conflict with native graduates. From my knowledge, most of students from STEM could find a job, no matter International or native students. However the ratio of International students is obviously higher than native students. As a result, these international students take a lot of responsibility in corresponding job market , and they need status support from the U.S.. I strongly support OPT extension decision, because it's a win-win for both United States and we international students.
