I believe quite a few people in US, especially anti-immigration groups, are not really aware what international STEM students bring to this country's innovation and development, which are definitely not individual benefits, but a support to the whole society. It's just so unfair to expel a group of people while taking advantage of the intelligence and progress they have made.

Looking through around the world, the US may be the most energetic, diverse and open-minded society. And this is exactly why many US citizens are proud of their motherlandand may be the most widely known tags of "American spirit". More importantly, this feature is a strong attraction to the world smartest people keeping coming to this land. People from different fields of world bring various minds and cultures, and the blend of minds usually leads to unbelievable ideas. Without such a variety, I'm afraid our brilliant technology changes will get slower and slower.
