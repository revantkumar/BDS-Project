Until ALL work capable Americans are employed and off the dole, importing employees is a fiscally irresponsible action. If there are job openings available that do not have enough Americans trained to do them, it is time to spend the money retraining Americans to fill those positions instead of importing more people to add to our population. Re-educate, re-fill our employment coffers, and re-use Americans to make our nation strong again and re-fill our tax coffers instead of destroying our country from within and betraying our own people. A nation of able bodied people should not sit idly by on the unemployment and welfare lines while those who have no allegiance to this country reap the rewards and contribute nothing.
