This policy is awesome without doubt!
Let's review the history of World War II, when German persecuted Jews, a lot of Jews flee the country, including a bunch of brilliant scientist. Albert Einstein is one of the smartest scientists, which lead the nuclear weapon project. Thanks to this project, USA can end the war without paying too many soldiers lives. Think about this, if Einstein used OPT to work in the USA without extension, and cannot get a valid work visa when OPT runs out, then he will be deported from USA. Then the history would be changed. Not only Einstein, a lot of intelligent people came to US every year to make this country more and more prosperous.
I cannot think of a reason why dont make these talented person stays at US longer!
