Chunyang Zhu I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. university in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, a lot of famous scientists were international students before they became famous.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Companies only hire international students when they could not find suitable local people. 

Therefore, from the view of long-term benefit, by offering the 24 months extension of OPT will be meaningful for the country, and good for the economy.
