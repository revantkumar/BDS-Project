If I were a USA citizen I would be very skeptic of such an extension and would further investigate why this is good for USA. There are a lot of benefits for Americans as a consequence of this bill. At least half a million students from across the globe come to USA for higher studies. They contribute 0.5 million * 30,000 dollars into the American economy. 
Not all students get jobs and struggle to find more income. Providing an extension only makes it easier for all students to reduce their student debt and contribute more to your economy. They stay here buy your products, purchase your houses and contribute to make USA stronger on the global map. 
The popular counter argument is eligible Americans are losing jobs because of international students. But how is that even possible. If an American is interviewing both international and American students and employing more international at the same pay and benefits then that means American students are lacking something. Removing international competition will not help Americans at all because the business will be shifted across the globe. By driving people to US the government is skillfully creating more jobs here and keeping American economy safe.
Btw I am an Indian student applying for OPT.
