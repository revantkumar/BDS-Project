Jingtong Liu As a country of immigration, US has always been and will highly welcome new immigration from all over the world for 200 years, especially well educated people. And everyone created equal, no matter where they are born. The Us government is of the people, for the people ,and by the people. This OPT improving and expanding document is the best evidence for this spirit.

As the one of the best developed country, millions of international students come to US for higher level education. After the training, we really want them to stay here and use what they have learn contribute to this country. Among them, the STEM students are of great value. Most of these students are working hard in areas of high technology, and less American student are willing to study. In research area and industries, we have large amount of well educated openings. Only Americans are not enough. And this policy is benefit for them to stay here and continue doing the research, and what is more will benefit ourselves in the near feature.

Truly, this policy will affect the native Americans' opportunity in these area at this moment. However, if think it over again, it also will arouse nationals' initiative by the international scientists' competition. In this case, instead of being afraid of them and forbidden the coming challenge, we should be confident of ourselves. We are the master of this land, and they just come here for few years. These students will become American as we are now and renew the blood of the US. Also the Government also have other policies to protect the right of all the citizens, so no need to worry.
