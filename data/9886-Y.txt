I strongly support this rule for various reasons. However I would like to mention the below 2 major reasons here.

1. A student's MS is not complete with out proper OPT. An advanced degree in STEM would make more sense with good amount of OPT, which should be for at least 3 years.

2. In case this rule does not pass through, it will hurt the US economy badly as the best talent of the world will leave USA and may not opt to educate in USA in future. This will definitely hurt back USA very badly.

So please pass this "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students" rule as it is.
