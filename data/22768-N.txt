America needs LEGAL IMMIGRATION of TRAINED, EMPLOYABLE workers, not uneducated indigents to gain political favor. If we continue to ignore existing laws, and import people AGAINST OUR LAWS, for political gain, we will LOSE our nation and its HERITAGE. ALL BUT 2 NATIONS HAVE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP, AND ALL NATIONS ENFORCE THEIR OWN BORDERS. We are giving citizenship to babies who have NO citizen parent, and we are allowing people to come here BREAKING OUR LAWS and REFUSING to deport even criminals. we are bankrupting our nation by giving welfare and health benefits to people who are NOT here legally, and allowing them to WORK, DRIVE, and get unlimited social benefits. We MUST enforce the existing laws, and these people need to GO HOME and fight for, live in, participate in their own homelands. People who come here illegally and have no plans to assimilate or become legal citizens are no longer welcome.
