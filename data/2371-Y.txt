I strongly support extending OPT to 24 months. This benefits both international students and the U.S. Most students in STEM have financial support from the U.S. So it is the US paying to educate these young researchers and scientists. It doesn't make sense to stop STEM students from making contribution to the U.S. when this country has devoted so much effort in education.
