I think it is necessary for Internet Industry to keep OPT extension.
For some reason, the possibility for those talented guys to get H1b visa is not that high. But Internet companies need large amount of engineers. Although they can hire them in India or China with less money, but they can't work during the daytime in US, which is midnight in their countries. So every progress will be delayed for at least 12 hours or even more, it is nightmare for the companies which is catching up some projects.
There are also some genius from all over the world who is creating amazing products in US to change the world, they might create similar things in their country, but US give them chance to make this products influence the world by working with other guys from other countries! Don't you think they should be given more chance to draw their H1b visa?
What's more, with these talented guys, it will be more great companies and more job positions for others, these guys need service, need cook, need to buy food, need to repair their cars. It will make good effect for more working positions and better economical development.
That's all I want to say.
Thanks,
