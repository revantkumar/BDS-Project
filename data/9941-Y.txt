I am strongly support the proposed expansion of the optional practical training (OPT) program. This program provides opportunities for international students learned from US that can work for US. Most foreign students working with OPT got higher education using US resources, it is time for them to pay back. Besides, limiting legal immigration will not benefit the US citizens, only limiting illegal immigration does.
