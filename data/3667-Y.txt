It's been lightning clear for quite some time that Obama has been working at cross purposes to America's tax-paying citizens by inviting hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, too many of them criminals their own countries were glad to be rid of, Among them are huge numbers of dangerous terrorists, more who will be infiltrating the hundreds of thousands (again) of refugees due to come here. All will be given licenses, visas with attached voter registrations and now you know the reason why Obama set this in motion. READI-MADE democratic voters, ta-daa! In conjunction with this cleverest of moves, we turn down the pipe line, a source of thousands of jobs, as if his decision had anything to do with climate control. It can't because the immensely lucrative offer will go to China who, SURPRISE, cares not a whit about the pollution it will send into orbit, so-to-speak, while we, who already sit squarely on our own wealth of fossil fuels, quite thrifty to use, and awesome in the jobs and income the US would have garnered, might even have gone a long way toward paying off the debt Obama made sure he increased by leaps and bounds. This will make his friends, who fail regularly in solar and wind making strides, very happy though the American consumer will be forced to go this very expensive route to their utility usage even though, to date, it's not ever been very effective. There you have it, America, we are screwed yet again by the man purported to be weak & not very bright. I have pointed out that this is not true, he's known, from the beginning, exactly what he's doing. This is just the beginning of a country, beginning to learn a minute portion of what the future will bring.
