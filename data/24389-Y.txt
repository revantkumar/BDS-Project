As a STEM graduate, I am using the 17-month extension right now. From my point of view, the extension is beneficial to both international STEM graduates and US employers. 
I started working for a renowned non-profit medical research institution after I graduated last September. I was assigned several projects immediately after I joined. As a lot non-STEM people may not know, scientific projects are time-consuming. Researchers usually have to spend years searching in the dark until something shining is discovered. As for me, my projects only started to become promising until after I applied for the OPT extension. These projects have so far helped my lab publish two papers in high-impact scientific journals and get more funding from the government to continue our research. With that being said, I think the OPT extension not only is good for individuals and the government, but also for the greater public, as it buys time for valuable scientific findings.
