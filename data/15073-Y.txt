I am in approval of the OPT rule and OPT extension. On a personal level it allows my son to stay legally in the USA with his family who came to the USA in 1991 on an E2 Visa. He is 24 years old and has been in the USA legally since he was four months old. He currently has 8 years wait for a green card number. He has a degree in Geology, is highly intelligent and is a great asset to this country. By revoking the OPT and STEM extension the DHS will be sending this highly talented and productive USA educated young man to another country that will be competing economically with the USA. 
OPT, H1B visas and E2 Visa all bring in productive people to the USA economy, however none of them lead to permanent residency. People on these visa so desperately want to be part of America that they are good citizens, study and work hard and contribute more than the average person to the USA economy. If OPT was cancelled these students would look to other countries to take their talents.
The DHS are able to monitor these people and revoke visas if they do not play by the rules. These students DO NOT take jobs from USA citizens. As in my sons experience, many companies will not look at a foreign application if there are good applications from USA citizens. It is easier and less expensive for a company to employ a USA citizen and they are not subject to having the employee leave the job if they cannot obtain an H1B visa.
The USA should be helping to keep these people in the USA and should also be looking to provide a path to citizenship for these talented young people.
