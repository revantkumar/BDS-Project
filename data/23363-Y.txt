I am strongly support this new proposal. Students in the STEM majors are possessing valuable knowledge in mathematics, science, engineering and mechanics and these knowledge are really important to United States. In the past, the international students in these majors have already made a lot of contributions to the development of American economy. They have proposed many new ideas, methods, theories and and invented many new creations which have great significance to this country's development in technologies and science. Through their inventions and creations, people's life are becoming more and more convenient and even more jobs have also been created through their contributions. These international students did not hurt the benefits of natives', on the contrary, they did provide many benefits for natives. With the new proposal, these international students can have more time to take full advantages of their ability to create more and contribute more to United States.
