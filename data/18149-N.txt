Politicians want nothing more than a tax break for the companies they are invested in. We know Congress and the White House are looking after their own interest and paying their incurred "debts". We vote them out and the next bunch is just as bad and it doesn't matter the political party. Will just ONE in Congress have the conscience to stand against the destruction of our country and the AMERICAN PEOPLE? I doubt it, you are all in it together.
