I am an Elecrical Engineering student with opt extension right now. With the new policy I will contribute more to my company and my future career. We do need opt extension, as H1B is hard to get(lottery makes it hard!), we STEM students do need opt extension for better career path. You cannot blame opt takes Americans' job, out-sourcing is the one to blame. Opt students are trained in America, and work for America, we are fall more reliable than outsourcing workers. Please extend the opt, and it is a win-win solution.
