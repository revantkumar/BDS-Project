I strongly support the extension of STEM OPT.

As a STEM student, please understand that many of us may not intend to stay in the US for their whole life. However, we would appreciate a chance to work and contribute to the US society for a few years - while US companies can gain innovative ideas from people who are well-educated and with diversified ideas and we are having our skills trained. Without OPT, if we want to work in the US we need to apply for H1B directly(a more complicated process), meaning the employer have more bargain power to drive our wage lower. Therefore, an OPT extension can actually help remain the wage to a normal level. 

Moreover, the idea that STEM students are taking jobs from American citizens is ridiculous. In every job application, American students with similar background have privileges over foreign students and are always preferred by HR. We can have jobs only after American citizens of the same technical background attain jobs. We are not taking your jobs away!!! Btw, speaking a little bit of human right here, have you ever imagined what it feels like to be discriminated for our nationalities in every single job interview? 

And please do not ignore the contributions(especially technological innovations) we have contribute to the US society that actually create millions of jobs.
