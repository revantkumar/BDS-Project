Dear officer,

I support the OPT extension, and I appreciate the wise proposal. After reading through the comments, I see two problems of those who oppose the extension. 

First, people oppose the extension hold the opinion that OPT extension would reduce the working opportunity of U.S. citizens in tech industry. However, this is not true. Given the fact that tech industry is oriented by talent people, and the working style is very flexible, it is very common that a lot tech companies are working remotely to keep foreign talents nowadays. So the issue that U.S. citizens are facing when searching for tech jobs cannot be solved by objecting OPT Extension. It needs a separate solution. 

The second problem is that, even we have the 24 months extension, we international students do not have advantages while seeking for a career in the U.S., compared with U.S. citizens. Because we only have 24 months to find a job opportunity, but U.S. citizen have their whole life to find a job opportunity without worrying about their visa status. I think the extension is a kind wise decision because 24 months is a long enough time for us international students to begin a good enough career after graduate. If we only have one year to work in the U.S. after graduate, we will hurry up every stage of searching our first job, which is not good for employers and we international students.

For those who worry that we will stay in the U.S. by H1B lottery and might eventually become U.S. citizens, I think that is not a necessary consideration. America is an immigration country. If a foreigner works hard and finally get the citizenship through his or her great effort, it is not a bad thing to America: the country will get excellent citizens that will keep it strong in the world. This is called the American dream. 

Sincerely,
Yang Shen
