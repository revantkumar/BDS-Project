As an international student, I was in graduate school for fives years in Texas, earning a MS degree and a PhD degree. I investigated tons of money for the hard work. We are all seeking a bright future career, and wish to contribute to the technology development in both US and the whole world. The lawsuit on OPT extension really made me and people like me depressed on making progress for the whole field. On US side, to keep the talented and skilled international students is no doubt invaluable for science and technology development. This new proposal also protects US workers, and this is absolutely needed to be supported! Also, the new proposal gives us three years to think about career development, which is the right time duration. 24-month is right time for OPT extension. Besides protecting US workers as proposed, it also raises the competition ability of US workers and help with better communicating with and learning from international students. All these are definitely beneficial to the whole nation.
