I strongly support the rule proposed by DHS. It is really beneficial for both american society and international students.

First, extending the STEM opt does not mean that it will grab the job opportunity from American students. It is commonly recognized that American students are much more easy to find a job in STEM field than international student because of their language advantages over others. Employers will tend to hire American students who have the same education level than competitors.

Second, The STEM industry has much more position than those which American students could fill. As we know, High technology companies hire lots of international students and still have lots of opportunities for the public. American student won't worry about finding a job in these company if they had a related degree.

At last, Cutting the opt will cause the unemployment in lots of high technology companies and the American Industry will suffer a great loss from it. We all know that the well-educated international student from all over the world have made great contribution to the development of american economy over several decades. Cutting Opt will definately reduce the chance for them to stay in American and thus does no good for the economy of american society.
