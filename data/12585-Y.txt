My name is Chris, I got my IT Master degree in Valparaiso University on Dec 2013 in IN. 
I hope the Act of 24 months OPT replace 17 months can be accept.

1. Nothing change of H1B. For the past several years, more and more international students come to America. If people want to working in America that they need working permit in US. H1B and OPT can help most people on working permit. More and more people come to US, but the amount of H1B can not increase, that is a big issue. If H1B can not have change, I hope US Government can do something on OPT Act.

2. Save money for enterprise. For example, if a company hire 2 people for the same position. One person is H1B or American citizen and the other is OPT. Enterprise can pay less money for OPT instead of H1B or American citizen.

3. Growing Up. STEM major can help the world growing up. Enterprise needs growing up. Quality of people life growing up. Animal, plant growing up. Everything growing up. If STEM major cannot growing up, everything will be limit in a situation.
