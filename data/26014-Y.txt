My favorite NBA team is Spurs, which is one of the most successful NBA team in recent decades. You know what? Among the 15 players in Spurs, 9 of them are international players. Spurs always welcomes international players. And this is one of main reasons why Spurs receives so many respects! No doubt, NBA is the best basketball association in the world, just like the education system and the job market of US. The secrets that keep NBA highest-level is that it is open to the world and therefore it can attract the most talent players from the other countries. 

It is the same with the OPT too! It is the OPT extension that attracts the most talent international students to study in America. If America closes its door to international students, America will lose it competitiveness and international students will go to other countries such as German, Canada, China etc., which will greatly improve other countries education and economy.
