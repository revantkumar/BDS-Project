It is past time for OUR government to have at least as much compassion and concern for our own citizens as we do for foreigners.

The following observations by Professor Norm Matloff of UC Davis clearly state my opinion and beliefs regarding this program.

1. If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?
2.If workers with such training are indeed needed, why won't these special mentoring programs be open to Americans?
3. OPT expands the pool of YOUNG workers....this is the core of how SCE, Disney and so on can legally save lots of money by hiring foreign workers -- the latter are younger, thus, much cheaper, than the Americans they replace.
4. On a variety of measures, the former foreign students have talent lesser than, or equal to, their American peers.

Please cancel this further erosion of good opportunities for trained & qualified Americans.
