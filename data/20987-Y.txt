I think it's stupid to send people who're educated and trained in our universities, which are the best in the world, back to their country like if we could afford to lose them.
Most of these students are among the best in their home country, as well in the U.S. Many great people who contribute a lot to this country were international students. They are not cheap labor who's trying to take away minimum wage jobs. STEM students are highly trained tech workers who can help american industries keep competitive in the world, and help make more jobs.
For this extension, offering one-year OPT to international students is a subtle way to send them away. They could only get very limited experience from this short program and since it's hard and luck-dependent to get a H1B visa, most of them have to leave shortly. This short OPT can't get what it wants because longer duration is a must to complete some meaningful projects. For example, projects funded by NSF typically last up to three years. One-year OPT is not enough for meaningful training.
Also, international students contribute a lot to local economy. Many universities get along because of the out-state tuition paid by international students. Let alone the local apartment leasing, vehicle, etc. If OPT is only one year long, american universities will be much less attractive to international students, they'll be more willing to choose other countries.
I think everyone should support this policy.
