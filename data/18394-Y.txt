I strongly agree that we should expand OPT to 24 months. First, it is benefit to companies who hire OPT students. Usually, a company will spend money and time on training new hire F1 students. And the time usually 3 months to 6 months. Imagine the company spend half year on a F1 student, but after another half year, this student has to leave. This would be a tragedy to company. Someone argue that F1 students make the local Americans lost jobs. This doesn't make any sense. Most F1 students are master students, which means they have to spend their own money in America during their student life. Even if they get the job, they also need to pay the tax. Another reason is F1 student is cheap labor. If OPT is only one year, the company will lose many talents.
