This is simply not fair for the Americans who spend so much time and money in getting degrees to be simply replaced by foreign workers. I understand corporations need to make profits by hiring lower wage workers, but the government also needs to check that this should be fair and balanced on both sides. This simply mean that more Americans will be unemployed for a long time and if US is promoting STEM for American kids and on other hand giving STEM jobs to foreign students, it would create a sense of negativity in the mind of public. In fact US corporations need to balance the wages and hire more US citizens. Please do not try to demotivate current STEM students who will be looking for jobs in future. Make US strong in STEM and see the difference.
