I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitie can make more contribution to the country.

2. As we all know, the students from other countries really do excellent works in US history.

3. Only with competition can make better results for whole country. United States is built by people from all over the world. Students from other countries should have more opportunities to join.
