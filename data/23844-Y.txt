We are telling our children that they should study STEM so that they can be fully employed as adults. Here, in Rohnert Park, California, we have a separate high school called Technology High just for this reason. The kids work very hard at that school. Allowing foreign students to stay in our country and compete with American kids undermines and frustrates our and their efforts. This rule is being advanced because Mark Zuckerberg and similar others do not want to have to pay Americans six figures.
