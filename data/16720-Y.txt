I DO STRONGLY SUPPORT the OPT extension rule. I'm an international electrical engineering student. When I decided to study abroad, I had many options to purse my M.S. degree in many countries such as US, UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong.

The crucial reason that made me to study at here is US has an attractive industry training policy which is OPT and OPT extension. So OPT extension is extremely important to attract foreign STEM major talent students. Without the OPT extension, I cannot believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM major talent students to make contribute to US using their knowledge and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better industry training policy to foreign students. 

Finally, it is absolutely a huge disaster to US high-technology industry and most high-technology companies, which are supported by international STEM major students, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Intel.
