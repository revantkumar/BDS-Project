I strongly agree with an extension of OPT period for STEM students. 
Well-known and profitable tech companies (Google, Facebook, Apple) need a large group of graduated students have STEM degree. The TAX from these companies will eventually to all citizens. 

BTW, these companies would rather hire citizens once they qualify the positions.
For people worried about losing your own potential jobs, go home and think about one question "Do you QUALIFY those positions?"
These companies will hire you because you are good not because you are citizen.
