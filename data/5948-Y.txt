I support this proposal. Allowing F-1 nonimmigrant students to gain more training opportunities will benefit not only those students but also the US. Since the US universities have spent lots of time and resources cultivating the students, why not take full advantage of them? Let them get more training, and the students will be better and they will provide better work for community. I believe this proposal is positive.
