I totally agree with this DHS proposal. I'm a house owner in Seattle. All my tenants are international STEM students. Not only myself but all the members in my community welcome international STEM students to study here. They bring their knowledge and wealth to US. Our local economy also flourished by them. I hope we can keep them staying in this country.
