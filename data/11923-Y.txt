As an F-1 student in STEM field, I strongly support the proposed OPT 24-month extension policy and cap-gap relief. This policy is going to provide more professional training opportunities for international students in STEM fields who are excellent and smart enough to get hired for STEM-related jobs. This new policy will no doubt boost US economy since the international employees can contribute more, which is the very reason how they got the job in the competition with other candidates. 

If there is no OPT extension, a huge number of international employees will be forced to leave the country not because of their qualifications, but because of the H1B visa lottery cap. If this thing happen, you are ruling out all profit and benefits that US can get from hiring these people. 

In addition, a large proportion of international students in STEM field have scholarship when they attend graduate school in US. This means US has already paid some price to education these students. When they finally get their degrees, it is time for US to benefit from such educational investment by letting those of them who are capable of finding a STEM job stay in US and contribute to the economy. Simply chasing them back to their home country due to the OPT policy and H1B gap will do no good to US. It is like throwing money in the water. As far as economy is concerned, a rational decision always weighs cost and future benefit. Letting STEM students stay and work for US is the only way to gain from the educational investment that has already been spent on them out of US taxpayer's pocket. 

Please consider the above arguments and create opportunities for international students in STEM field to work in US, which is in the very benefit of this country.
