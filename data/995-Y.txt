I support this rule.

This rule will give fair job hunting chances for international students who have not got the H1 visa for just 2 more years, which stand up for the fairness and justice of U.S. government.

I don't believe this will impact the opportunities for Americans students much. In 2015, there are over 20 million students in U.S. who attend universities and colleges and from which only less than 1 million are international students.
