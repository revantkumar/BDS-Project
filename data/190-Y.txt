I think this is a really good initiative by u.s government. Actually most of foreign students will be in STEM fields because of the weakness of language and misunderstanding of the culture. The mainly jobs still provided for locals. While OPT gives an opportunity to international students to make some economic benefits for the United States. And those economic benefits do help the Unite States keep normal operation and offer more jobs to locals. The technical creations that international students make can also help the United States improve their living standards. 

Actually because the United States always be more kind and generous to combine different cultures, always try to use different ways to attract the most talented people from all around the world, so that it can become the most powerful and rich country.

Do not abolish the improving and expanding training opportunities, do not abolish the way how you make success and stay strong.
