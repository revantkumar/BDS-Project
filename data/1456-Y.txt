Strongly support the extension!

It will be a loss for US if there's no stem extension. According to my experience, the majority of the master students in stem program are international students. Without extension, half of the talented students have to go back to their home country, since the h1b lottery does not consider the quality or capability of the candidates. 

We need a fair competition in job market. Do the American students need protection from their government to compete against international students to get a job?

And as I know, many international students want to go back to their home country in the long run. Not all of them intend to immigrate.
