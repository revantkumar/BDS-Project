First of all, as I can see in my university, most of the graduate students in STEM field are international students and with small partial of U.S. citizens.We all know that every company need talent people for their further development, if we international students no longer have the OPT extensions, employers may not consider hiring an international student,which may lead to a huge lack of employers for these positions, and thus make the economy of these engineering company into a failure.
On the other hand, from the previous data of average salary summary, we can see that international students have a lower final income than citizens, that helps save a lot of money for those companies to hire an employer. Why U.S. government refuse to hire a talent person with outstanding skills with less payment?
Finally,as a fact, international students always work harder and most of them are very outstanding since they overcame a lot of difficulties to study abroad,most of them have strong abilities that lot of people may not have,such as strong independence and assiduous, I believe that they could build U.S.A much better with their knowledge and experience.
To sum up, I strongly support that the OPT extension policy could pass.
