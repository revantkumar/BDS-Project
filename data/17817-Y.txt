I just read several comments. I can see most of the positive comments towards the policy are more persuasive, while there are really comparatively more stupid and selfish negative comments to it. Most of the disapprovals implicitly express their fears of losing jobs and seemly inequity. Looks quite like cowards. 

Think about it. Most of the international students are adopted in their own country for most of their life time. Their countries have denoted tremendous amount of resources on them, but now, you can remain them in U.S. to work for you. And you don't even need to spend a lot. 

Furthermore, why do they want to come to U.S.? It's its open, freedom, and diverse environment to really make U.S. a strong country. Being afraid of the challenge and difficulty will only lead U.S. to go downhill. Try to refer to the history and re-think about it!
