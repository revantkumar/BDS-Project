I strongly support this propose. American have been the most attractive country in the world in previous, and many hi-tech people come here from all over the world to learn and to work here, companies prefer to hire american since they do not need to sponsor their visa, but for those international students they hire, they have been proved to be qualified for the job. Nowadays so many companies hired international student, if they are only allowed to be work here for one 1 year, many companies would suffer for their leave.
