I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International students get a job from a company only if company cannot find a suitable citizen to take it. So the proposal wont affect the citizens' employment.
