I believe longer the opt is a good news for American citizens.
Firstly, the job international student taking in the opt period mostly his or her first fulltime job. So American company only cost a little to hire a student who just graduates and armed with the most advanced technology.
More over, if opt is not longer and eventhough shorter, American Universities will be less attractive and universities and colleges will lose more than ten percent of total student who are full-pay international students.
