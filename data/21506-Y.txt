Who is looking out for American workers and the education of American students? Why is ICEB working to displace American workers?

As an American I oppose the existence and expansion of H-1B & OPT. The USA should be taking care of their citizens and their communities. The USA should be educating their citizens of all ages in the stem programs. In the last 20 years I have personally experienced the stagnation and decline of American wages due to the displacement by foreign students and workers. As a worker in the technology field I see corporations choosing to support workers that are willing to take less money. What family withholds an education from their own members to educate people that are not even citizens of their country? There is no benefit for American's to give up their education so that foreigners can take their jobs in their own country. Who is standing up for the education of the tax payers children? It is in the best interest of the world to continue to educate Americans. We have set the gold standard and should have the right in our own country to continue setting the bar. Expand educational opportunities in the stem fields for American citizens of all ages.

This rule threatens to undermine the sovereignty of the USA and further downgrade the abilities and opportunities for American workers.

I oppose the displacement of American workers.
