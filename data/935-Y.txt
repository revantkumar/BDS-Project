The opt should be extended with no hesitation. Think of a student from other countries who spend a lot of money and time to study here, and could not work for US and help US development. And if they could not get H1B, they need to be deported. Is this still the freedom spirit from the America? How could all the immigration be survived any more!? So it's necessary to give extension to OPT students and give them more chances. It wouldn't damage the benefits for local residence. There would be a lot of benefits for the development and company expanding.
