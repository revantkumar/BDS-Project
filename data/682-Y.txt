I am an international undergraduate student studying computer science and mathematics at U.S. college. I strongly support this new OPT extension rule.

When I planned to study abroad, I eventually decided to come to the United States rather than other possible countries because U.S. provides me the best opportunity to work in the real industry and have industry experience during school or after graduation. Indeed, I learned a lot from my summer internship at Amazon as a software engineer. In order to continue to work legally in the industry, OPT extension is extremely important to me and other STEM students. OPT extension gives us the chance to become involved in expanded post-graduate opportunities in the United States. In the meantime, from what I observed from the internship, STEM students has become the crucial contributing forces to US tech companies. Without OPT extension rule, it is obvious that US high-tech companies will lose lots of talented STEM students and therefore negatively strike U.S. economy.

Just like many other international students who decide to leave their home countries and come to study in the U.S., I am attracted by the valuable opportunity of career development and industry experience that are strongly supported by and tied to OPT rules. When I come back to my home country with the knowledge learned in the industry, I will be competitive in the job markets. As you can see, this new OPT rule can not only contribute to U.S. economy by bringing and allowing talented STEM students to work in U.S. tech companies but also benefit STEM students themselves when they come back to work in their home countries.
