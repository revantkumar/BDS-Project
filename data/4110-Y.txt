I support this great rule and anticipate this to be a power boost in the STEM areas. 

First and foremost, it again demonstrates to the entire world the great American spirits of freedom and equality, which have been proved to be the most important factors that makes this country a superpower. Americans can't loose this by narrowing eyes to less competitive jobs. 

Also, it is the open and free competition that continuously provides America the best and vigorous talents from the all over the world. Expanding OPT means to avoid losing more and more young and smart people who are capable of making native Americans more excellent and this country more powerful. 

Besides, the essence of STEM fields is creativity, and the best creation cannot be found if they stop halfway and yield their future to identity restrictions.

More practical, US education will therefore attract more brilliant international students and have more great cooperation. US economy will benefit from the resulting increased multicultural and multi-perspective STEM power, and in turn provides more jobs.

I believe Americans have a broad vision to the upcoming benefits that will boost the energy supply for this superpower.
