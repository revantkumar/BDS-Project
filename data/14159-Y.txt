I strongly support this regulation as we are legally working and contributing to the US economy. 
We get to learn a lot while working as most of the software company HQs are in US and we can work on cutting edge technologies.
Initial 12 month OPT period allows us to understand the basics of the product, while being able to work for 24 more months can allow us to learn further detailed information about our product. 
We also as international students have taken pretty expensive student loans so that we could study here in the US and it would be difficult for us to repay it back, if we lose our job here. Also it would be unfair, as we wouldn't have come here in the first place, if we knew, we couldn't work and get enough experience or pay back our loans.
We have been hired by the companies on MERIT and contribute a lot to the local economy directly and indirectly and support indirect local jobs and businesses.
Since there is already a quota on H1Bs even for students who have US degrees, it is anyways difficult for us to get through the H1b lottery even with a Master's degree. This OPT STEM extension allows us to get at-least one more chance at the H1B lottery, without having to leave the US.
Lastly, this country was built by immigrants and is great because of the hard work of those immigrants as it attracts the best talent around the globe and should not be asking the educated and skilled people to leave.
Thus I strongly support this regulation.
