As long as this is all regulated, I don't see why this would be a bad proposition. The improving and expanding of training opportunities for international students in STEM will make the U.S an even more competitive place to attract the good talent from all over the world. We want the best of the best, so we need to implement ways in which we can bring those great minds over here. I think that just one year of training or OPT is too little to gain the necessary experience and, also, to be seen as a competitive candidate if they return to their home countries. Three years is much better, keeping in mind that the longer you work for an American company, the better their salaries will be. They're not immigrants nor illegals nor undocumented. They're our guests, and I think we need to treat them well and give them what they came here to get: the best education in the world.
