Zhuoran Zhang I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international mechanical engineering master student from China. Two years ago, I had multiple choices of pursuing my master's degree in U.S., Canada, UK, and Australia before. One of the several most significant reasons why I chose to come here was because I was firmly believed that no countries other than the U.S. could provide me with the best industry training opportunities during school and/or after graduation. Now given that the new OPT extension rule has been proposed, it is foreseeable that, if successfully passed, it will attract millions more international talents in the field of STEM to select the U.S. as their choice of better education in the near future. If unsuccessful, this would no doubt be a major devastating news that would strike the confidence and hope of future international STEM talents who are making choices of which country to go to. Without this OPT extension rule, I don't know how the U.S. would stand in attracting tens of thousands of foreign STEM talents every year to provide them with better education and occupation preparation as well as benefiting from their contributions to this country's economy and development. Not to mention the huge impact on the existing F1 OPT program in which student trainees, who have been so beneficial to the revitalization of the US economy, have nothing to do but to leave the country with tears and sense of unfairness. Companies like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, and millions more would suffer a lot.
