I believe this should not just be limited to STEM majors. Plenty of organizations (including mine) require "globally minded" business professionals which do not fall under STEM (Undergraduate Business Majors, MBA's, etc). This type of mindset and exposure amongst future leaders is hard to find in the domestic talent pool.
