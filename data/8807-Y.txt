As a 4 year university degree in electrical engineering, almost 5 years in the US military, 25+ years working in the industry I have seen a tremendous disparity, disappointment in the idea of "The American Dream"

Being unemployed or underemployed for at least a 1/3 of my working career due to having to train a foreigner on US soil to attempt to do my job more than a few times is quite disheartening - only to be lied to usually with the line "hey this will create more & better jobs for all of you), only to be standing in the unemployment line the next day

I have never been arrested, never been convicted of a crime, I speak 3 other languages (Mandarin, German & Arabic) other than English, I don't drink, smoke, party, I am a workaholic, strong work ethic, etc...

But what does corporate America do, they through people like me, Joe public under the bus so they can claim they are more competitive, they wine & dine the politicians American citizens voted into office only to be stabbed in the back
