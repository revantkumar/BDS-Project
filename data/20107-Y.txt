I strongly support the proposal for several reasons listed below:
1. Let's face the fact-- international scholars and students composes a huge part of the science academic world in US; without the stem extension, fewer talented people will come to US to seek education and more will leave after they finish their education. Science and innovation is one of the top reasons that make US the #1 country in the world. STEM extension will definitely help to keep it this way. 
2. Diversity and competition are what keeps this country competitive in all aspects. We want to best people to do the best in their jobs and together make this the best country-- why do we want to push them to our competitors after we train them to become the best?
