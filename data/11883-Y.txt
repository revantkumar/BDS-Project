Many engineers working in IT, finance, math, biology, chemical or any other fields are F1 visa holders, or begin at F1 visa holders. In the history, F1 visa holders made great contributions on US, and it will also continue only if they can have a legal identity to stay here.

Without Stem Extension, hundreds of thousands of F1 students will leave US because they don't have enough time to get a H1B visa. There will be many advanced engineers disappearing from America.
