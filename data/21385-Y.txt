I strongly support this rule for the following two reasons:

1. If this rule be approved, American educational institutions and companies can select the best students in the world rather than the best students in America. There is no double that it will benefit these institutions. Now there are so many foreign people in these institutions. If these people could not allow to work in America when they graduated, they could not have the chance to contribute to this country. 

2. OPT extension is for the international students with STEM degree because there are not enough American students majored in these field. As we know, the companies need to spend more money to employ international graduated students. If American graduated students can meet the companies' requirement, they can be employed at the top of the priority list. Only those places where American graduated students do not want to go or do not able to reach can international graduated students have some choices to go. So the relationship between American graduated students and international graduated students is not competition but complementation.
