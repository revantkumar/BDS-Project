I believe that this new rule of the OPT extension for STEM students is very considerate. In particular, not only international students will benefit from the opportunity to stay in the US and gain experience here, but the rule is also good for American economic by letting the graduates to add value in high tech companies as well as increase consumption. Besides, many of these students have got scholarship which is actually an investment made by the US. Thus, it's smart to keep the students and let them make a difference.
