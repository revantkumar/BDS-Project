As an international student here, I just got my master degree and started my career in NJ. OPT and its extension is very vital for me, since I need it to get legal right working here. Since I just joined this company, most of companies would like new employees can work for them for couple of years, because the first half year is like they train employees, like investing on employees. After that, employees skills sharpened then employees can benefit the companies. 

If we do not have the OPT extension, lots of companies in United States who hired international students would suffered heavy loss on both expertise and technology. If international student do not have OPT extension, they have to go back after one year, under this situation, maybe many of us just start making benefits for our company but we have to leave now. 

So I hope government need to think about this issue very carefully. It's not just for international students but also for American companies and future! !
