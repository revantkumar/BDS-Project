I support the proposal of extending the OPT STEM program to 24 months. US Universities attract great talents from all over the world and make huge expenses to hone them in sharp minds. Once such talented group of people are ready, such a program will allow them to join the workforce and contribute back to the US Economy. Diversity in workforce due to people from different nationalities has certainly helped the technological advancement in the US for the benefit of society.
