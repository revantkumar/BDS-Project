Elizabeth Snoke It is time to stop the influx of immigrants to the USA. We have too many American citizens looking for work and can't find a job
because of all the immigrants. It is also time to send all the iillegal immigrants back where they came from and stop any others 
from entering the USA. It is past time to take back America for the American people.
