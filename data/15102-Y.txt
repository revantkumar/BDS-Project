24 months STEM OPT Extension can definitively help US economics and our technology innovations. I am working for one of the largest American IT firms. Just in my team, there are several international colleagues under OPT. If the 24 months STEM OPT Extension cannot pass, they all might go back to their countries and leave the company in the next year. We have to start looking for other members and train them from the beginnings, which not only costs my team lots of money but also delays my team's projects. Loss of these talents will be disaster and harms a lot financially for my team and the company. We want these smart IT talents with advanced skills to work in my team. I would be happy to see the pass of the law.
