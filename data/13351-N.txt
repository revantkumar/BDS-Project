It seems as OUR government under this administration is more focused on voting and other countries than the American people anymore. Shortage of employees is a very illegitimate excuse for this action. WHY not improve our education system, work on jobs available, and see more to the American people ( who pay your wages ) than importing foreigners? To take money from our systems, put our people out of work for the hidden reasons we all see is not improving our country, will not advance the Liberal party since ALL races are beginning to see the damage from that, and is destroying what WAS a Democratic party. 
Homeland Security Dept, Justice Dept and etc has lost their prestige with the American people by going around American systems, the Constitution and American laws.
My comment mainly is - How about return to rule of law and common sense. WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR A CHANGE. THAT'S what you were hired to do. This PROVES the fact of government OUT OF CONTROL when you go AGAINST the American people and their children. When these companies require our people to train them when they come THEY ARE NOT MORE EDUCATED. Also WHY has companies decided NOT to train OUR OWN SMART PEOPLE AND allowed to do that - when it costs OUR country so much in the long run? ???????????????????????????????? IS government now BUYING CONTROL of employers and their blindly going????
