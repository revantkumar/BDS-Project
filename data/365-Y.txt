I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Competition does not have to be a bad thing. As a STEM-major student from China, I used to work in a company which promotes sino-america relationships and facilitate events to promote cultural communications between the two countries. They NEED employees who can understand Chinese culture as well as American cultures. International students are their best choices. 

Diversity is good for the U.S. Especially, keep the top students in the U.S. will definitely benefit this country. I know a lot of great brilliant people who came here as a international student in the first place, they want to stay in this country and further their research/career, but they have to leave just because they didn't won the H1B visa, which is ridiculous. If they stay, they would make a great contribution for this country.
