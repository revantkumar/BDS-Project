This policy is absolutely doing good to the entire economy of United States. 

Firstly, foreign students pay a huge amount of tuition to those institutions in our country. And as far as I know, the reason for most of them choose United States to pursue their degrees is that they can gain working experience in America after graduation, using OPT. Thus, without the opt extension, less foreign students will be attracted to universities in United States, and the educational institutional will lose a large amount of money which could be spent on their academic studies.

Secondly, there are many talented people among these STEM students. If they can work for the companies in our country, they will bring countless new ideas to our tech area. We all know that those tech companies are pushing forward the entire economy of our country. Without these STEM workers, they will lack energy.

Finally, America is a country with diversity. We gathered smart people from all over the world to make this country better. Without diversity, America is nothing. It is diversity that makes our country that colorful and energetic.
