I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The extension would enable more global talents to make contribution to the U.S. industries. And the U.S should keep attracting the smartest people in the world. The U.S. would be less attractive without this extension, which could mean a great loss of talented minds.

2. Without the extension, a lot of recent foreign graduates working at the U.S. companies will be forced to pack their stuff and return to their countries, which would be a huge disaster for many domestic companies. Furthermore, it would also cause big problems for these foreign families living in states because they lose their income source.
