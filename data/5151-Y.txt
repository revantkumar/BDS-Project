I strongly SUPPORT the proposal, for the benefits of both citizens and non-citizens that the OPT policy helps create more jobs and continue to make the U.S. the most powerful nation in the world. 

Just to take Elon Musk for example, we all know he was from South Africa and studied in a U.S. college. He later founded or co-founded cutting edge tech firms like Tesla, SpaceX and Solarcity. These companies continue to create numerous jobs and help the U.S. lead the world in creativity and technology. 

Long story short, United States of America is built by immigrants. Lets keep the ball rolling.
