This is absolutely outrageous and ridiculous what the DHS is trying to do in this nation! By allowing the Optional Practical Training Program to be extended from 1 year to 3 years is equivalent to corporate welfare! It allows these employers to pay lower wages and avoid paying their fair share of the payroll taxes, lining the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers! THIS MUST STOP RIGHT NOW!!!!! This is an obvious way to bring this nation down, and there are plenty of people who see through this evil agenda and want it stopped.....immediately!!!!
