I just had an interview in Genentech in San Fransisco. There are a lot of Chinese people as well as people from Japan, Hungry etc. What I saw and felt is a big family with great diversity.
Those "foreign" people I talked to are very talented. Yes, I agree that without the extention of OPT there will be more jobs to American people, but with the cost of a lot talented foreign people forced to leave the United States and go back to their own country. I don't think this is what USA wants. In my memory USA is famous for her diversity and this is a big reason lots of foreign people want to stay. I don't think it's a wise decision to drive those good people home instead of letting them contribute to American.
