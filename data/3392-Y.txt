This proposal extends the OPT for STEM students who are employed to 24 months. I think it is a great idea. The reasons are as follows:
1. Those who are employed may not be able to get H1B visa or permanent residence within one year (i.e. the regular OPT). This means they have to go back to their own countries. Who suffers? These students, of course, but more importantly, those employers. Those US companies have trained this student for one year and he or she is just ready to contribute to this employer. Now Those US companies will have to spend more money to re-hire some other people, who may not be qualified. This will definitely hurt US markets and overall economy.

2. These students all have advanced degrees in science and engineering. They are outstanding. They may be next Noble prize winner, next Steve Jobs, next political leader. United States are built on immigrants. Why you have to deport them when they are employed and pursuing the American dream? The extension of 24 more months will lay the foundation for their dreams.

3. Those students who have to leave will contribute to the technology development and economy of countries, such as China and India. This is not a good news for US. For those PhD students, US has spent a tremendous amount of money to support those projects that those students have participated in. Now, US government frees these Dr.s back to their own countries and innovate and compete with US. Oh, this is really pathetic even, when you think of this fierce global competition. 

Therefore, I think this extension will not only help those students, but more importantly, help US to grasp its own future in hand. I strongly support this new policy. 

Thanks!
