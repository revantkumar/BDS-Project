Tianyi Mao I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension proposal. Diversity pool of potential workers is necessary for the growth of the companies and business. There are ridiculous ideas that the program encourages employers to hire foreign students because they pay less in such way. The fact is, most of the students who just graduated from the campus, whether US citizens or foreigners, are very likely to be new to the industry. They work as internship/training at the beginning of their career. They are paid less because they are interns, regardless to their nationality. Also, the E-verify mechanism prevents "unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status". The job market is fair play. The final result is that the companies work with the best employees, which promotes the development of US industry.
