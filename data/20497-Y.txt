Big thumb up for the proposal rule. The hard work by foreign employees and students have brought prosperity to the United States which leads to tons of new job openings for the people. Their education and professional practice do not only benefit the company and industry they work for, the country (the US), but also those who strongly disapprove the proposal. Note for the immigrant or foreign haters: even if you were able kick everyone that's not American out of the country, high chance that lots of you still wouldn't be qualified for the jobs they worked on, and you could practically bring down the country by kicking people out.
