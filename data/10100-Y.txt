I completely support this policy! I'm a 5th year Ph.D. student with physics background. During the Ph.D. program I did a lot of work for our projects supported by NSF. We published several papers on Nature Materials, PRL, etc. However, if we cannot have enough time during the OPT we can only leave US without any more contribution to either academia or industry!! I hope every one should have the opportunity to pursue their dreams in United States. God bless us!!!
