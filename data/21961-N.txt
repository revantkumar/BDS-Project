It is ridiculous to think that we need more cheap foreign labor. My own sons find it hard to get a decent paying job as it is. Now asking them to compete with those that will enable tax breaks for employers and lower wages because of their status and my Sons will never have a good job. Unfortunately, i am not able to vote our current POTUS out of office. But, i can and wiil vote agains any of my representatives that do not try to block this. At the rate of increase we are currently on, Americans will find it hard to even work "fast food" jobs at minimum wage.
