Kyle Liang I am totally supporting this new regulation. It will attract more international students coming to US with their property and knowledge.

First, as far as we known, they contribute a lot financial income of the US universities (see attachment) which in turn creating a lot of job opportunities. Many American schools will struggle with their financial situation if they lost that income from international students. Cutting university jobs may not be the only inevitable thing happened but also lowering teaching quality if the international students lost their interest in US.

Besides, the international students are creating huge values to and playing import roles in the US economy. With their knowledge, they work very hard for this nation. The US companies hired them as top tier workers in their tech departments as supporting their daily operations. 

Finally, it has very few evidence supporting many criticisms accusing that the international students took away the jobs with comparing between the trends of the job unemployment rate and the international students number.
