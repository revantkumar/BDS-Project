First of all, I definitely support the rules. I have read through many of the negative comments and found most of them are nonsense, some of which sound ridiculous.

1. "We have too many STEM american students are out of jobs". Accodring to a recent report from CNN (http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/06/news/economy/jobs-report-october/) the US unemployment rate is as low as 5% right now, the lowest since 2008. Therefore this claim ( and it seems that people just copy it from other places and used it here without even thinking about it) is not even true in the first place. 

2. Even if the unemployment rate is somewhat high. I am sure most of people out of jobs are non-tech persons, because as a tech person myself, I know that in the recent years, tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. are hiring more and more people. That said, even if international students are forced to leave USA because of this absurd reason, these tech companies will not hire someone from the unemployed group who is not qualified at all.

3. "This new rule will give companies incentives to hire cheaper foreign worker, instead of americans". This is even more meaningless. Students who benefit from OPT are all from good universities, most of whom have advanced degrees like masters or PhDs. If they are hired, they will be hired by big tech companies. They will earn much more than american's average salary. A PhD at Google can earn as much as $200,000 yearly, a master can earn $150,000. 

4. If this new rule couldn't be issued due to those absurd negative comments. Most of the tech companies will lose thousands and thousands of talented workers by this coming February. You have to admit today's USA economy depends highly on these tech companies. Unless US government is willing to see another major economical crisis in the near future, I don't think they will not allow this new rule to be issued.
