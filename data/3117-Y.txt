I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. STEM is a very specified area that need more talent international students contribute to their work hard, and they need more time to show their talent during working.

2. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

3. Diversity is very important for the U.S. So in STEM, everyone has opportunities show their hard work . There are so many excellent scientists and Nobel Prize winners in STEM are from all over the world. Without enough time and patience, they can not contribute so much to the world.
