I support the 24-month OPT extension. I currently work in a high tech company in northern Virginia. Many of my coworkers are immigrants with advanced degrees. Personally, I enjoy working with them because they are hardworking and they are really dedicated. Some of them are eccentric but very friendly and humble. I learn from them everyday. I know that most of them were the best students before they came to the US. When they came here, we already spent quite a lot of resources training them to become experts in so many different fields. Why letting them go back if we have already spent so much on training them and we already know they are good? Our policy should encourage the well-trained people to stay instead of driving them away. Look at the technologies we built up among the years. To be honest, can we really do that without those people? Can you image Silicon Valley without high-tech immigrants? They came from good fundamentals and they are wiling to contribute. We should keep the guidelines and continue to build more together with them.
