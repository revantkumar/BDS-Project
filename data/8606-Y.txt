Rambabu Attili I support the new STEM OPT Extension rule. Not passing this rule will impact students currently present in US. They came thinking of the career and growth opportunities.

The main reason this program even exists is because there are not enough US citizens in STEM fields. Government should take some action to make US students take up STEM fields. Also most of the US students quit studies after under-graduate study unlike their foreign counter parts. Such a program is necessary to fill the demand for stem workers till then.

Some people are complaining that OPT program is misused by companies to reduce the wages. In fact, the opposite is true. Average income of a STEM worker is much higher than national average. For some fields like IT, it is almost two to three times the national average. 

International students bring in billions of dollars for their education every year. Not having enough opportunities in US will impact this as future students will prefer to go to countries like Canada, Australia etc. This is another form of brain drain.

Getting a job as an international student is not easy. Many positions require a permanent resident or US citizen. 

Many people are complaining that US citizens lost thousands of jobs because of this program. I don't agree with that. There is no fixed number of jobs. It's based on the economy. And a job taken by international student should not be considered as a job lost for US citizen.
