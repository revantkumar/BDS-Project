I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Many of the F-1 students are among the top students from each universities. They possess the fresh knowledge to contribute to the U.S. society and should be given the chance. It takes some time before they can get used to the working environment and being fully equipped with the working capacity, a OPT extension is absolutely helpful. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many of the great people that have made great contribution to U.S. society are from other counties. The culture diversity and inclusiveness are one of the reasons that make U.S. a great country.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Most of the F-1 students are there to fill in the positions that are lack of domestic people. Even when competition exist, I see a lot of cases is Americans and International colleges working together, learning from each other and make better case.
