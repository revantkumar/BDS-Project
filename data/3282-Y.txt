Strongly support this proposal. As what I've seen the STEM graduates in the US technology companies are working very hard and have contributed enormously and this is how this country keeps competitive and creative in the world. Also since they have paid taxes to this country, I would say we are all beneficiaries from the STEM OPT extension.
