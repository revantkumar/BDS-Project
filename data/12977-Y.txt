I support this rule for two reasons.
1. As the biggest immigrant country in the world, the US, benefit from immigrant people a lot. People who work in STEM, 
are almost high-qualified people whom are desired not only in the US but also in some rapidly develping country such as China, 
India and the Russia Federation. Some pioneering works from the STEM guys are really successful. If the OPT extention is
canceled, then huge amount of STEM people will have to go to other country and the better qualified immigrants will be lost. 
However, other immigrants taking up of jobs in the US are still here however you like them. What the country lose is the most 
required people among them. Personally, I think this will bring great loss to the US.
2. From comments, I found that Americans complain about fewer job opportunities are given to them. As far as I am concerned, 
small companies are not always friendly to international students because they have to help them get H1B which will waste 
managers a lot of time. But big companies such as Google, Apple, who hire qualified people no matter you are American citizen
or not, Being able to work well is the first priority. International students really work hard to get those opportunities. Thus, I think 
people should focus on the competence they have but not always find some protection from federal, this, should give a positive
circulation for both American people and international student to promote their skills to find jobs, and for a company to progress.
