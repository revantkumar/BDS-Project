Strongly support 24-month extension of STEM OPT Extension! It will allow international students to gain enough training before going back to their home country. Meanwhile it will allow them to enter the lottery of H1b multiple times to obtain long-term working visa. It will also improve the quality of workforce. Right now it is unfair for those skilled workers who cannot get H1b at the first attempt and leave the country due to visa issues.
