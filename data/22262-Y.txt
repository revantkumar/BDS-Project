I'm definitely back up for this proposal which is good for US no matter in the long term or short term.

1. Most of international students especially stem major students came to US for their outstanding performance. In other words, US government educated these talents with its own funding, great education resources. Now, international students with advanced skills and knowledge want to stay and contribute to US but are not allowed. It does not make sense for US. You invest a lot of money but don't want return.

2. US is the greatest country in the world. It was build up by immigrants. At the very beginning, none of them are originally from US. They were from everywhere. Diversity is the secret why US can outperform the other countries. Recall from WWIIUS diversity attracted most of scientists in the world to come and serve for US. Why are now US government going to abandon its biggest advantages rather than keeping it? Every resident of US should be proud of US diversity not shame on it. KEEP US DIVERSIFIED!

3. If US government decide to let all international students get out of the states once they graduate, will US economy continue to grow and every one is happy? Definitely NOT! All positions currently filled by international students still can't find appropriate US candidates. What will companies respond in such situation? They will transfer job opportunities out where have lower salary cost and better skilled candidates. Eventually, US will lose international competition. 

Actually, international students compete with other US residence sitting on worse situation and getting lower compensation than market level but they provide a more healthy US economy. They want to be part of the states not to combat with anybody. If US government drive them away rather than welcome them, US will lose the opportunity to win the competition in the 21st century.
