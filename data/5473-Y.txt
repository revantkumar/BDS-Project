Concerned Citizen What the hell are you thinking? Are you deliberately attempting to undermine our nation? We are already being overwhelmed with non English speaking, low skill workers, and you want to allow more? Obviously, someone is filling their pockets at the expense of people in our country who desperately need jobs! Enough! We have an Administration that has already sold our our Nation to satisfy his liberal/progressive agenda! With borders that remain unsecured our very sovereignty is at risk! Again, enough! First we faced the obscenity called the "Dream Act" that disadvantaged our American youth by rewarding criminal, illegal aliens, and now this! Enough!
