I am an international student and now works in a hardware company. If my company plans to provide a new chip to market. Usually it takes nearly two years to get a test chip and one year to make final chip for production. We need almost three years to send a new chip to market for everyone. With the new extension, at least I can finish this program with my group before I leave thus the schedule will not be affected. I have to say I am only one example and similar things happen in most of the tech companies. you can tell the effect on those tech industries. Remember these are all US companies. I don't care where I will live in the future, but I want to get my program done. it is my first program in my career life.
