I am FOR the EXPANDING TRAINING OPPORTUNITY for STEM students.
STEM are four areas which are very very very important for every country. Most students doing STEM are really great property for the US. Giving them support is good for America's development about these four areas. We all know US students are more good at arts, then why not combine other people's advantages? By the way, do not forget US is a country developed by immigration, and that's another reason for US's diversity.
