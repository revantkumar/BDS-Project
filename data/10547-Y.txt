I strongly SUOOURT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Look at those famous and important people in United State, quite a few of them were international students before, but is making such a big change in United State. Sundar Pichai, who is currently CEO of google Inc. He completed his master degree in Stanford University, of course, as an international students. This amazing young man is leading the world to a new era, where new information technology, medical innovation, capital operation will happen in an extremely efficient way and it will help American and people all of the world enjoy more healthy, more developed life. I work in a very quantitative company, specializing derivative pricing. Most of quants, who can be regarded as smartest people in Wall Street, are from Russia and China. Without them, the core part of this kind of companies will crash.

2. Competition does exist, but it's not bad for United States. International students are those smart and hardworking students in their own county. After demanding administration, they come to United States. At least, from my personal perspective, only 1/6 of students in my college class can be elected to universities in United States. Thus, most of us are good students. We come here to study and encourage and help American students to work hard. The professors in the university really like us, not only because we are smart, but also because we can make contributions.
