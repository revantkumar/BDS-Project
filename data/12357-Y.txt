As an F-1 International student in U.S, I believed that the extending of OPT is very important and necessary for us. I am not sure about the impact to American's economy by this action, but I have to say it's becoming more and more difficult us to get an H-1B in every year's draft even for students who hold STEM degree.

If we can get the OPT extended, we will have one more year and one more chance for the draft. Otherwise, even a talent international student graduate with a high grade is accepted by a prospective company, they might need to leave U.S. as long as no one ensure their H-1B visa. In this case, U.S. industry will lost of talents, which will impact the construction of United States potentially.

I am a hard working guy with high GPA. But I am still worrying that if the company which I am hired for in the future will help me to get the H-1B visa or not because there's a lots of documents and procedures to do. I am worrying that some of the company will put high pressure on me while they agree to apply H-1B for me. Changing company/get temperamentally underemployed are pretty inconvenient for H-1B applicants. Thus, we might need to tolerate some unfair rule. 

"All men are created equal". Thus, all graduate in U.S. should be promised to have equal right in job opportunity.

Thanks.
