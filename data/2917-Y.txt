New regulation proposed by DHS is better than the previous STEM extension. Addition of use of previous STEM degree for 24 months extension is logical and this amended rule should be in effect. This is most logical too, because if you have earned stem degree, then you should be able to use that for extension. Many people like to mix their education with science and business management. Why should someone not be allowed extension if they have engineering degree in undergraduate and did not apply for OPT and continued their study in MBA; if they applied OPT after MBA. 

Also, 24 months extension should help with H1B and gaining valuable knowledge. I support this amended proposed rule by DHS.
