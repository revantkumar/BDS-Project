What do you mean by they are studying and working at American tax payer. That's nonsense. They pay tuition for study, and they pay federal, state tax as employees here. Please do not speak out like a person knowing nothing.

Since day one, led by those national fathers, this country has been always opening the door for elite immigrants to join her, this is how this country stays strong.

It is so obvious that if Americans have so much more advantages to find a job when comparing to international employees, as long as they are equipped with the skills needed. If you can't find a job, ask yourself: are you really good at it, are you qualified? Do not just blame international students, they have rights to work here, they also should be provided opportunities to be a part of this country. For those who are current Americans, they were immigrants and just landed on this country earlier than international students. But again, this is a country of immigrants and all legal immigrants should be welcomed.
