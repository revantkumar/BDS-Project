Robin Hvidston This program should be abolished! We have 90 million Americans looking for a job and NO foreign workers should take our Americans' jobs. I know high tech Americans OUT OF WORK! Programs to train, help and get AMERICAN these jobs should be the goal NOT the use our TAX DOLLARS to facilitate foreign workers!!!!
