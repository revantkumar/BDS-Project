I strongly support the new extension rule. As an international student, we all acknowledge that if we want to extend our OPT program, we have to have an e-verified employer. DHS already initiate a e-verified program, to prevent unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. This program greatly protect international students and other vulnerable groupspreventing them been treated unfairly in the job, which means international students get paid as the same with US citizens and have the same medical care. So such sayings that jobs have been taken away by international students is unjustified ! OPT extension will only apply to e-verified company, and e-verify ensure that everyone will be treated consistent, non-discriminatory when related pursuing a job and payment, and certainly not discrimination locals. Also on the opt students pay is too low, resulting in employer are more willing to hire international students . As saying internship, interns' payment are always lower than normal regular employees pay, and not just opt students pay low, even if you are a citizen. The key to this thing is, "the intern's wages lower than the full-time employees, leading companies are willing to hire interns rather than full-time employees", if US citizen are dissatisfied, they can go for greater intern wages and benefits, and not just for the opt extension, because intern are only a small subset of the opt extension.
