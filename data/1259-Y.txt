It's really an extremely excellent proposal that should be approved without any hesitation. In other word, I will completely support this proposal with no reservation.

I think all of us know that foreigners who work in STEM fields make a huge contribution to US economy, which means without these elite people, there will be a tremendous impact on US IT industry and even US economy. After 2008 economy crisis, it's not easy for US to recover the economy. So if US lose these excellent people, there definitely will be a huge loss for US.

In addition, what attract so many students to go America to study is the high-quality education as well as the work VISA situation. Students can use OPT to work in US without the work VISA, which surely an advantage over England and Australia. So if this proposal can be approved, I believe there will be much more students to go to America for further study.

Therefore, I totally support this proposal and I hope it can be approved in the future.
