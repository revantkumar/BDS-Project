I support this extension. After reading most of the negative comments here, I think it is insane to ban the OPT just because some Americans afraid for competition from these international students. If so, why shall we develop so many robot technologies, which can replace a lot of labor too. If we really stop the extension just to avoid competition then we should expel all these international students and workers, and just shut down US immigration and make US isolate from others, in which we will feel safer as non one will compete for the job opportunity at all.
