I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Firstly, if the government does not encourage the students who got a degree to stay in the country, all the investment of financing and social services they consumed during their study go in vain. It's a big loss to the country

Secondly, diversity is very important for the U.S and this is exactly one of the most important reason why the States are what they are today.

Last but not the least, competition may exist, but is not necessarily a bad thing. Most of the positions taken by international students cannot be filled by citizens otherwise. It's not that those international students took the positions for much lower wages.
