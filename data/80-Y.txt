I understand the circumstances that many native STEM employers and potential STEM employers are concerned with the possibility that the foreign students will make them less competitive in the job market. However, in the longer time, forcing cost-efficient foreign workers going back to their own countries will decrease the competence of United States and its business giants. So it's a trade off between personal and national benefits. I don't much care about the result anyway, and I believe people who has a irreplaceable abilities (I don't mean myself)will acquire great job opportunities in any condition.
