Nowadays, more and more international graduates with advanced degrees (i.e. Master, PhD) from top US universities are forced to go back their own country, although most of them are willing to contribute to US as great engineers and scientists.

Therefore, it is definitely a big loss to US, because the export of techniques and knowledge to other countries like this will make our opponents stronger and make US less competitive.

I strongly support the extension of the OPT.
