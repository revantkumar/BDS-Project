Technically speaking, extending the OPT plan is a win-win policy. For America for example, many IT companies would benefit from getting bigger chance of holding more qualified computer and electric engineers out of international students pool. This a fairly large group that if we do a survey on the nationality statistics of graduate students from all sorts of good engineer graduate schools in America, we would found most of the masters, PhDs and even post-docs are international students, who may need such legal status to help them stabilize their career in America after their school time, especially in computer science and electrics major. And also seen from currently many giant companies in the industry field, lots of senior engineers hold the same background, except that they might long survived from this status issue, but where they started, at least are the same thing. And the meaning of this is that these people form part of the major development force and is supporting these American companies staying the leading position in the field. What an advantage that many other countries want and this policy of expanding the OPT only helps to strengthen the situation. It's a win-win policy because on the other side, those who benefit from this policy would definitely have bigger chance expand their career in America or many even stay longer. Many people think that's bad? Actually, even for the native people, it's not bad but good for the long run. Why? Think about this, those whoever qualify with the policy must have a STEM degree and a promising career, meaning they are successful compared with the same age fellows. How can having successful people around be bad? Not only will they contribute more to the economy but also, because of human's social nature, they can influence others, and even maybe better model for the generations to come...
It can't be bad and America definitely will gain more from this policy!
