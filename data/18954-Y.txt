I support the opt-extension and I think it would be in the best interest of our nation.

If there is no opt-extension, many overseas students won't come to U.S. to study because there is no longer good opportunity for them to get work experience in the U.S., they may select U.K. or Australia as their target country for studying abroad, which may be a disaster for the higher educational system in the U.S.. 

If you have been to any neighborhood near colleges, you probably noticed that many of the student there are international students, they are the source income of the local restaurants, pharmacy shop and grocery stores. If they disappear, these restaurants and shops will suffer from significant customer loss and may fire many employees, which is the case that we don't want to see.

Thus, OPT-Extention will definitely be in the best interest of our nation.
