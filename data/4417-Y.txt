I don't expect US citizens to know this, but the truth is we are often turned down as soon as the recruiters found out our status. Most of the times, we don't even get an interview. Even with the OPT program running, only very few companies are willing to offer opportunities to foreign students. Some argue that international student work as cheap labors which companies like to use. However it takes time to adjust to the working environment and routine, and why would companies prefer to invest time and resources on someone who will leave soon if that person is not more competent, qualified for the job? I really don't think companies would lay off American workers, hire "cheap labors" and not think about the turnover cost. 
America is often portrayed as the land of opportunity and this is exactly why America is able to attract talents from all over the world. 
I support this proposal because it would give international students opportunities to experience US work environment and contribute their knowledge and expertise. 
I support this proposal because it would encourage foreign students to come to US, which creates diversity, an important value in the American culture. 
I support this proposal because a little bit of competition is a actually a good thing. It motivates people(both US citizens and international students) to be better.
