SUPPORT this Extension without any hesitation.

I live in New York now and used to live in London and I found many things in common between the two metropolis. The most impressing feature of the two is that those with great ideas or skills will always find a place and contribute to the city, the people and the pulse.

I used to dislike the City for the sheer contrast between its messiness and the beauty of other cities in the US, and how intolerable people can be in the NYC for they themselves could probably suffering from their own trouble. But most importantly people here are willing to embrace people from different ethnic background and like the city for its diversity. 

So I was kind of shocked to see so many vitriolic comments here. Discrimination is seriously abhorred in the field of academia, but now you are talking about "you guys are no good only because you are foreigners." How about us tracing back to most americans' great-great-grandparents, or just great-grandparents for God's sake, to see if you should be defined as a Immigrant's descendent?

And please face the truth instead of just saying "foreigners are treated better than the citizens". Think twice before you reach the conclusion that a company is more inclined to hire a foreinger. They came with worse language skills and different cultural background, but if you are still losing the game, shouldn't you be working harder?

Just admit it. we are human beings instead of just formulas, and hiring decisions are made based on his entire skill set, his creativity and attitude towards life and work e.t.c. REGARDLESS OF HIS ETHNIC GROUP OR BACKGROUND.
