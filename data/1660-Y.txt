I support the OPT extension, given the following reasons:

It will help students gain the working experience and establish connections with the people they work with. When they get back to their home country, they have a better chance of getting a better job with the working experience they gained.

Moreover, they can use the connection they built with American company and the company in their home country to establish partnership and work together to expand the market, it's is good for both parties in creating more job opportunities in both countries.

If there's no work experience in America, it is not likely to happen.
