I support this expansion for several causes:
1. It will create a more diverse, more opportunistic and more creative environment for brilliant minds from all over the world. 
2. It will make foreign people truly believe that America is a country that treats men and women with respect. 
3. It will expand the economy as time passes-not only will the expanding market do good to the immigrants or foreigners, it will also benefit the citizens, as there will be more and more jobs available. 
4. President Obama's, and countless number of congressmen's effort to promote this regulation will not be in vain. 
5. Failure of promoting this regulation will result in brain drain of foreign students-which will be a loss and hinder to the education system.
