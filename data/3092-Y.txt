Thanks for proposing 24 months OPT STEM extension. Considering the requirement of young talent in united states and current broken immigration system It would be great if OPT STEM can be extended to 6 years. This helps students to continue their stay in US for a longer years and contributes more to US economy growth with the experience they gained. Extending OPT STEM to 6 years will help to overcome the H1B lottery system and prevents students going back to home countries.
