I strongly support this rule. It definitely benefits American economy and Job Industry. It is not stealing Jobs from American citizens, companies hire people based on their qualifications and not based on citizenship. If an american is more qualified for the job he would definitely be selected over an unqualified international student. If this rule is not proposed, then the quality reduces as it creates more vacancies and we won't have qualified engineers to fill in the workforce. It is survival of the fittest on a common fair ground ,than just get some quota system and have a free ride with lazy attitude.
