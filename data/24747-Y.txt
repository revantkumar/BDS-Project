OPT program is an efficient way to keep the well-educated students who has already completed US study to contribute to our country. I support the idea of OPT extension. 

Here is an example around me. My coworker Zhao studied engineering in BU and joined our department as a software engineer using his OPT. He did an excellent job and grew to a key person in the team quickly in one year time. He helped the team to grow bigger and started several new projects. The team hired several US citizen new grad students this year. Zhao mentored them and became a leader. However, Zhao failed the H1-b lottery and had to leave US because his OPT ran out last month. It is a big loss for his team, especially the new hires.

We should provide a good opportunity to STEM students like Zhao. They have proved that their contribution can create new positions and benefit our country. We should extend the length of OPT to make sure that they can get an H1-b visa.
