Does education make a person a better person?
If the answer is Yes, then my next question is why not keep those better persons, who our society spends so much to make them grow (even though most of them also pay a lot of money for tuition and living).
The people with graduate program is valuable to the world, also true for USA.
We should do everything we can to keep them and let them work/contribute for America!
STEM OPT extension for 24-month is a good step, even though not enough!
Thumbs up for 24-month STEM OPT extension!
