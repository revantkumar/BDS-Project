Hao Xu I came to USA for further learning is because of the 29 months OPT. If there is no OPT extension, I don't know why we will choose USA not Canada, UK or Australia. I got my master degree here, which cost me 50,000 dollars per year, two years in total, which is a lot of money. Only 12 months OPT time is far from enough. Even now, it is very difficult for us to find a job in USA. If we miss the only one opportunity for applying H1B, we have to go home.

I don't think we take native people's job. There is few Americans in my major. And most of my classmates, we are doing the testing job. It is hard for the company to find the qualified people to fill in the position. Besides, the company should be e-verified, which means it treat everyone equally, no matter what you are from. The people who said it is unfair, are you doubting e-verified policy?

If we only have 12 months OPT time. Fine, the excellent masters and PHDs have to leave USA if they can't get the H1B, which is more than 200,000 people apply 50,000 position.
You know what, the international employees take the majority in most of the high tech companies. If they go, the USA economy and high tech field must be affect a lot.
