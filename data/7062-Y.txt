I STRONGLY support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. OPT is a very good opportunity to fulfill both STEM students and the whole country, even the whole world. As an engineering student, I eagerly want to contribute myself in the United States because in the United States I can be provided best technological ecosystems. Then I can largely explorer my potential in the engineering field and help me devote my effort, in a maximum degree, to the world. And OPT is the crucial path to fulfill it. So I really cherish OPT.

2. On the other hand, annihilating OPT is not a good solution to decrease unemployment rate. For STEM students with higher educations, their job positions are usually concentrated on research and technology; however the people who are unemployed, mostly, can afford fundamental jobs. If there're less STEM employers in the United States, it won't change the big picture so much because there's still a large percent of unemployed people cannot replace the STEM student to work on that positions.

Instead, OPT can stimulate more international students to take higher educations in the United States, which also create more job positions for people who is unemployed. According to reports available through NAFSA (Association of International Educations) it has been estimated that international students and their families have contributed $26.8 Billion to the US economy and created or supported 340,000 jobs during the 2013-2014 academic year.

Please carefully considered my claim.
