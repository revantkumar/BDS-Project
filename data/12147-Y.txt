1. How many of those people are really in STEM field when they claimed that H1B students took over their working opportunities?

2. How many of those people who claimed H1B students took their jobs mostly use computer to chat and Facebook? Do they know who created Facebook and other softwares for your smart phone? STEM people. How many of those people know about programming or algorithm?

3. If American people are proud of the United States as the model of equal opportunity, then it's so ironic that those opposed group are afraid of just competitions. It's like saying that "Hey, look at us, the United States, we are the ideal model of modern democracy, equal opportunity and human rights leader; Wow hey wait, not for you, too bad you are foreigners. So just sit and watch us. We are the best. Just watch."

4. The opposed group is claiming that H1B students will take their jobs away; do they even check how many of STEM jobs that they are really qualified for? They would like those jobs being vacuum rather than someone who's qualified to do it and create revenue for the United States, only because they are foreigners?!

5. If you still want to yell out "USA Number 1" in the future, it's better that somebody is on the advanced STEM jobs; otherwise, you will lose the full confidence to say that really really soon.
