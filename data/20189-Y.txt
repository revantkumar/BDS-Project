We must PASS the OPT extension bill! For the good of the United States!

US has remained the best country in the world for nearly a century. The reason is that she values talented people and accept them from all over the world. US top universities have done a lot of work to admit the best of a generation into US. If there is no OPT extension, nobody will want to study in US anymore. As an international student, I will prefer Europe, Canada, any other country that is more acceptive to me. If US choose to abandon us, US will never be a country that people admire. And I am sure, China and India have enough capacity for these talented people. They will become the new leader in the world, believe it or not. Let the 'well-educated' Americans to fill up this hole, you will find it becomes bigger and bigger.
