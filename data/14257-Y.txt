As a US citizen, I believe there should be common ground as US should retain talented foreign students while preventing abusive use of this program. 
I have the following suggestions for improving OPT program:
1) clear wage requirement for employers to recruit students on OPT, this will help create a fair atmosphere to let foreign students and US workers compete on the same page, that way US workers will not be out-compete simply because of 'cheap foreign stem workers'.
2) OPT program should only be available for students from top 50-100 US universities, the current provision "accredited Universities" is too vague.
