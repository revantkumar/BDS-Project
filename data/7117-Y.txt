I strongly SUPPORT the proposal! The reasons are as follows:

(1) International students learn from US, so they should make contribution.
In STEM departments of most FAMOUS universities (i.e, computer science, electronic engineering etc), half of PhD students are international students even though the universities give a lot of priorities to US citizens to incentivize them to apply this major (but they DON'T want to apply!). Most of these international students are TOTALLY funded (both tuition and stipend) by National Science Foundation, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the like. The government spends so much money on these students to provide FREE!!!! education to them!!!! It's INSANE to send them back immediately after they enjoy the FREE education. These international students should be given longer time to make contribution to this country!!!

(2) This country shouldn't close the door just because people are scared of BENIGN competitions. 
The bar for international students to apply jobs is extremely high. The priorities will always give to US citizens. The international students need to put much much more effort to get jobs. It's not international students bringing the competition to US job markets. The people who cannot find jobs, please blame yourself, nobody can always eat free lunch! 
And also, these international students are not the people who get extremely low salaries and just want to stay in US. The students using STEM OPT-extension are talent people who can always get very high salary everywhere in the world. There is no reason for them to live here poorly! 
NOBODY STEAL JOBS FROM US citizens!! NO UNFAIR competition here!
