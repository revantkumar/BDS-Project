It's INSANE to blame the OPT program for some of the US citizens who cannot get a job.

As you know, only hi-tech companies like Google, Facebook, etc offer jobs for STEM students. Those position requires high proficiency in theories and engineering. But, there do exists native Americans in those companies, which means the companies which recruit foreign students, is still open to native Americans. Therefore, I believe the best companies door is always open for anyone, and that is the reason why those companies become giant in the world.

The reality is that, the people complaining or blaming here, that they cannot get a job because of foreign students, I guess they themselves are not even qualified for the requirements of those big companies. Big companies recruit foreign guys because there are not enough qualified guys among native workers, not because they have bias on foreign students.

In conclusion, the OPT program has nothing to do with those people who cannot find a job. For those who cannot find a job, I suggest U.S. government, create more job opportunities in other fields, and I suggest those folks complaining, please improve yourself. Simply complaining does not get you a job.
