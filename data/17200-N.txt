I'm against the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. It certainly incentivizes companies to hire these foreign workers rather than US citizen students and graduates that are in many instances currently unemployed. 

Direct evidence of this is not in the 5% falling and manipulated unemployment rate by the Bureau of Labor Statistics but in the far more important labor-force participation rate. This rate for October 2015 is at a 38 year low of just 62.4% of American civilians over the age of 16 either working or looking for work. Approval of the proposal would certainly cause this participation rate to continue declining. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 94,513,000 people (ages 16 and over) were neither employed nor had made specific efforts to find work in the prior four weeks during the month of October, 2015.

We've all read stories of the Disney workers and other companies being laid off and not only being replaced by foreign workers but were required to train their replacements. This along with some of the massive layoffs being announced by large corporations with replacement of these foreign workers at lower wages and without the share of social security taxes will grow exponentially under the new proposed rules. It certainly will not help the $18 Trillion Federal Debt that also continues to grow exponentially. 

Just remember this could be the loss of your job or your kid's or grand-kid's jobs or their ability to secure a job due to expansion under this rule should it take effect.
