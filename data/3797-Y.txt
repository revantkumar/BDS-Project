I strongly support proposal. 

There are so many people claiming that the companies are hiring international students for cheaper salaries.

However, there is no evidence to support this. 

Just take a look at the salaries provided by the companies, who hire a lot of STEM students.

Like google, Facebook, Amazon, etc., normally a Ph.D majoring at STEM could get around 200,000 as a total package per year. 

Do you really think this is a cheap salary?

The real reason that these companies continue to hire international students is that they could not find sufficient employees with such education levels and skills. 

Just do some simple homework before you claim that the foreign labor is cheapter. 

Thanks.
