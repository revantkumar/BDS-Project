"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." The Declaration of Independence

ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ALL MAN HAS THE EQUAL RIGHT TO WORK, no matter he or she is U.S.Citizen, Green card, or F1 students. Job marketing is fair, jobs are filled with people who have the necessary skills. When there is short of Americans to fulfill the job requirement, employers especially high-tech companies may consider to hire F1 students who has the corresponding knowledge and skills. It follows the common sense and economy laws. 

I strongly support the proposing policy for the following reasons.
1.OPT and OPT STEM program are benefiting U.S. economy[1], U.S. technology[2] and U.S. diversity (obviously). As someone may not known, F1 students are also paying tax to federal and states. Tremendous amount of F1 students are working at high-tech companies which make everyones life more convenient and efficient. 
2.OPT and OPT STEM program help US universities to attract the most talent students to US. This makes sure U.S. has enough qualified human resource on STEM related research.

Again, ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, ALL MAN HAS THE EQUAL RIGHT TO WORK.
