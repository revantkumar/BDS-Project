OPT may be the only smart decision of DHS. Many comments concern the jobs are taken by foreigners. Keep in mind that there are not enough us citizens with masters or phd degrees in STEM. If the high tech companies could not hire qualified works here, they will move their positions to India or China. We will lose more jobs here and we will lose the leading position in high tech. Can you image the next Google or Microsoft is from China??? This will destroy the United States.
