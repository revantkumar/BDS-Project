Brian Zhu I would like to support the proposed rule. 

I'm currently working as a Software Developer at AOL. We are working on developing a new tool for one of our existing websites. It is estimated that the project will be done in at least 2 years. The proposed rule guarantee that me and many of my colleagues can stay in the team and finish the project. 

Thank you for proposing this rule!
