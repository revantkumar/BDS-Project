Dear Sir/Mam
Please stop all policies that favor foreign workers over American citizens. I am trained in the areas you mentioned and I have been unable to get a job in my industry. If you bring over millions more foreigners to compete with me, this will make it even more difficult for me.

Sincerely

Mark Kozlauska
