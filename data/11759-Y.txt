US is a country built by immigrants. The immigrant policy will seriously affect the future demography of US. This STEM OPT strongly favors the immigrants that have a US undergraduate/graduate degree in STEM field, which is most needed in US. There is no reason for US to push these immigrants candidates back to the same position as others from different sources. For the sake of US economy, a immigrant policy that favors those who have STEM background that US needs, and presented their qualification to live in US when they study, is fully practical and justifiable.
