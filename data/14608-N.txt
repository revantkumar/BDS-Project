It is WRONG to put other people ahead of Americans. We need the jobs more and it is OUR country!!! Here in West Virginia the war on coal has put tens of thousands out of work and depressed our economy for everyone else. We are struggling to just pay utilities and eat. This is wrong to give anyone outside of our country a job when there are so many here starving and losing all they have. No outsider should have a job over American LEGAL citizens.
