I am writing the comments to support the F1 student extension policy proposal by DHS. It goes without saying that US becomes the most powerful country of the world because of the efforts of high technology and creativity. It is contributed by well educated students. For the human nature, an US native PHD or Master would select an easygoing life to pay back their efforts for academics. The advantages of their languages and cultures fit them into better jobs but leave many spots (which need their expertise) unfilled. Thus, it is new immigrants help fit these positions, which contributes a lot and not even expect a fair pay back. This new OPT extension policy is very important for making these professionals contributing US and needs high priority of notice by US citizens/government, and further approved.
