I am a EE student from China,and I am preparing for my application.The reason why I choose U.S. as my dream country is that I can get trained after graduation,which will make me more competitive when I return to China .If I can't have enough time to work in America ,I might choose another country like Canada (In fact,I am applying to both countries).
