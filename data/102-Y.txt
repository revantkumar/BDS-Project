Improving and expanding the training opportunities for F-1 students is extremely important for both US industry and the foreign students. The tremendous contributions by these highly educated and talented F-1 students have already been widely appreciated by the society, not only in academia, but only in industry. With improved and expanded training opportunities, they can provide even more contributions to the society, and this would also stimulate further knowledge, and culture interaction globally. I sincerely support to improve and expand the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.
