Gerson Martinez Good day to you all,
as one who came into this country in 1972, at the age of 18, with the only dream to join the Army, and having been given the opportunity, and having served 8 years in the military, ( 3 years Army active reserve, 3 years active duty USMC, and 2 more years active reserve USMC) and willing to do it all over again if necessary, I would say, let the people who are willing to give back to this great country, give them the chance to prosper because in the process they in turn will help not only themselves but many more.

Sincerely Gerson Martinez
Semper Fi.
