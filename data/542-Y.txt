I am strongly support OPT Extensions because of two reasons. 

First of all, International students benefit American Education. Not only have they paid for their expensive tuition and living expense, but also paying efforts on researching in both universities and NJH of United Status. Addition, American college are attractive for international student is that OPT policies. International students can find a job and acquire H1B Visa. Thats the advantage against Britain and Australia. I was admitted to University of Sydney before, but I decline their invitation because American OPT policies for STEM program. After I graduate, I have more chance to increase my work experience and make me competitive when I get to my homeland. Yes, I wan to accumulate working experience and find jobs in China. 

Secondly, OPT Extensions means that International student could work in American companies. Once cancelling OPT Extension policies, many students have to get back home. However, these talents play a significant role in increasing competitiveness for America companies, such as Google, Facebook, Uber. For example, Uber are undergoing explore Chinese market. In Chinese office, employees came from students who studies in STEM program and then worked in Uber headquarters. Assumed OPT extensions never support longer working time, and such students have no chance to get H1B Visa. Uber have to quit these students and they might work for the rivals of Uber in Chinese Market, called DiDi. Thats a disaster for Uber and damage the advantage of Uber in China.
