I highly recommend this new regulation for OPT program extension.

I was one of the benficials from the old extension regulation, and this regulation gives both my employer and me an opportunity to work with each other.

U.S. always provides an equal working environment for the people all around the world, this is a reason that why more and more talent young people want to study in U.S., and then contribute themself to this wonderful country.

Please keep this wouderful regulation, and we could work together to build this country more and more wonderful.

Best Regards,
Tony
