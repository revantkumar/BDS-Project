James Brown To be a stronger nation, is not based on narrowing the number of International workers, but oppositely, depending on the diversity wisdom and multi-culture. 

On the other hand, mostly international graduates have higher degree and do high-tech cool things, which bring powerful energy to our country and do not hurt the rights of guys who just can collect rubbish and make coffee. 

Our country need them and ought to give them more time to make contribution for our nation! 

So I strongly SUPPORT the extension of OPT!!!!!
