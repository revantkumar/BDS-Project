I am an international student in US and I have pursued a STEM degree and graduated in year 2015 with a master's degree in the field of Computer Science. I fully support this rule. This rule will help students to get valuable hands-on as well as educational experience. It will allow me to implement my knowledge in practical experience. 

More over, requirement of technical workforce is going to be increased in upcoming years. In this scenario, this rule will help United States to retain students which come with high educational background and make US economy more powerful with their technical abilities.
