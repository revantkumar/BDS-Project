Andrew Williams That's a great proposal. I am a native tech worker and I have great experience working with those smart students. I also learned a lot from their skills and ideas. I think our company can not afford losing those talented people suddenly. Please help to make sure the proposal works and we can have a more smooth transition in work and also for my life.
