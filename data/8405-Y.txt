I agree with the proposed rule for expanding OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students based on the following:
1. As mentioned in the proposal too, it will keep US to be attractive and competitive for international students seeking for oversea studies. just for 2013/2014, International students contributed more than $27 billion to the U.S. economy, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

2.International students are contributing good works in their jobs. The companies that are hiring international students are definitely not doing it for no reason. They won't be willing to pay extra money for international students while they are doing bad in their jobs. Excellent students around the world are now contributing to the US companies. 

3. Extension of OPT might relieve the need for H1-B visa applications. In other words, it will allow international students to keep contributing in US companies without the extra burden and cost for additional visas.
