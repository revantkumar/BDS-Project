There are variable benefits for American's economy and a sustainable future for US.

- Economy: international students who had been granted opportunity to work during their STEM OPT will be very likely to start their own business in the US, which in term create job opportunities for American people in general. Thus unemployment rate will go down.

- Sustainable future: international students will contribute to the diversity of the US culture, which will give birth to new innovation, creation, and eventually improve the economy. US history and prosperity is benefited by the diversity of people from all around the world. 

Nevertheless, people may argue that international students under STEM OPT will replace the limited job opportunities in the market, so US citizens will find it hard to find a job. However, the current unemployment observed in the economy ultimately resulted from the lack of operational business, limited job offers. In the long run, solving the unemployment problem can be remedied by the potential businesses created by the international students work under STEM OPT. Simply preventing international students to work under STEM OPT will be a short-sighted action, which will definitely be detrimental to the US economy beyond the short term. 

Hence, the government should grant international students to work under STEM OPT.
