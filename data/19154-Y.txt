I strongly support the rule ...... 

2 things i would like to add

1) I am a recent college graduate ... During my job search i have seen this that all companies give first preference to U.S. Citizens ... Go to any college career fair and this is clearly evident .. So i do not think that U.S. Citizens (specially students) will get affected in any way as they will still get preference... 
2) We want to learn and grow alongside U.S. citizens and this law allows us to do that ...

Hence... I SUPPORT THE RULE WHOLE HEARTEDLY

Thank you
