I think OPT extension is very necessary for technology companies and our economy. 

US takes advantage of advanced technology and great human capital over other countries, our economy lies greatly on technology companies. These companies need a lot of fresh students to work for them to reduce cost compared with hiring experiences person. And as we know, many students in Mathematics and Computer Science are international students, if there's really a short time for them to apply for future working authorization, then technology companies will need to hire new person and of course cost money because of this stuff change. And also if there's a short time for international students to work at our country, they may even go back to their home country. I would say at that time, who can work for our technology company? Who can work in this difficult and complex areas? Who can contribute to our economy? We will lose our advantages over other countries, which should definitely be avoided.

U.S should definitely think more about its advantage over other countries, the human capital is crucial which makes OPT extension necessary.
