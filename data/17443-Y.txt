Dear Chief Westerlund:

I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students," published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

As an international student, I graduated in December 2013 as a Ph.D in Mathematics. And I was glad that the OPT and OPT extension programs provided me great opportunities to apply my knowledge from the class to the real world and industry, and definitely I am confident that my knowledge and skills contribute the industry as all other international students did in there OPT and OPT extension. I would like to express my thankful to the program, and I would like to strongly support the new proposed OPT extension rules. Since with the new rule, all international students with advanced skills will have more opportunities and which will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.. 

As we know, most of the international students with STEM Degrees are of great skill sets and knowledge base and they represents the frontier science and technology, and OPT extension program not only provide those students great opportunities to realize their thinking, but also provide the US industry more fresh blood and fresh air, which will surely help the US industry about new projects, new programs and new future. 

As conclusion, the new OPT extension program will greatly benefit the students as well as US industry and economy. I, here, strongly support the new rule to be implemented by Feb 12, 2016.

Sincerely,

Huankun Fu
