I support the extension of OPT. I want to work and live in America. Because I want to give birth to many children and make them live a better life. I chose to come to USA instead of other countries. One reason is that STEM 29-month OPT give me a bigger chance to stay in liberal developed countries. 
I study and work here also contributes to America. There are three reasons. Firstly, I pay sixty thousand tuition this year. I also rent an appartment, buy a car and consume foods and clothes. As a foreigner consume goods and services in USA. I increase the net export, therefore the GDP of United States. Secondly, if I can find a job. My parent will help me buy a house here, since I am the only child of my finally. I think most of Chinese parents will do so. They will exchange RMB for US dollar and invest huge amount of money in houses. This will help to recover the construction market and also increase the GDP. Thirdly, many of Chinese graduates are elites of China. They graduated from best universities in China. They work hard and wish to contribute to USA society. They can be scientists, software developers and analysts. They can help USA keep prosperous. This will increas living standard of all the people. 
That is my opinions. I wish I can realize my American dream.
