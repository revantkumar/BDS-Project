This is definitely a good policy. Companies would benefit from that policy. Consider this situation: you hired a skilled foreign employee and spend months training him familiar with company issue but a year later you have to let him go away because of his limited opt period. That is a waste of time and money. Once the opt is extended,the new staff would have more time to make contribution to the company , which not only benefit the company but the staff himself! 
I remember the word a professor in aeroplane college says" For those foreign students who study this major we should never try to tryask them to go away. We spend money,spirit and time teaching them but turned out benefiting other countries. This action is quite stupid" Now the 12 month long opt is something like that stupid action. We need to extend that so that some of the foreign brilliant students could stay and work for the country!
I am looking forward to seeing the policy to be passed.
