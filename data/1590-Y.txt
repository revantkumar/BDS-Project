I truly support this rule.
The Industry and College co-ordination will get improved by the OPT program. So far, more and more colleges with STEM programs attracted international students. Without this rule, those internationals students will study in other countries like Canada, which are providing better opportunities for international students. US will suffer a huge loss. Where will universities and colleges get the fund from? Much less students will spend money in the restaurants, department stores, houses, apartments, etc.. The US government will not collect as much as tax from these payments like now!
