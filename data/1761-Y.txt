As a potential student, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. As the US economy has become better and better, we can see the growing demand for the STEM technician in the near future. At the same time, local students are not willing to do some work that only STEM students can do. So expanding the Training Opportunities for F-1 students will not impair the interest of domestic residents!
2. If the proposal has not been passed, there are huge numbers of STEM empolyees will come back to their countries and the domestic residents are not so competent for the job at that time which can lead to huge loss not only incomes but reputation for the high-tech company in USA!! And in a short period of time, the government will not find a good way to make up for the LOSSES!
