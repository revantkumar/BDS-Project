Hi There,

I think this is a great proposal and I completely agree with that. This gives F-1 students ample time to gain valuble experience after their education in US.

I also agree with all the proposals for the employers for e.g. to evaluate the employee's performance every 6 months. I know that lot of employers are already doing these things with their F-1 employees.

I would again like to emphasize my agreement this proposal and I would be very happy seeing this implemented.

thanks a lot for proposing this change.
