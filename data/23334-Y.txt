It is a good reform! In the job market, an experience could be more convincing an valuable if it is at least two years. A short term OPT does not really help either the employer to train and put a new employee to his position or the employee to really utilize this working experience to facilitate his future career. 
The extension does not hurt anybody because it is not a permanent immigration status. But it helps everybody in the job market. It is not a good thing for America companies to have good employees remaining in a transient status and couldn't really contribute to the the companies before the employees have to stop and leave.
