Andy Cao I support this rule. STEM OPT students have a very positive effect on U.S. economy and industry. First they pay full tuition to lots of U.S. colleges and the tuition becomes compensate and scholarships for U.S. students. The loss for colleges would be huge if we do not have OPT STEM extension to attract international students. Secondly, instead of taking jobs from U.S. workers, STEM students actually are important for many high-tech startups and new companies which produce more job positions like marketing, sales for U.S. workers. This is why the unemployment rate is decreasing since 2008. The high-tech industry really need these excellent students.
