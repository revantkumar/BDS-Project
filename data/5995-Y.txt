sai kamal sreeja veepuri I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.I would like to support this rule (stem opt extension to 24 months).As an international student studying masters(electrical engineering) here i have gained lot of knowledge and I would like to gain industry oriented experience after my graduation.To do so OPT is the best period.It really helps a lot of international students to apply what they have learned during their masters.So students can contribute to the US economy while gaining work experience.So it really matters a lot to us.The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates.Stem opt period length should me more in order to make innovations because we can't acheive anything in one day.It requires time.Moreover scientific innovation requires extensive research which requires time.So extending OPT stem extension from 17 months to 24 months is a good thing.I would really appreciate . The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates.
With this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.
