Jordan Valentino I agree with this proposal wholeheartedly, our country was founded by proud and hardworking emigrants who risked everything to get here. We shouldn't make it harder for students who came thousands of miles seeking better lives and contributing to our economy. Pass this extension as soon as possible!
