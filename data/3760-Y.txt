Wenjia Wang I support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. 

Being able to recruit talents around the world aligns with America's national interest. F-1 students consume our precious resources of higher education. America should not make the mistake to give up these highly-educated talents! We should keep them work for us! At least we should not drive them away because they are not American!
