I support this rule without any hesitation for the following two reasons.

1. STEM extension means more opportunities for those outstanding international graduates who may be otherwise forced to give up their excellent career plans (like building start-up, carry on their brilliant researches in companies or research centers). This rule obviously will help strengthen the competing ability of USA economy and science technology in the world.

2. From my perspective, one reason that USA is the most successful and attractive country in the world is that freedom, democracy and equality are most common concepts deep in every residence mind. If someone cannot gain opportunity to succeed due to his or her foreign indentity, USA lose attraction to him or her. In the long term, America will lose a number of potential excellent international schalors and businessmen who will choose to work in other better place like Europe. America cannot take that risk especially in today's world of international win-win cooperations.
