I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The U.S.A is proud of the freedom. Because of freedom spirit, The U.S.A has become the most attractive place in the world, thousands of talented people gather here to realize their dream. And this proposal is exactly representative of the freedom spirit. It provides convenience for these people who are pursuing their dreams, who are working hard to make the America better. 

2. What's more, there is no doubt that the world is becoming a whole group. Consequently, the transform of talented people and technology is the inreversible process. Limiting the opportunities of nonimmigrant students is just against this trend, and will be finally proved to be wrong.
