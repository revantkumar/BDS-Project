A Hall I fear my voice may be drowned out on this issue since the Tech Lobby is so well-funded and powerful, however, I hope those reading the comments and making the decisions will consider the adverse effects this rule already has on both foreign and native employment-seeking students. It seems that more and more late-career STEM professionals are being forced to retire early because they are replaced by younger, cheaper temporary foreign workers. I don't think it's right that companies can exploit loopholes to the detriment of sound professional Americans. This rule already provides a financial incentive for employers to hire foreign labor because they don't have to pay a payroll tax for them, whereas they would for Americans. Extending time only makes these employees more attractive for employers over similarly qualified American students, or even late-career professionals.

This is also not an ideal situation for the foreign students. Though in practice I'm sure they would love the opportunity to stay and work for longer, they do not have the same rights as other workers to unionize. This also might make hiring a foreign student more attractive to a company.

Perhaps if the program is short enough, employers will treat it as mutually beneficial training rather than a more long-term employment prospect that has both financial bargains (no payroll tax) and practical bargains (less bargaining power). If extensions keep being made, companies will use this program to undercut mid and late-career tech workers with higher salaries as they already do with H-1Bs. 

Thank you for your consideration.
