I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.

I just want to reject that some people say this would accelerate the competition, and some native students could hardly get a job. This kind of guessing is based on on truth. As I know, the hiring bar of a company is not based on the number of people applied. This is proved in every hiring season. If there're too much applicant, the company would probably close up the hiring season early, rather than waiting for half year or 8 months and then pick the best. It is the same as there're too less applicants. A company would not lower it's hiring bar to hiring a batch of people who are not capable to do the job well. 

Thus, a student getting a job or not is depending on his/her personal ability.
