Maoyang Li As a student pursuing a master's degree at US, I am really looking forward to the approval of this policy. As far as I am concern, the one year working experience is not very enough for a student to utilize and practice what him learn at school. In many IT companies, new employees can only work as an associate engineer on trivial issues for the first year, and only after a longer time period that they can work on something more important and challenging. The OPT extension policy can definitely help foreign students get into that area and have more contribution while gaining more experience. Also, if the OPT extension is approved, for many students who are planning to return to their home countries after accumulating two or three years working experience, they don't need to go into the complicated process of applying for a H1B. So the pressure of H1B application can also be relieved.
