I fully support the OPT STEM extension. F-1 students spend the same amount of money as US citizens to get an American education. The least we deserve is an opportunity to get some work experience here and give back to the economy. This rule does not give F-1 students permanent status. But it does give them an extra opportunity to get an H1B visa in the lottery system. H1B visas are issued according to the cap regardless of this rule. This at least increases the chances of more American educated students getting these visas instead of foreign workers; workers who haven't spent a cent in the American education system.
