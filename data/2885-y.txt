Bhadresh Karatela I suggest to have some consideration for those students who came to USA as dependent of their parents, however due to age of 21 they had to transfer to F1 status to study legally.

These students (STEM) have spent their childhood or teenage years in USA and are very much mixed in the society. Parents who stayed legally have paid all type of taxes including income tax, property tax, social security social etc. Its unfair to these students to struggle to obtain sponsor even to get a job.

I suggest any F1 student who has stayed more than 3 years in USA on dependents visa prior to switching to F1 visa due to age, should be given EAD after STEM graduation from USA university.
