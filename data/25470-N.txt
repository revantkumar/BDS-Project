It would make a lot more sense, in terms of the economy of the United States citizen, to encourage employers to take from the pool of unemployed citizens and to discourage employers from bringing in foreign workers. Does anyone in government care about the United States citizen? What ever happened to "of the people, by the people, and for the people?"
