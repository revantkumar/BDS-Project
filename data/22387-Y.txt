I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am an international student . Before planing to pursue my study overseas, I had many choices, USA, Canada, UK, Australia,... One of major reasons choosing US to continue my study is that we had better STEM training and studying opportunities, not only in the school, as well as in industries. One of the regulation supports for our STEM students is the OPT extension rule, which gives us more opportunities for training and studies. Without this support, it is hard to attract so many STEM foreign talents to contribute their skills and knowledge to the great nation. 

Besides, to my experience, most of projects in STEM fields will take more than one year to complete with, even more than 2 or 3 years. If a lot of projects terminates due to the failure of OPT-extension rule, then this country will lose a lot.
