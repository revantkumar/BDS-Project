I vehemently oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposal to expand the Optional Practical Training Program. This plan is so bad, it is hard to list and explain with any brevity:
1) MANY American, yes American STEM graduates are unable to find properly compensated work in their degree field. Why, pray tell, bring in more foreign workers to compete for too few jobs to begin with. Isn't the U.S. government supposed to work in the interests of Americans?
2) If companies hire foreign graduates under this program, then they can avoid paying their share of that individual's payroll taxes! Really, who came up with that one? So foreign employees cost an employer less, by virtue of not paying into the SSN system that is in dire financial straights. Is the common sense to jettison this absurd proposal that uncommon?
3) American Universities have become much too costly. This proposal would artificially increase the demand for STEM education, with no change in supply -- thus providing incentive to further raise education costs and create even more indebtedness for American graduates. The impact -- huge implications on the entire financial system when massive student debt defaults become the norm.

This proposal is so bad, I find it almost incomprehensible that it is even being considered! American government policies, in specific immigration, are to benefit America -- not provide financial incentives to Corporations to hire foreigners instead of Americans. Please send this proposal to "the circular file" where it belongs.

I look forward to being contacted for corroboration and/or further explanation.
