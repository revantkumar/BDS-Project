I strongly support OPT extension proposal for the following reasons:

First of all, excellent International students have brought and will continuous bring benefits to U.S, especially the IT industry. It is obvious that IT industry really need the contributions of international students because they can bring creativity and energy. If OPT extension is omitted, many IT comanies, including hugh leading comanies will be impacted, which will finally have bad influence on U.S's economics.

Secondly, International students and their famalies can create many economic growth points to U.S. As we all know, if the proposal is denied, the number of International students, even travelers will go down. Many people in America will lose their jobs because of this.
