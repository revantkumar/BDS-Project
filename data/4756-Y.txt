Keep STEM extension is DEFINATELY a double win for both companies in US and international students. On student perspective, one year training period is barely enough for a transition from university to industry that people would need to start to look for new job in their home country before gets settle in their job and contribute anything to the company. If extension is eliminated, company would have less incentive to offer full time position to international students, as one year is not much different than a internship, and many company would prefer a longer term contribution. It's not fare for the students who would otherwise looking for job when they don't have the ability to access the resource and interview outside U.S. during college time.

On the othe side, the extension is much more of a benefit to our society. The university spends a huge investment on educating students and it's a loss for us to let these students work for their country directly. With a 24 month extension, we allow the educated students to contribute to our country for a short period of time with no cost on their social insurance and pension, medical care when they gets old, etc. Also they usually don't work long enough to promote to administrative rule/high income job. Especially for the graduate school, many of the students receive fellowship and we literally pay them, educate them, and let them go? many people think the foreign workers crowd out domastic employees, which is not likely true. In almost all circumstance the companies are very biased when they recruit students because of the extra paperwork, visa issue, and the short contribution time of the foreign students. So i would say if a person don't get job, it's more likely the person is unqualified with or without competition. How can we possibly develop by disabling smart people WE educated to work for us
