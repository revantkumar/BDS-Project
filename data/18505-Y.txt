International students are playing an increasingly important role in many fields in the states and are making huge contribution to our country. I am in favor of expanding the Training Opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees. I am quite convinced they'll make huge difference if they can put their specialized skills into the industry. Just in my company, my international colleagues can always bring in new insights with their solid mathematical foundation as well as computer programming skills. They are quite efficient and diligent. 

It is kind of shortsighted to be against to the new policy, the American people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions.
