I strongly oppose this attempt to create a new, and even worse, source by which US corporations and universities can import yet more exploitable foreign STEM labor. American technology workers increasingly oppose the H-1B program and other means by which US corporations and universities seek to import cheap, indentured labor. This OPT proposal, like its predecessors, is a too-clever attempt by Big Academia and Big Tech to subvert the H-1B caps which American technology workers strongly support.

As Ron Hira et al have shown, there is no need for degreed graduates of US STEM academic programs to be treated as interns in need of 3 years of further training. This OPT provision merely seeks to provide Big Tech's bosses with more cheap, indentured labor, circumventing the H-1B cap. As Daniel Costa notes, this proposal allows bosses to decide whatever wage is appropriate for the OPT foreign worker, and this proposal's worker protections "are so vague and deferential to employers that they will be virtually unenforceable in practice in any meaningful way." This proposal will only serve to further depress already-stagnant STEM compensation and working conditions, and to force more US citizens to seek alternate career paths.

As John Miano indicates, this OPT proposal requires US corporations and universities to provide mentoring programs for OPT-eligible *foreign* students, but not for citizen students. This OPT plan, like (but even worse than) its predecessors, will only increase the US STEM brain drain by driving talented citizen students out of STEM, and to replace them with foreign students who are (as Norman Matloff has demonstrated) no more talented (on a variety of measures), but who are much more profitable for US corporations and universities. This OPT plan will also aggravate the age discrimination in US STEM, which has increased in severity as succeeding US administrations have increased importation of young, cheap foreign labor.
