Gene Nelson, Ph.D. The attached article, which I wrote and had published in Winter, 2014 outlines some of the harms to experienced American citizen technical professionals such as myself that have occurred as a consequence of employer abuse of both the H-1B Visa program and the OPT extension to the F-1 (student) Visa program. These economic harms are some of the reasons why many economists label the anemic recoveries following the 2001 recession and the severe economic contraction that began in 2007 as "jobless recoveries." - Almost all of the new higher-skill jobs are going to the abundant imported "fresh young blood" supplied via employer abuse of both work visa programs. For these reasons, the proposed DHS ICEB regulation should be rejected. I have already established in my previous filings that the OPT program should be immediately terminated.
