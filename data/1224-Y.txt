I support the new rule for OPT STEM program.
It's generally known that high tech development is critical to a nation in that information era. One of the principal reasons that United States holds world's leading position in economy and technology is that US gathers most talneted people around the world. Foreign students in STEM majors receive diversified and better education and have professional skills, which are more qualified for work in high tech fields. If they don't have extension OPT period, many of them would be forced to leave US according to current H1B condition. The outflow of the skilled and professional people will cause unexpected losses to America. Policy makers of a nation shall hold a long-term perspective, and consider deliberately on this beneficail and constructive new rule.
