I think it makes sense to expand and lengthen the training for STEM students. They are some the brightest students from many different nations and that will be a great advantage to helping our country to advance and remain one of the leading countries in the world. Not only will they be helping us in their contribution but will also help us to better determine the best and brightest to keep in our country. 

On a practical level the United States will also benefit economically from what they purchase and spend and also their taxes.

So I believe it would be beneficial for the United States to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees and CapGap relief for all eligible F-1 Students.

Sincerely,

Benjamin L Long
