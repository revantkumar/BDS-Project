I support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It will make the talented and skilled foreign students contribute their knowledge and skill to the company they work for for a longer time. We know that a foreign worker must have a valid visa to work in US but however some talented foreign workers have to go back to their country if they don't win in the H1B lottery. It is a pity for them and even a pity for their employer. The extension of OPT will give them more opportunity to submit their H1B application and more chance to get their visa.

2. I saw some comments which oppose the OPT extension said the OPT extension will reduce the chance for US citizen to get their jobs. I do admit that more foreign students trying to find a job in US will make the competition fiercer. BUT I don't agree with their implication that OPT extension will threat their opportunity to find a job. The employer or HR staff of a company have a systematic system to find who is the best for their company. Foreign students and American students will have the equal chance to compete for the job. OPT extension won't reduce the equality.

3. I come from China and now study in US. Before I came to US, I was always inspired by the spirit of US-Freedom, Equality, Democracy, Open. After I arrived, I do have the strong sense for these spirits. But now I saw the negative comments on this proposal, I am a little sad and disappointed. I want to tell those who think ill of the proposal that please have a open mind for the foreign workers and the competition and cooperation with them will give you a different perspective of doing things.
