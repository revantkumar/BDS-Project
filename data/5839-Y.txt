As a foreign student who is planning to study in America for my graduate degree, I really think it is a great policy, for both Americans and foreign students.
1. Most foreign students who come to USA for study are really smart and hardworking. Being admitted by American universities is not that easy. And among my friends, those who are studying in America now are really really excellent students. If they have more chance in America, they can do more contribution to A merica economy.
2. STEM subjects, although important, are not popular among American students. However, foreign students, especially Chinese and Indian students, are talented in these subjects. In this sense, giving more opportunities to foreign students with STEM subjects will not cause many Americans losing their jobs since they are competing in different areas.
3. America has always been proud of her tolerance, equity and diversity, And that's why so many young intelligent people are attracted to this country. Prejudice should not be reason for opposing this policy.
