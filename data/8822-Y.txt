I agree with OPT extension. The rapid development of economy depends on science tech. For example, in statistic, big data is the most popular topic. It is very powerful and also it needs professional technicist with high edication. In fact, most students in this major are foreigners. They are irreplacable. And STEM only includes four majors. It can not cause the unemployment rate rises. No ome can say that because lots of coder or analysts are fired, the unemployment rate rises. It will never happen. Oppositely, lots of campanies need them who master this skill. 

On the other hand, new powerful tech can help economic develope again. Besides, it gives these foreigners chances to get American dream, Democracy,Rights, Liberty, Opertunity and Equality.
