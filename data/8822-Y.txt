Steve Su Hi

I strongly support the rule of extending the OPT period.

My name is Steve Su, and originally was an F-1 student studying engineering in Tufts university. 
My experience working in the US supports that most STEM students will have a positive impact to the US economy in the long run. 

After graduating, I worked for many US companies, like Microsoft (working on the Win 95 project), Citibank, Goldman Sachs. I made my contribution to the US economy.

Best Regards

-Steve Su
