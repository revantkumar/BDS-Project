I strongly support this OPT extension rule. Some people proposed that OPT extension will lower the average salary in America because employers will pay less to hire international students and make US citizens have less opportunities to find a job. In my opinion, it will not have those negative impacts. Because STEM students can only look for the jobs related to their majors, and actually the salary of these technical jobs is much higher than the local average salary. Therefore, the OPT extension rule will not harm US citizens benefits, instead, it will attract talents from all over the world to make contributes to America.
