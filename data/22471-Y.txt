I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities. We need to give the best and the brightest students every opportunity to succeed in the U.S. I am a retired professor who engaged in research and teaching graduate students. Some of our best students were foreigners. Not enough Americans go into research and other fields where we need more people if the US is to continue to create new innovations. We need these students here in the US.
