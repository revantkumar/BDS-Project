When I decided to come US to get my Master degree, I considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension. Because I think OPT and it's extension period is necessary for me to have a deeper understanding of my field of study and help develop the computer science knowledge and skill.
Right now I work at a world big internet company and doing product development job. I think it's a really great opportunity for me to learn so much skills and knowledge.
I'm already in my STEM OPT extension, so if the government cancel it, I probably should go back to China immediately. I still need more time to learn, which is important to me.
so the OPT extension is really important to me.
