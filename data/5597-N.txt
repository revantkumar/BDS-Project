The OPT jobs giveaway program is so bad, even the pro-amnesty AFL-CIO came out against it. Richard Trumka said that OPT and similar guest worker programs "do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum, let alone the prevailing wage."

Now, think about this. American colleges produce about 300,000 STEM graduates per year. Many of them already cannot find jobs in their fields. This new expanded OPT program Obama is pushing through will swamp the job market with cheap, no-tax foreign workers angling to become permanent. STOP THIS DIRTY PROGRAM NOW!!!!
