I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 12 months' length can not meet the demand of most high tech companies as the STEM fields are developing so fast. In the field I am working in(VLSI chip design & verification), Most project are required 1~1.5 years, especially when it in terms of chip production. Not to mention other research level project. Removed of the job searching time, 3~8 months, the time left for us even less than half years. The company have to transfer work to other employee if OPT has been stopped. New training and transferring may cause large wasting of the developing funds. 

Also, International students have made significant contributions to the United States, both on U.S economy an diversity culture exchange. OPT is a most attractive respect for these students since most of us came here to gain knowledge and competitiveness in job market. A experience of working abroad can strongly support that. As i mentioned earlier, removed of the job searching time, 3~8 months, the time left for us even less than half years. It can hardly gain the industry experience. Without a longer time for OPT, decrease of international student may slow down the U.S economic growth. 

In all, OPT extension to 24 months is a very wise decision.
