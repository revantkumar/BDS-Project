Vincent Sockalosky My Grandparents were immigrants, I have nothing against them. But there were no free rides back then. I don't understand why we allow immigrants not to pay taxes when our Social security system is in bad shape. Why did OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds by doing this.
Give Americans a better chance than someone who isn't a citizen.
