Daisy Dai I totally accord with this proposal. 

As a matter of fact, domestic companies would prefer hiring a domestic student/person, because hiring an international student may cause simultaneous problems and have to go through complex processes. However, why there are still a portion of international students got hired, it is because of the lack of talented people in STEM industries. There are not a lot of domestics interested in learning science, hence America has to import more talented employees from aboard. From this proposal, I can see the necessary of extending the OPT for STEM major students. The more extension would support the domestic companies to simplify the process of hiring an international student, at the same time, these foreign students can contribute to the United States' development, especially among STEM areas. From my perspective, extending OPT for STEM students provides more advantages than disadvantages.

I can understand that there are so many people worrying about the competitions introduced by international students. However, the more intense competitions are among international students, not between domestic students and international students. Each company has limited position opening to international, therefore, only the best candidate can be selected. By all means, there will only be elite group of international students promoting the development of the United States.
