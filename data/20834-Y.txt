This is a good proposal. It'll be a win-win for USA and F1 students by Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees. Talented students could practice their skills and do lots of creative work in their field. American economy will increase a lot from the hard working of these students. 
Some guys comment that the government should leave theses jobs of high technique for American students. But on contrary, lack of competition will result in the falling of local students. BTW, IT or other companies always give priority to American students unless they can't hold the job at al. So the worry is meaningless.
