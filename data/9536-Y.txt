I obsoletely agree on the OPT 24-months extension. Because as I know, most of the IT companies such as google, facebook, amazon etc. hire these international people to work. The IT industry influence on the economy growth of the U.S.. So if these people can not get the valid working status on our country, it will directly influence on the economy development. 

Actually I don't mind if these people take some positions in our country. Diversity is very important for the U.S. and the competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.
