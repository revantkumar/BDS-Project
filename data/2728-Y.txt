Yongping Zha I was once a STEM major student and benefited from the OPT extension. Without OPT extension, many well-educated international students won't be able to stay in US and contribute to the scientific and technological advances in this country. It will be a huge loss to US economics too. Killing the OPT extension is killing the future of US.
