I do support the OPT-extension and I really can't understand the reason not to extend it for the STEM students. Those who stand on the other point might not have the basic idea of what STEM stands for. For those jobs requires solid background and lots of practical training of technology, computer science and related ones, the people who fill in the huge demand gap are the STEM students. They worked hard for number of long-term projects extending for years long and might stopped during the progress because of the regulation.

From the whole recruiting process, it's hard to say international students took the natives' opportunities cuz you're not regarding those jobs as boutique jobs, but more likely to go in for finance services, consulting industry, or to work as a lawyer, banker or doctor. Literally, hardly do Americans fascinate with coding or data cleaning work, since they think it of dirty work, but these work happen to be the foundation of your technology and finance empire, with the support of tremendous mined data sets or coding lines. If OPT can't be extended, lots of the IT firm will loose their working power in minutes since STEM students are making their efforts to build those companies, so does the U.S. economy. 

Go and ask those recruiting team in a hi-tech company, they will tell you there always exists a big hole in IT talents. Do you still believe the unemployment rate belongs to the STEM students? Why no one fills up the huge whole? Why not give STEM students more opportunities?
