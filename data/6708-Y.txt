Clayton Wong OPT extension for STEM majors is essential for bridging the "cap gap". It's meaningful for both F1 students as well as the increasing demand from STEM fields. To maintain the leading position of the US in STEM fields, we need more talented people to join. The shortage of the talents is very obvious. American don't like learn STEM and think they are geeky and nerdy. It's time to encourage the competition to make American involve to STEM field. Extension the OPT for STEM can help alleviate the shortage of STEM workforce in the short term, and also help to revitalize the American education system. I definitely agree with the extension of OPT.
