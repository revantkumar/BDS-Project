I am from business area, not STEM, but I think graduates from engineering schools are contributing a lot to the states. I use Google, Facebook, Uber a lot and I often appreciate those engineers making such great products. I know these high tech companies hire International students because they are smart, creative and hard-working. They pay higher tax because they are not Americans and they can't even have the benefits like Medicare and society security.

Not only do international students pay higher tax rate when they work, they also pay much higher tuition than normal students. They rent apartments, go to restaurants, shop clothes and food, which actually helps increase the job opportunity, especially in college town.

I think that some people are complaining about International students taking jobs is because they don't realize the real reason that some people lose their jobs. I read an article today from NY Times-Large Companies Game H-1B Visa Program, Costing the U.S. Jobs. It reveals that outsourcing companies like Tata Consultancy Services, known as TCS, Infosys and Wipro game the visa system and bring a lot of workers from overseas. They took far more jobs than International students. I think if this problem is solved, there won't be more americans lose jobs because of foreign workers.
