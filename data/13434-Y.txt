I strongly support this proposal!!

#1: Go to Silicon Valley an count how many foreigners are working there helping maintain the most prestigious tech companies of United States, if OPT ext never exist, I'm sure all this tech kingdom will collapse (or never been established)

#2: Most of grad students major in Engineering in United States are foreigners. They paid a lot for the tuition and cost of living. Most of these foreigners are from developing country and they are the best students in their own country. But they willing to come to United States to explore their possibilities of life that they couldn't get in their home country. Shouldn't United States the best destination for these hardworking people to realize their dream? This proposal is definitely the best guarantee for these respected people to fight for their life.

#3: This proposal only benefits for these students who has been educated in United States's education system for at least one degree. Then I can assure these students are way better than average people (American citizens) in at least one field. And this point make sure they are qualified for a decent job and contribute to this society.

#4: Wake up people! This country's technology industry and education are largely relay on Asians, in other words, this proposal.

Best, have a nice day.
