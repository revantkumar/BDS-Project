America has a history of immigrant workers. They help American economy grow as much as natives, rather more. So many international students come every year to pursue under grad and graduation studies. They generate so much revenue for the schools and university. They generate demand for housing and rental communities. These students help grow restaurant and consumer businesses. And then, they help companies like google, facebook, amazon, cisco, etc to innovate and reach where they are currently. They help the tech industry innovate and expand. So from start to end, it's the American economy benefiting directly or indirectly. They help USA, be USA. If this rule does not pass, then a new silicon valley would grow in some other part of the world. It would be America's loss. No one else'd.
