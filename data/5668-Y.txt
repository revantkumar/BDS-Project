MARRY ANDERSON I STRONGLY SUPPORT this OPT-extension rule. 

STEM OPT extension helps to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. As a master student, I have had offers from U.S., UK and Germany when applying for graduate school. I came to U.S. because I believe it will better prepare me for a professional career in the OPT and the extension period. Though tuition in U.S., especially in private school, is huge amount of money, I still feel it worthwhile if I am able to develop professional skills, and also to have enough time to gain practical experience in the industry because I will have excellent resume to bring back to China. One year experience is not convincing enough for students whod like to show their achievements here to employees in their homeland, and this will deduce the attraction of U.S. academical industry.

OPT-extension helps U.S to remain or even increase its attraction to international students. the IIE and NAFSA reports confirm that the United States, which hosts more of the worlds 4.5 million globally mobile college and university students than any other country, remains a destination of choice for higher educationfor now. Due to increased competition from other countries, the U.S. lost nearly 10 percent of its market share of international students in 10 years, declining from 28 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2011. Without immigration reform to help remove barriers that prevent some students from studying in the U.S. or remaining here after they finish their degrees, the U.S. is missing out on enormous benefits. We must find a way to make the United States a more welcoming nation, a value upon which this country was founded, Johnson said. If Congress doesnt take action and pass commonsense, comprehensive immigration reform, we will lose talented international students. The billions of dollars they contribute to this nation, along with the invaluable academic and cultural contributions they bring, will be at risk.
