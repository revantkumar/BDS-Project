Joyce Lee First of all, I strongly support this proposal. Last year, our company hired hundreds of new-grad international students. Most of these staffs didn't have the opportunity to get the H1B visa in the last lottery. If there is no extension of OPT, these international staffs would have to leave their position. The time and money our company spend on training these staffs would be wasted. Also our company would have to spend more time on hiring appropriate people and training them. 

Loss of international staffs would not only affect our company's development -- as the company which provides EMR for a huge amount of hospitals in the U.S., we are in the critical stage to innovate our software. The slow down of our step will also affect hospitals who use our software and related patients. 

From my own point, I am currently an international student work with OPT. I choose to work for our company because there is no such a excellent EMR system in my hometown. I know some hospitals in Singapore use our company's product. I hope one day I could contribute to our company's development in China, or at least enhance the business tie. If these is no extension of OPT and I don't have the fortune to get H1B, I have to change all my career plan.
