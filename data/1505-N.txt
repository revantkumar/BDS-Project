Our Department of Homeland Security has proposed to expand Optional Practical Training (OPT) which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans. A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies showed two disturbing results about the OPT program that the DHS proposes to expand:
--OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.
I find this unconscionable since so many Americans are unemployed. Our elected representatives are more concerned with providing cheap labor for The Chamber of Commerce than providing jobs for Americans.

--OPT removed $4billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. This is shameful considering these two programs have deep financial problems.

In addition, Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa raised his concerns about this program expansion in a letter to President Obama:
--"the proposed regulations are irresponsible and dangerous considering the Government Accountability Office (GAO)report issued in March 2014 finding that program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible fraud, and the Department was not adequately overseeing it."
--"The report also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country." "The GAO said, 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the U.S.'"
Because this country is experiencing enough problems with illegal immigration, we do not need anymore incentives to make these problems worse.

I agree with Senator Grassley that there needs to be a moratorium on OPT approvals. As he stated in his letter to President Obama, "OPT is meant to be a temporary training, not a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans.
America has many of the best and brightest STEM workers right here, so
