I strongly support this policy for the following reasons:
1. America is a equal and prosperous country, all man are created equal, and all right should be respected. As an immigration country, there is no "native American" exist. If your ancestor hadn't "took" other "Americans"' job, there is no "American" exist.
2.The international students who get their OPT and finally get their job in the U.S. is minority. This international education industry nowadays offered countless jobs in the U.S. If we give no chance to international students, do you think they will still choose U.S. to study? And how many jobs we will lost?
3. This in not a society which only support loser, if we don't bring in new blood, and take the innovation, our society will collapsed.
