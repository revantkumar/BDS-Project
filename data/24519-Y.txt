Administrations and Congress both have been counterproductive concerning the cost of undergraduate and graduate study for the young who are citizens of this country. In addition, this practice of bringing in immigrants especially in technical fields if they have funds to buy their way in or are in occupations in Big Tech and Healthcare and are willing to work for less. Our young are often closed out of these professions or are in debt for many years because of the constant increases in the costs of study. Our young are literally victims of the "double whammy". When do we hold corporations and universities responsible for the deplorable conditions that preclude many of our talented young from entering into our essential professions and allowing foreign nationals to complete studies at lesser costs and to enter essential jobs because they are willing to work for less? THIS NATION MUST STOP THESE NEGATIVE AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE POLICIES!!
