I OPPOSE the proposed rule for Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. This will take away jobs from our college graduates who are qualified for these jobs. It's time to give Americans the opportunity to obtain these jobs and also enforce the rules stating that those here on F-1 Student visas leave in the time frame specified by the law after obtaining their degrees.
