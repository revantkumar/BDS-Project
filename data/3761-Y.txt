I would definitely support this proposed rule for the following reasons.

(1)Student holding F-1 visa have all received higher education in the U.S., which equip them with knowledge and skills in jobs that can benefit their employers. It would definitely be a loss to the U.S. if these foreign people only come to the U.S., benefit from the high quality education and leave the country right away without enough contribution.

(2)Student with STEM degrees have very specific and cutting-edge knowledge and skills which make them irreplaceable in many positions. In this case, the expanding training opportunities is not reducing the job opportunities for the general domestic U.S. citizens. On the contrary, it would better serve the U.S. by constantly boost the advance of technology and economy.

(3)Over the years, students with STEM degrees have used their innovation and skills to launch a great number of start-up companies which created even more job openings. This also make sure that the U.S. maintain the leading position in science and technology.

(4)These students come from all over the world which adds to the multi-culture of the U.S. Ever since its establishment, the U.S. has been benefiting from this mixture of culture, thinking and knowledge. It is very important for this country to remain friendly to all talents and open to foreigners.

With the above comments, I would highly recommend that our government officials consider favorably of this proposed rule.

Thank you!
