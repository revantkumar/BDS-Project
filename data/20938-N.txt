I am opposed to any extension of the OPT work period. The F-1 Visa program is not properly monitored to begin with. Often foreign students are granted these visas to attend "schools" that are merely storefronts and not legitimate educational institutions. In addition, there is no monitoring for attendance by these visa holders. The F-1 program is just another route for illegal entry into the U.S. and this OPT program just ensures these visa holders will remain in the U.S., take jobs away from US citizens and will ultimately remain in the U.S. without any restriction, fine or monitoring.
