I SEE NO REASON WHY FOREIGN STUDENTS (MOSTLY CHINESE) WHO ARE HERE ON STUDENT VISAS BUT WHO ARE CITIZENS OF ANOTHER COUNTRY HAVE THE RIGHT TO COMMENT ON AMERICAN GOVT MATTERS LIKE THIS DOCKET. THESE PEOPLE ARE WRITING IN TO GET BENEFITS FOR THEMSELVES ON AMERICAN LOSSES. THAT HSOULD NOT BE ALLOWD AT ALL AT ANY TIJME. HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON. WE NEED TO PUT A STOP TO IT IMMEDIATELY. THEY CERTAINLY HAVE BENEFITS THEY ARE LOOKING TO KEEP WEASELING IN ON--AMERICAN JOBS. THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE HEARD BY OUR GOVT WHEN THEY ARE FOREIGNERS AND CITIZENS OF ANOTHER LAND. THEY NEED TO BE MADE TO IDETNFIY THEMSELVES WHEN THEY WRITE IN, NOT ACT AS IF THEY ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS. THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THEIR OWN ENRICHMENT AND THEY ARE FOREIGNERS. I VERY MUCH AM OPPOSED TO ALLOWING THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENCE AND IN OTHER INCIDENCES. AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE THE ONLYH ONES WHO SHOULD BE HEARD ON AMERICAN SPENDING AND AMERI CAN MATTEERS. I WOULDNT BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY AND IT SHULD NOT BE ALLOWED HERE IN AMERICA. THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEACHING OFF AMERICA NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED AND NOT BE ALLOWED TO TALK ON AMEICAN GOVT MATTERS. WHAT THE HELL BENEIFT DOES IT BE BEING AN AMERICAN CITIZEN IF YHOU GIVE THIS RIGHT TO EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE WORLD. THIS NEEDS ATTENTION. THIS COMMENT IS FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD. THE FOREIGNERRS DIDNT USED TO BE SO BOLD ABOUT SEEKING BENEFITS FOR THEIR OWN ENRICHMETN AND OUR LOSSES. PLEASE RECEIPT. JEAN PUBLIEE JEANPUBLIC1@YAHOO.COM
