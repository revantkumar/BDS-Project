The policy to improve and expanding the OPT STEM Extension is an effective and helpful for F-1 nonimmigrant students. The extension to 24 months from the current 17 months will be more appropriate for these student to get a higher chance to obtain H1b visa for industry employment. I would like to strongly recommend to extension of the OPT STEM Extension to 24 months and the implement of this policy can retain more international talents for the benefits of US.
