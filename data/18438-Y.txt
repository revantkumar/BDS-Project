Competition makes the United States a better country. We are talented people from Stanford, MIT, Harvard, CMU etc. We can find a great job anywhere in the world, honestly. It is the government's choice to decide whether we leave or serve other countries. We are fine wherever. I think the government is smart enough to understand how important and precious the highly educated people are.
