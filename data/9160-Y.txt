Sending back international students would lead a short-term, illusive relief to the job market because of fewer competitors. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to lose ground to the countries that welcome these students. STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and even create jobs for the country they serve for. Driving our highly educated brains to other countries is a great loss.
