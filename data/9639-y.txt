Minyu Cai I fully support the rule. To be more specific, I think the 24-month OPT extension is appropriate. Projects in STEM area usually take several years to complete. The 24-month extension allows STEM students to participate in a normal-length project which is a vital part of professional training. For example, I'm a student studying Electrical Engineering. I did an internship this summer at Cummins Power Generation. I was involved in a 3-year R&D project just initiated. If I join the company as a full-time employee next year, I'd like to continue working on the project which is still 2.5 years away from its completion. With the 24-month extension, the company will feel more comfortable letting me work on the project. From my perspective, if I'm able to be involved in the whole process of the project and contribute to the final result, I'll have the training and experience which I can't get in a university. With that, I'll be more competitive in the job market. Nowadays, many people from my home country, China, have degrees earned abroad. A US-university degree alone is not valued as high it was 10 or 20 years ago. The working experience on a complete project will definitely give me the advantage over students graduated from countries that don't provide this kind of training opportunity. Therefore, I think the 24-month extension is crucial to my career development and it can be the reason why studying in the US is still valuable.
