I strongly support this rule! 
1. International students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills and knowledge after graduation.
2. It is good for universities and whole education in US to attract more and more talented students to study.
3. People are supposed to have equal chance to work, also talented international employees are able to make major contributions to US, especially in STEM fields.
