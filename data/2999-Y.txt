Satiya Witzer I support this rule for one obvious reason.
The corporation will not be forced to hire under-qualified people. If they can't find enough qualified people, they will leave.
They can, and they will, move Google to Canada, Facebook to London and Apple to Ireland, if they can't hire smartest and brightest people here simply because of their immigration status, and they will ruin entire towns or region's economy in the process. Is that we the people want to see? 

Those that says you are qualified IT person. Did you really ever writes even a linear regression model in R? Do you even know how to do kernel manipulation in Matlab? Do you know how to style the code for model-view-controller? Your "IT" just means installing OS and deleting waste file for your client only, right? How can that make you qualify for ANY JOB in Silicon valley?
