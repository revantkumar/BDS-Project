Extending OPT will only benefit US economy, because tech companies need well-trained college graduates or advanced degree holders, many of whom are not US-citizens, to work for them. The longer OPT is, the more time these skillful people can work for US companies before being potentially forced to return to their home countries, and thus the more they can contribute to US economy. Without them, many US companies will have a hard time recruiting qualified workers, which will obviously harm US economy and cause US to lose in the global competition of high technology - this would be by no means beneficial to US citizens. Rather, it would be a waste of the talent of these students and the educational resources invested on them from the perspective of the United States. Why not let them contribute to US economy more before they leave?
