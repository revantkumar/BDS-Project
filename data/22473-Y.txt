Hi Sir/Madam, 

I am an international student in Chicago, IL and am currently working in an Insurance company. 
I believe extending this the OPT program from 17 months to 24 months is extremely important to me, because it provides me opportunities to get a extra shot for the H1b application. 
As you know there are more and more people (Oversee application from India) applying H1b recent years, the likelihood of success from this lottery has gotten historical low. 
To provide a better chance for top talented people for us to contribute our expertises and knowledge in improving US economics, it is crucial that we have more available times to actually stay here and work. 

For me and other international students, we are struggling hard to learn knowledge and find a good career opportunity in the Market, but sometimes the H1b lottery will block our journey here. 
I am sincerely looking for this proposal to get approved which will give us more chance and exposure to develop US economy. 

Thanks for reading. 
Have a nice day
