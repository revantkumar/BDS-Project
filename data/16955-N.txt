Why would anyone think they could justify displacing American workers with foreigners? It makes no sense when ther are 94 Million Americans who have given up looking for work? When we have the lowest worker participation rate in decades?
I strongly object to taking these jobs away from Americans like Disney and Southern California Edison has done!
