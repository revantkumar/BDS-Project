San Zhang This proposal, at least to U.S. society, is benificial in several aspects.
First, without the arrival of international students, local U.S. students will feel less pressured or motivated to keep up their paces with the world.

Furthermore,the overall productivity of U.S. might raise up by international population because most of those immigramts may have been determined to settle down in U.S. Even the increase in national population might threats the local people's benefit, the general circumstance will as well be alimeorated. This is trade-off decision making. (By the way, people who complain the severe consequences commonly take less persistence with their professions, not enduring to hold their own position)

Finally, U.S. is widely recognized democractic nation which is famous for its ideological liberality and cultural diversity. If this proposal was enacted, those immigrants who benefit from the proposal will bring the impression that U.S. is a place where the dream can be achieved back their howm countries, further reinforcing the international position of U.S., allowing more international elites entering U.S.
