I definitely think the extension of OPT program is good for United State. 
Although some people think that the extension of OPT program for STEM degrees would occupy the positions that means belong to United State citizen. However, the thing is that opportunities are equal for everyone. There almost no company is willing to hire international students only other than local people. In fact, more and more international student could be hired is due to their excellent skills, which are the companies look for. Moreover, it is much easier for a company to hire someone who do not need sponsor. Thus why they still look forward new graduate international student? The answer is the competence. For a company, the skill set is the most important thing, which could significantly benefit the company. Therefore, the extension of OPT program is more than benefit to most of the companies and industries since there would be more choice for them when hiring. 
Besides, if the extension of OPT was rejected, there will be a large amount of current international employees go back to their own countries. This will definitely cause a crisis since it is impossible to hire this amount of new employees in a short time. Especially large corporations in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Apple, and Facebook. Abrogating the OPT extension will lead a employee regression, and even a regression in economics.
