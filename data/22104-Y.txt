Allowing f-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees to have longer OPT period not only attracts more outstanding international students to stay and serve the country but also benefit the ongoing research of many US universities, thus improving the higher-level education of the US.
The percentage of international students and researchers in universities, researching institutions and high-tech companies is growing rapidly. These golden minds and hard-working people have made a huge contribution to multiple fields of research. I myself is working in a university-affiliated lab focusing on the genetic nature of heart defects. 50% of researchers, including graduate students, staff scientists and undergraduate students, are not citizens. Still, we have had novel findings that benefit not only our lab and university, but also to the country.
