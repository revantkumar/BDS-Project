I strongly support the extension to OPT. STEM students are constantly making noticeable contributions to many global leading companies in science and technology. They are part of the major force that boosts the economy and the technology in the United States. Employers are not giving privileges to F-1 STEM students over the native. They hire those STEM students simply because they are capable of carrying out the company's plans and goals. In the job market, STEM students have, and should continue to have equal opportunities.
