I support this new policy with all my heart. Accepting, celebrating and hugging great talents from all the world is the foundation of USA. Everyone has the same opportunity to earn a happy life in this dreamland and this is the time we tell those great students their dream can come true. Also, it will endow those US citizens more momentum to study harder and be more active in job market.
