xinyu yuan Strongly agree!
This extension rule give both international student and also industrial a benefit.
America is a country stand on it's justice and freedom. People come here to chase there dream and also contribute to this country, just as what people done in the NEW ENGLAND hundred years ago. It's naive to treat international people as a threaten since we all want to make our living environment better, and as long as we are in the U.S, we do contribute to here. Why can't everyone just work together to create a better society.
And for those industrial, only by hiring international student can they gain enough employee to develop new thing. We are not here to complete with native, but to cover the insufficiency. People knows America lead the technology of the world, but people may ignore a number of new things are invented by international research, or developed by international employee. If no international employee, international researchers are allowed, how can the company in Silicon valley keep growing? Can people still have the new iphone once pre year? Hi-tech brings huge convenience to the society and there should be no reason to slow down it's development speed.
