I totally agree with this great proposal! The expanded OPT period will definitely help a lot for international STEM graduate students who are willing to contribute to the united states after finished their professional training, in addition, I know many international STEM students in our university, they create their own start ups which not only promote the advance of the new technology but also helps create more jobs! Without their STEM extension, many of them won't be able to have enough time to make their start ups grown!
