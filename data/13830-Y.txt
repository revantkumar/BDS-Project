I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons. 

1) Because of OPT and its extension, America provides great opportunities for the students all over the world to learn their interested area, not only in the class but in the real industry with real practice. These make the America the most attractive country for higher education in the world.

2) I personally feel that industry experience, if not more, at least as important as academic learning. As a student, I know there is a great gap between the academic world and industry world. Because of this, OPT and its extension is the key to bridge the gap between two world. Therefore, the 24 month extension, in my opinion, is a perfect time for international students to bridge the gap.

3) A few people doubt that more and more international students would make a positive influence to the American society. On the contrary, diversity brought by international students, brings new vigor and vitality into American society. Thus, this proposal is really for the best interest of the whole US as well as the whole world.
