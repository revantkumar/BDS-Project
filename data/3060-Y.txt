I support this STEM by following reasons:

1. The STEM program doesn't reduce the rate of American jobs. Compare to the foreigner students, American has more chance and possibility to get the same position. The reason is that the company will not take the risky of loss the employee after one years training because the status issue. If the American has the same ability to get the same position. I would say he/she will have more chance compare to foreigner student.

Let's analyze why those people say the STEM program robs American jobs.
Compare to the ability, the company want to select the one who can handle this job. (I don't think any company prefer hiring forigner student. All the company will think the profit first.) The ability is the one of the factor to calculate the interviewee.

According to the analysis, the STEM is a filter to filter the people who has the company expecting ability to get the job. Looking back on America history, American becomes the superpower because of acception worldwide the talent people. I can say the STEM gives foreigner students more chance to contribute a little in the related filed.

2. If the STEM was canceled, thousands of foreigner student have to leave the company. Most of forigner student just finished the training. The company will expect the student can bring some value to this company. However, the Cancelation will bring unmeasurable loss to the overall America market.
