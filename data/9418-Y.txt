Hello,

My name is Bing. An Electrical Engineering Graduate student in US. Now, I am working in a hightech company using my first 12 months OPT. My OPT will be expired on Feb. 2016, which means I cannot keep working in United States after Feb. 2016 without STEM degree extension. There are many students who are facing the same problem as I am. The reason for us to stay in US and to work so hard on getting the authorizations to work here is because we'd like to make contributions to this country and to the technology which makes contributions to the mankind. 

As we all known, STEM refers to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. All those fields are the foundations of a country and the foundation of the human's evolution. After 20th century, United States became the representative of advanced technologies. A lot of new technologies were born here and it attracted so many young people who are interested in science and technologies around the world. But, the immigration status is the barrier that those future engineers and scientists should be facing. 

Without the STEM OPT extension policy, more than fifteen thousand STEM students will go back to their countries each year and have no chance to work in United State any more. Based on information of the job marketing in United States, the numbers of technical specialists which are required are more than fifteen thousand each year. Imagine, a lot of startup technology companies will be closed because of no employees and a lot of vacancies will be in many large technology companies because their excellent employees need to go back to their own countries because of their working authorizations are expired. This is not only the lost for those companies but also the lost for the US government. 

Please give a deep thought on the STEM OPT extension policy. It does not only matter for us, but also matters for the country. 

Thank you!
