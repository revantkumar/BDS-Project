I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. US could benefit a lot from those students in the future. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, many famous people who learn things from US and become famous people and have many contributes to the country. They came U.S. as a student and made important contribution to U.S.
