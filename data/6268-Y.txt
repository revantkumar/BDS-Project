I am working under my OPT as a System Analyst in Carmel, Indiana. The company is very excited to know that it is possible STEM OPT extension can be extended to 48 months, because if so, I can keep working and contributing to the company without being worried about my status. If I can no longer work for my current company due to visa issue, they have to look for another person with the qualified education background and knowledgebase. And they also need to get new employee trained and get work and responsibilities transferred. The company needs to take time and efforts to do so. This also going to bring extra work for my department, HR and recruiters.

Our company has collaborations and branches in China. It is necessary for a person who works in my position to speak and communicate in Chinese. International students from China, with computer science knowledge and required working experiences would benefit the company. However it is disappointing for my company to lose an employee because the visa status. H1B is not guaranteed because of the limited cap. If OPT can be extended, international employees would work in a more stable status, and bring benefits and contributions to company.
