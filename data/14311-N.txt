I firmly oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. As an American tech worker I know how hard it is to find employment. I have no issue with competing for jobs with other Americans - I should not have to compete for a job in my country against foreign students and workers.
