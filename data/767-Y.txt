This is fundamentally great policy that will benefit both United States and international students.

As everyone knows, US lead far ahead in technology industry, which relies heavily on international workforces. Extending will attract more international students, who are at very high education level, to contribute to American economy.

We all know that if you see someone becomes rich, it's better to study how he becomes rich, rather than deprive him from the right to earn money. Also when Americans see that international student can earn more through hard work, they will becoming more hard-working, thus improve the compatibility of US.

We can see what roles do international students play in the industry and research institute, and how many of them have become professors and contribute to America. America is America because its open mind, we cannot lose this spirit that makes America the strongest country in the world.

In a word, this proposal is definitely good for both Americans and international students, and will contribute to maintain America's leading position in the world!
