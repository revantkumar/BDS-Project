I do strongly recommend that the new STEM rule will benefit a lot of people including the domestic US worker as well as the foreign student who may contain a STEM situation.
Furthermore, it will also have a huge support on the scientific research and the overall economy of US.
As you know, the US's development of IT in these years shows its strength on the world. We do need a lot of sophisticated worker who can do such a job. But if we close the STEM which will give some opportunity to the foreign students, it will affect the development in some degree and it may also affect the US economy. So the rate of unemployment may also be affected. Otherwise, if we can keep or make the STEM program better, the whole IT or scientific world will benefit a lot. And there will be more and more job opportunities for both domestic and foreign workers.
Overall, based on the merits of all the US workers, STEM is a good choice.
