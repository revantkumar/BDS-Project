As an international graduate, from what I see and experience, I strongly support this proposal. 

OPT program allows foreign students use what their learnt from college to contribute US economy after graduation. And this program will provide more time to foreign students to enhance ability by working in a real American business environment, learning the work ethics and business manner. After OPT, people will go back to their home country. With the experience and knowledge of US, they are most likely to fill in positions that need to do business with US. And it will potentially benefits US economy by expending ocersea's market. 

And to benefit from OPT program is not as easy as many people think. Many restrictions apply, and without satisfying any of them, you need to go. Like 3 months accumulative gap time, job relativness. And many companies don't want to recruit OPT students if they want long term employees. Since there are so many limits, that is a lot more difficult for a foreign student to find a job compared to US citizens. I always think this program is a smart move from US gov to keep most telented people while ensuring there is enough job opportunities for US citizens.

For these reasons, I am really glad to see this proposal will be approved.
