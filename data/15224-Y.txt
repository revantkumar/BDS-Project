I strongly support this rule to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. I am really not good at arguing, so I will just provide fact and simple math here. I am current working in a world-leading comany in science and technology, which has more than 100 years' research and development experience. Our compnay hired a lot of foreign students. They were hired not because they CAN do the jobs, but because the company can not find US citizens with similar expertise. Now let's do the simple math. Now let's assume a foreign student with a STEM PhD degree created value of one million dollar for USA. If this particular guy was forced to leave USA due to the failure of this rule, and say went to another country to look for job and creat one million dollar for that county. Look, this is not about losing on guy, and one million dollar for USA, everything at least doubled. Because you are creating a serious competitor for America, a very serious competitor who has American background and knows this country very well. Therefore, this is truly a rule with VISION and long-term benefits for this great country.
