OPT period is usually used by students to gain some exposure in their interested fields since USA is a country that encourages students to pursue their interests. I don't think there is any necessity to change rules. If you think it's unfair for previous grads, you can atleast not change the 17month extension. 
It would be really nice if you increase the H1B quota instead of ammending these OPT Extention.
