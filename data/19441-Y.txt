Well, from my perspective, international students have made great contributions to our economic prosperity, especially international students major in STEM. STEM is the pillar industry of the economy of the United States, currently some developing country such as China and India is hoping to find their own niches at the advanced technological field, meaning that the United States might face fiercer competition in the future and hardly can us maintain the competitive edge. If this extension can keep some of the elites from these country and let them work for the United States, the society and economy will be benefited as a whole.
