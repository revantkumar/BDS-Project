I am a professor of Carnegie Mellon University, I have seen too many excellent students worrying their legal presence in US, some of them dare not go back to their motherland to see their family after leaving for year just because of the strict limit of the policy. It is so unfair that these well educated and smart young people only have the same chance of getting H1B visa with the illegal immigrants from Mexico. They deserve a much longer OPT period, they will create much more value than the illegal immigrants for US.
