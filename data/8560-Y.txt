Sherry Wan I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many scientists were foreign students before they achieved great achievements. It has benefited U.S. in all areas in the past years. 

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. As most students are seeking the technical jobs that few domestic students are interested and capable at. 

4. The duration of an extension would be set at 24 months, rather than limited to a shorter period, due to the complexity and typical durations of research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields. Affording greater participation in STEM training through changes to the period of the STEM OPT extension would also help the nation and its academic institutions remain competitive in light of global efforts offering international students longer post-study training experience without restrictions on the type of work that may be performed.
