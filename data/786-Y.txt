Changzheng Ma, Northeastern University I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S for economic development. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S because some contributors for our nation such as Pica are international students from abroad by themselves. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many international students have higher ability to fit a good position. Moreover they dont grab the bowl of lower wage. Contrary to this, competition will make our country select better person and enhance average level of all people.
