There are many problems with the proposal.

A reasonable internship would be 2-3 months, not years.

The government statistics show that the USA has literally millions of unemployed and under-employed STEM professionals.

There is no standard, no minimal required skill-level, no attempt to measure skill-levels to indicate whether brighter, more knowledgeable, creative, industrious US citizen candidates exist. And the internship opportunities -- both at US universities and at other employers -- will be put out of reach of the more expensive, i.e. US citizens.

It is consistent, however, with the GHW Bush, Clinton, Shrub and Obummer regimes' desire to render US job markets dysfunctional, make more citizens poorer while driving up living expenses, and generally dragging down the USA all around.
