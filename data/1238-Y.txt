This new change to the regulation is NOT good. There are so many especially young people that cannot get on for those jobs, or are being required to train their replacement who is going to work for less money. That is a terrible thing to have
to do. This country is simply degrading itself as a result of the shenanigans that have come out of the White House. Now 
in addition to that, the inmates are going to be let out of prison and will be trying for jobs especially with the government.
As a retired person, who retired at 75 years of age, having worked since I0 years of age, it is hard to explain how corrupt
this Government has become. We have never seen such corruption, from the top down. We look like a disgrace to everyone around the world, and now to bring in outsiders, who are not known to us, and keep some graduates to fill jobs that would normally be filled by our own graduates or professionals who want to move up. This is a crime against our people !!
