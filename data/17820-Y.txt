I support this proposed rule. United state is based on immigrates! Other then native American, everyone else is an immigrant! There is no "American" "foreigner" here. There are only people "who already immigrated" and people "who want to immigrate to this great country". Instead of welcoming and accommodating all the people came here illegally, who are feeding on the government, isn't it better to welcome skilled and talented people who want to support this country?

Please don't put yourself as an "American" and referring others as "foreigners". If your ancestor didn't immigrate to this country, you are a foreigner right now.........
