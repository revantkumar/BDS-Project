I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 
As we all know, many international students come to America to study engineering and computer science, and if you come to silicon valley, you may see a lot of Asian faces. As a Chinese myself, I can confidently say that Chinese and the other foreigners contribute a lot to the state-of-the-art technology to US, such as semiconductor industry, computer network and so on. Many of them made their great contributions during their opt and opt extension period. Then, with the precious work experience they gained at US, they come back to their home country and could have a much better career than if they don't have work experience in US. This is extremely important to us, we want a better career and a happy life, we want to make contribution to America as much as possible because we got great education here!
