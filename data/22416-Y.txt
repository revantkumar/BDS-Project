I support the STEM OPT extension and do value the contribution it made to US economy.

I am currently working in a computer hardware company located in San Jose, which is a really typical example in Silicon Valley IT industry.Companies hire people equally because of the high potential and value they can contribute to the company and US economy. From my own perspective, my team is expanding. My supervisors and department heads have been concerning not having qualified candidate to fill in positions from the job market.

As many high tech companies facing higher competition in Asian market, I do believe US should find some way to keep high-educated talents especially international talents rather than pushing them and forcing them to work for competitors because of a simple visa issue.
