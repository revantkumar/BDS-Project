1. Blindly extending OPT can endanger national security. Who would benefit from this extension of OPT? Foreign students. Most of them are born and raised in different ideologies than in the U.S. Most of them would pick their native country when it comes to national security, without a heartbeat. Is there a guaranteed reason for them to change their affection through a couple of years of student life? Not very likely. And not for everybody. Why would America unconditionally allow these people to stay and bring uncertainty into national security? Let's not forget what identity some of the 9/11 terrorist entered and stayed in the country. The answer is F1 student visa.

2. Giving away leading position in technology and knowledge. Allowing these foreign students to come and study, then allowing them to gain access to industry, it does no good to America but giving away technology and knowledge. It is not a secret that some foreign government are actively stealing from US firms for technology even without the aid of insiders. Allowing these foreigners to gain more access to the industry would make it even easier for foreign government to steal from the United States. For example, government A could be calling a student who just been hired into a tech firm to either insert a flash drive into a company's database or have his family back in his native country to face hardship. What would the student choose?

3. By giving the opportunities to foreign students, it takes opportunities away from American students. It is a zero sum game in most of the situation. I have heard foreign students complaining about America and alleging allegiance to their native country at the same time. I think it is not fair for Americans.
