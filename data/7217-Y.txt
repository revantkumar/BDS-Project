I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule. I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.
The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates. US needs a larger tech-savvy workforce to maximize economic growth. Moreover, US Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months. Most of the US Universities and colleges will shutting their doors if the OPT extension is not given, because student will choose other countries for higher education
With this comment, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.
