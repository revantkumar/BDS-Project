Tim Jennings I STRONGLY SUPPORT the extension. I think if we close this door. All these international graduates with outstanding skills will leave us. Our companies will not be able to get enough qualified workers. What's more, there will be less international students coming to our schools. As a result, less tourism income, less sales income, less education income. Our economy will be affected in all aspects.
