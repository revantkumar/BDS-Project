Zhe Chen I definitely support the proposed rule. I have read some of the comments saying that the STEM extension will rob jobs from the US people, but it is NOT true at all ! 
First, students using STEM extension only occupies a very small percentage of the employment. 
Second, it is important for the US government to ensure the diversity of the employment, and we students are a small group of people that can help with the diversity of STEM related companies. It is commonly known that diversity of a very important property for a company to develop healthily. 
Finally, students using STEM extension to work in the american company get the same pay as US people and we students pay the same tax as US people.
