I support the extension of opt by 24 months for F1 students. It will benefit not only those students themselves but also the whole country (the U.S.).

Longer OPT makes more profit for most of companies. Those students make the market of human resource richer and more competitive. Hiring more talented and skillful people does benefit companies and even the whole society, right?

It cost the universities and the country much to educate those brilliant students even though students have paid their tuitions. And after that you just let them go? They get educated for better servicing the society. Let them shine and improve our society!

America is a great country not only because of her advanced technology and law system but also because of the equal and liberal environment she provides for everyone to develop. Give those students a chance and give the country a chance!
