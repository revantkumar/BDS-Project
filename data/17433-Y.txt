I strongly support the extension of OPT to be as long as 24 years. As the greatest immigration country in the world, U.S. is powered by talents from every corner of the world through its eduction system. After graduated with M.S./Ph.D degrees, most of them seek to stay in the America to serve the country which gives them the opportunities that other countries. Currently H1B is under the fixed quota, which means not of all applicants can get the working visa at once, OPT is the only chance for them to stay in U.S. Remember, all the students benefits the OPT policy are from the formal education system. They will be part of the backbone of the country.
