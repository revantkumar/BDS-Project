Here's an original idea: Why don't we educate our own Children so they can get a job? And not just a part time job that 
ObamaCare sites? We don't have enough jobs for the legal citizens that were actually born here. Why don't we stop taxing our companies to death forcing them to go overseas. This administration is wreaking our country. They give and what does our Congress do;They give Obama full reign to spend as much money as he wants. And believe me he wants to spend alot of 
money on his immigration policies.
It's not just Obama. When Bushll was in office, he said in a speech: You don't want your kids working in a factory. Where in the hell are they supposed to work? Maybe we need a Donald Trump that can actually make good deals for us instead of trying to lift every other country in the world up while our country gets weaker.
