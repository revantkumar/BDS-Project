I strongly support this proposed rule because it will greatly benefit not only American economy but also attracts the best talents to American education institutions and that will help those schools/universities stay at a good position academically and in research areas. 

There are not enough stem workers in America today and big name companies like Facebook, Google and Linked in will need international students to work for them and sponsor them for H1B work visa. We shouldn't worry about depriving american workers of the jobs because both americans and internationals stand an equal chance in getting the job, because companies won't pay less to hire an international worker. In fact companies even need to pay more to hire an international students because of the sponsorship fees (H1B application, green card application..etc) so they are more incentivized to hire american workers.
