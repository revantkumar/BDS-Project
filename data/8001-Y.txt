Shuang Li More training opportunity for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degree will not influence the employment of US citizens.Instead, those students could play important roles thrusting scientific and technological development of the United States. First, students with OPT are at the entry-level employment or even taking internships in industry/research institution. They will not influence for the recruitment of mainstay for the company/institution. Moreover, majority of OPT students are at their early 20s, and their OPT training enables them to integrate various fields of science and technology. They are the ones that have the strongest creativity and therefore biggest potential to promote the development of science and technology. Last but not least, various counties now pay special attention to the recruiting of those highly educated students. Therefore, there is a smaller and smaller chance that those students will permanently stay in the US and influence the employment of US citizens in the future. Therefore, I support that F-1 non-immigrant student been given longer training periods.
