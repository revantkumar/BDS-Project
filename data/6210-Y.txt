I fully support the rule to keep and extend OPT for STEM students.

A lot of US workers believe STEM students are taking their jobs away. In fact, STEM students are contributing to US using their talents and efforts that most US workers cannot offer! 

There are a lot of positions that need candidates with advanced degrees and skills. They need someone who can solve difficult problems, write complicated computer programs, compute sophisticated equations, design advanced products or even access to toxic chemicals. However, only a small amount of US workers can handles them and that is why companies want to hire excellent STEM students who are capable of doing these jobs!

US needs these STEM students to utilize their talents and skills.
