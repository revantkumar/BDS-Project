In my opinion, the STEM program not only benefits international workers but also the businesses in which they could employ experienced and skilled workers for a less demanding salary. Extending the STEM program would allow the international workers to have a better chance in getting a working visa and businesses to have qualified employers for a extended period of time. Hence, improving the economy by allowing talented workers to contribute to the country. In addition, it will also add to the diversity of races and ethnicity in companies promoting diversities.
