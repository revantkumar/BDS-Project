I'm against expanding the OPT program. American workers deserve to be supported by America instead of hurt. Information from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed that OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013 and removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare funds. This hurts American workers, both current and retired.

OPT workers are preferred by employers because they are often younger and cheaper to hire than American workers who may have more experience. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs paying $60-90,000 per year and cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars every year. To quote Senator Charles Grassley, "OPT is meant to be a temporary training program, not as a bridge to a longer-term work visa or a way for employers to hire cheaper foreign labor in lieu of Americans."

America should offer training and employment to American workers instead of training and employing foreign students at the expense of Americans and the American workforce.
