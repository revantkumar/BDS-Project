I strongly SOPPORT the OPT extension.

Over the years, international students have greatly contributed to the development of technology and economy of the United States. They bring innovations. They join in groups in Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and give us surprises. We have no reason to keep them out of the country.

It is ridiculous that we should prevent international students from working in the United States in order to give permanent residents more job opportunities. That is unfair. The competition may exist, but it is great for both students to learn and improve! All men are equal to have rights to compete for a job using their own abilities!
