Dong Dong As a international student major in financial engineering, honestly speaking, more than 90% of students in our major are from abroad. I do believe there are high ratio of international students in other graduate programs. I spend more than 60 thousands dollars each year here and also want to get 2 more years experience. I have no idea why some people ignore our contribution to this country. I would never decide to study here if I know I'm not welcome here.
