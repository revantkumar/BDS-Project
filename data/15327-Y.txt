I agree with this proposal as this can benefit a lot for the F1 students who are pursuing advance study in the area of their choice. Studying in school only helps a portion of learning but OPT is the other portion which is critical for completing the learning process. In addition, only 12 months of OPT is not long enough for really help students master what they learn in school. So this proposal is really helpful on that too.
