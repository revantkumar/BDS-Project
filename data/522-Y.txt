sai shankar kaki I strongly support 24 months STEM OPT extension. This extension could greatly help international students like us who came to pursing STEM Degrees in United States by spending thousands of dollars. We all come here with hope to learn, achieve something and work to gain practical knowledge from what we have learnt here and get an international exposure. This could also give young talent and creativity to this land of opportunity. So far there many young talents from all over the world are showing up keen interest to study, showcase their talent in USA. For all this to happen in an appropriate way, each and every student need to get at least some good time to learn and showcase their talent here. In recent here years increase in F1 students increased greatly, If this extension is cancelledm large number of students will be effected and employers will loose the large of resources. Hope this nation and government never step back in helping the young talent.
