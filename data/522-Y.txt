I strongly support the extension of STEM OPT and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't hurt anyone. 
Most of the STEM jobs not only efficiently create fortune that benefit U.S. but also push the society to a better version. We all know that it's the right thing to do for the country, collecting the best human resource in global level, and we all see no good in the history of local protectionism.
