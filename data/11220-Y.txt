The international students are major forces in science and engineering graduate school. Check out how many scientific research papers published by international students. They are fighting to keep America's leading research and technology advantages. By extending the stem opt, students can look for more opportunities to improve themselves as well as America's technology field. Some US citizens just concern about the jobs taken by stem graduates, but they should try to improve their own skills and knowledge rather than kicking these better guys out, if they are all kicked out, these guys can get the jobs but the technology development will be deteriorated. The advantages will be transferred to China, India...... The international students also looking for opportunities besides education. If they should just go back after graduation, then the United States will not be the first choice for most of them, that is also harmful to the higher education system. So the stem extension is pretty good for America to keep the most energy as a leader in the world.
