To my understanding, employers typically pay more for hiring a foreign worker. They need to pay extra money to lawyers for visa filing and application. Plus they need to pay a lot of fees to DHS for processing. After that, to keep the working authorization for the employee even more legal work are needed for the lengthy and tedious immigration process. The average wages employers pay to these foreign workers are actually higher. Despite all the troubles and hassles, what makes the employers more willing to hire foreign workers are due to the simple fact that they are more skillful and effective at some specific fields like STEM. Eventually these employees end up paying more taxes and contributing more to the US. The worlds are becoming more and more connected nowadays. Most other countries have proposed similar policy to make them more appealing to people with distinguished expertise. It's crucial for the US to take actions to compete for these people in order to keep a leading position in the global economy.
