I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Science and Technology is of great importance for US economy. Although there is only 5% employee in this field, they are responsible for about 50% US economic growth. Why so many people does not choose this field? Because it is a tough field. It is a field that needs a lot of time on working hard. While others enjoy sunny weather outside, we have to stay in the lab working hard. While others travel to worldwide, we have to stay in labs all the time. While others have their crazy weekend and screening for a football game, we are working in the lab and repeat our experiments. In addition, it is rather challenging to get a degree in this field. That's why many students changes their major even they chose this field in the beginning of their college. For international students, it is even harder because we are in very disadvantage position in finding a job even after graduation. Worst of all, we have to rely on luck to get a H1B visa to legally stay in this country, and this luck is only 20% chance each year because many ICC companies illegally occupy multiple H1B positions for their non-US customers. 
Nowadays, more and more international student begin to choose other countries instead of US because the life there is much easier. I think US government should action now. They should create a better environment for Science and Technology students, and encourage them coming here and working here, because those hardworking students sacrifice all of their youth and life to improve the economy here and create a better society for this country.
