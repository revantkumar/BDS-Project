I strongly support this new proposal regarding the expanding training opportunities for F-1 students. 

As a F-1 student with a STEM degree, I would like to use my knowledge which was obtained from my university in US to contribute to the US economic growth. With a PhD degree, I have that kind of knowledge and research experience which are needed in many companies in US. It is beneficial not only to the company who hires me but also to the whole society if more students like me are hired and stay in the US for nonimmigrant purpose. This new regulation proposal is critical for us to stay in the US and to contribute to both the diversity and economy of US. 

The whole world has been driven by knowledge and innovation for a long time. This trend will be strengthened in the future due to the continuing transition of global economic growth from labor driven to innovation driven. Professionals with innovative mind will be the most valuable asset to every country in the world. This regulation proposal, if passed, is a catalyst to the economic growth of US.
