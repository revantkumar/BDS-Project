I totally support this act.

OPT keeps the education system in US attractive to intelligent students around the world. I am a student in China, and in my university or even in all the top universities in China, there is a rumor that the first-class students will go to US to finish their further study, the second-class students will finish the graduate career in China, and the last-class students just graduate and find some jobs. It's clear that the people with great talents are studying in US, which benefits US in many ways. Without them, I think within the next 2 decades, China can lead the world replacing US, and that is certainly not the result US government or citizens want to see.

To the opponents, there should not be so much concern on the unemployment which is led by international students. Because this act require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated US workers.

Besides I really want to do something for US. If US government doesn't give me a chance, I have to stay in China, that will be a loss to both US and me.
