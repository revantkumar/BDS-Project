I resent use of taxpayer funds to educate non-citizens. We have thousands of engineering, medical, and science students who are barely scraping by, despite the fact that they are citizens. My own son, who for a time worked for the U.S. Army in cooperation with DHS, is drowning in debt despite the fact that he was an honor student.

This program should be killed. Period.
