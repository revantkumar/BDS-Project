As we all know the H1B VISA attracts lots of intelligent workforce from all over the world. This contributes significantly to the economic and scientific development of US. OPT extension opens the gate for intelligent students to acquire H1B VISA and thus work in the US. If the extension is revoked, students may back up and decide to work elsewhere. This way US will lose lots of intelligence and these intelligent students would work for other countries which will in term hamper US's economical development. Indeed the OPT extension would rise the competition of jobs. I do not think it would really hurt US's citizens' job opportunities. On the contrary, this would encourage US citizens to obtain high degree of education and generate more highly educated workforce. To conclude, I am definitely in favor of this extension.
