Willie Wenger International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. International students also help promote a global learning environment. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity.
