Dirk Trumic I highly SUPPORT the OPT STEM extension regulation. As a US citizen, I think this regulation does benefit our country a lot. And I don't think it will do any harm for US citizen, especially in the labor market. The unemployment rate in the US drops from 10% to 5% from 2010 until now. The OPT STEM extension was first announced in 2008. So the data clearly indicates that the regulation didn't have any bad impact on the US citizen employment opportunity, rather, it created more job opportunities in the US. More and more US citizen got hired after 2010.

The 24 month OPT STEM extension is a very good news for US education system. It will attract more smart international students to come to US for their college or higher degree education. Because after their graduation, they will have the opportunity to practice their knowledge in US, which is beneficial for their career. The US colleges can make a lot money from international students since their usually charge them much higher tuition. After those international students come to US for their study, they need to rent apartments, buy food, get cars, which will also increase the income for local.

After those F-1 nonimmigrant student graduate from college and start their work in the US, they still make contribution for USA. If they can stay in the US for another 24 month, they can make more contribution. They create valuable products for US company. They make more consumption in the US. They help increase US economy.

So please approve the OPT STEM extension regulation. It will give a lot of credits to US society.
