I fully support the proposed OPT extension program. As an software engineer of one of the top tech companies in the country, I am in a position to provide some facts to support the proposal. 
In the organization I am working with, we develop and operate very complicated software systems. It took years of efforts of many talented people to achieve what we have today, and it will require more and more efforts to improve, to evolve. For systems like that, it generally take a year of a developer with decent skill sets to be able to get meaningful insights and start to make constructive contributes. It is not hard to imagine how important it is to have stable staff, and how it would be impossible without a policy to keep those who benefits from OPT extension programs for long enough. In our organization on average 2 out of 7 team members benefit from the OPT program, it would be a big loss if we lose them when they can start to make real impacts.
People might argue that we can hire just citizens and permanent residents. Like many tech companies, our hiring decision are made by a group of interviewers. We treat each candidate equally, knowledge, experience, potentials and leadership are our only standards. The fact that nearly one third of our team members benefit from OPT program indicates that they are a significant source of talent, and losing that source is definitely a loss to the company, to the industry, to our competitiveness to our competitors worldwide.
