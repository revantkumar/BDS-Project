I definitely support this new rule. It has lot more positives than negatives. Here are some of my thoughts and requests. 
1) This rule should benefit only those who do the training/internship in the same/relative field of study as in their school. 
2) This would be useful for a lot of students who do the training/internship for a whole year (who are forced to skip their first chance at H1B) while they still get 2 more chances (everyone deserves minimum 2 chances). 
Two of my co-workers had to be let go only because their visa applications weren't picked in the lottery.
3) There needs to be strict restrictions on OPT extension for those who try to switch to an IT consultancy from their field of study. Because I know of a lot of people who have done and land with a job before those who really deserve it.
4) Finally, I strongly disagree with the notion that international students are stealing american jobs. 
According to my experience, I had seen lots and lots of jobs which are strictly for US citizens only. And if not, there are many companies who still hesitate to provide H1B sponsorship. 
Hence, personally I think that this new rule would be very useful for both the companies, and the students.
