I strongly support the 24-month STEM OPT extension rule. US companies will not benefit from just spending one year to train the STEM graduates and send them back to their own countries. After training, the STEM graduates are expected to practice the skills they learn in the way of conducting projects. 24-month extension is an appropriate time window for STEM students gaining enough industry experience and producing corresponding profit for US companies. And STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident and instead it will create job opportunities.
