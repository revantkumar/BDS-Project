I am a Chinese student studying in the United States. The 24 extension for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees is really essential. Personally, I have been in the United States for over 3 years. I can tell within these years, my communication, analytics, critical thinking skills are hugely improved. Now, I am a senior and about to graduate with Computer Information Systems degree. I want to apply my knowledge in the work field and contribute to the growth of U.S Economy. Thank for the opportunity to let F-1 Visa students to stay in U.S and apply for jobs. Now, I am asking the government to extend the OPT Period to 36 months. I believe that this will give F-1 Visa students enough time to land a job after graduation. I also strongly believe this is a good chance to pick up those elites in the industry and continuously contribute to the growth of U.S economy.
