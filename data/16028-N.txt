Why is this current administration continuing down its' 7 year path of destruction for America?!?! I honestly can not understand why they would take more jobs away from an already depressed economy and hand them over, gift wrapped, to foreigners! Can you imagine ANY other country in the world sabotaging their own like Obama has done?! NO! The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
