This is very good to the court's decision. I feel that this gives opportunity to the people outside United States not only get quality education, but also work for quality organizations and gain expertise before going back to their home country. 

The 36 month period (including extension) would give the students apply the education they have received from the best universities in the world. 

The mentoring should be really useful to the students and should evolve them to be much better professionals in whatever field they are good at. 

I hope that this will be effective in the near term and help students of other countries benefit and also in turn benefit the United States.

Thanks!
