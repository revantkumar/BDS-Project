Everyone knows U.S Society means liberaty, security of human rights and opportunity without bias. 

I Strongly support this porposal for the following reasons:
1.It is worthy and profound to provide appropriate opportunities for international students with good knowledge and skills to contribute to U.S Society.

2.Diversity is very important for U.S, many people from other countries such as Musk or Einstein make great contributions to America or even the whole world, which have significant influences around the world. 

3.With many hardworking and positive international students, competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing, keeping society environment competitive encourages a impartial and sustainable society.

4. Many international students in U.S do not waste the welfare resource in U.S they are producible.
