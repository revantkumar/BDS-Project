The best thing about the opt extension is to help America. we know America is a larger migration country, all the opt extension positions are for the engineers or science major students. They are working on most of the difficult and high level technical jobs. America need those people, they got the education here, if we do not use them, we are wasting the money to educate them. If we do not use them, we are wasting a lot of talented people. Those opt extension holders they have already checked background by USCIS,they do not have issue with any illegal immigrates and most of them get very good education in US college, if we lost them, we will lost a bunch of talents. 
Think about this, and think about the future of America.
