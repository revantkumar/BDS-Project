I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

I studied really hard since I was young, I am always the top student in the class. I came to the u.s. since my dream company is here. So I studied harder and harder. I presented with my high score, and passed all the test to study here. After 2 year of master study, I finally joined my dream company. I believe I did a great job at my work, just like how I studied hard in school.

But now... I might need to leave soon...

People who study hard and work hard is going to contribute to the society, they are not competing with low salary, but all those years of hard working. New job opportunities might be created when more elite with high tech knowledge is contributing to this society.
