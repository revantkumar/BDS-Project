As a prospective STEM student at the University of Virginia, I know firsthand that careers in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) allow individuals, especially recent college graduates, to play an active role in developing cutting-edge technologies and innovations. However, many researchers and experts contend that in the coming years, the United States will face the "STEM paradox": while graduates pursuing STEM degrees are increasing, so are the number of unfilled STEM positions. With this dearth of STEM-related expertise in the United States, I believe that modifying and expanding the OPT extension period provides immense benefits for the United States and its interests in the long-term. 

One primary area of concern regarding the OPT extension is the 17 or 24-month extension period. I believe that the 24-month extension is appropriate for the OPT program, as it makes the United States competitive with the programs of other nations while ensuring that the OPT program is not a permanent, long-term solution for employment. There is certainly a need to attract talented international students to United States universities, especially as other nations around the world are vying to appeal to the same cohort of students. Canada, for example, offers a three-year practical training program, and the 24-month extension would make the United States' offerings comparable to those of Canada and other competing nations. 

Likewise, a 24-month extension, coupled with the existing 12-month OPT program, would ensure that this program is not a long-term solution to gain employment, but rather an opportunity for a graduate to hone practical, job-related skills. While I believe a 24-month extension is appropriate, I question whether this extension serves as a substitute for the H-1B non-immigrant visa. The H-1B allows for employment for specialty occupations, including STEM, architecture, business, law, and the arts for up to six years, and expanding the H-
