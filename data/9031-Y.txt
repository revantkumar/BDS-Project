I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It's very important for U.S to attract great immigrants from all over the world to build a better country and better world. Without immigrants, there would be no U.S.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, it's why U.S is a great country.

3. The STEM students are not actually taking jobs away from U.S citizens, they are filling this tech industry that has a large amount of need but it can't be fufilled by U.S citizens.
