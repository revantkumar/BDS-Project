I see that people who object this rule mainly blaming the OPT students for the fact that there are other jobless American waiting to be hired. However, this is very misleading and superficial conclusion. OPT students are highly educated with the most up-to-date skills and technology. I dont believe that the OPT students are a direct competition to the jobless American as they are not looking for the same category of jobs. Lots of American lost their jobs because of manufacturing outsourcing. The U.S. job market is a free market. I believe that free and fair competition is also the core of American spirit. Whoever gets hired must be a very good candidate, if not the best. Hiring qualified people for the job instead of hiring someone for the job simply because he is American definitely improves overall efficiency for the economy, thus producing more jobs for the Americans.
