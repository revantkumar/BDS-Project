I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of expanding OPT for F1 students. 

Tech companies need STEM students to work for them. And diversity is an important factor in their cultures. Those students make contributions in their universities and they will continue contributing in those companies and thus contribute to U.S. economy and society. 

They obey laws - data shows very few of F1 students violate laws compared to the rate of U.S citizens. It's safe for our society to welcome them. 

Competitions do exist while we have more STEM students staying in the U.S. for longer period of time. But this is what makes our economy and technology better. U.S. embraces people from different countries and various cultures. This is what make us strong. 

We should definitely expand OPT!
