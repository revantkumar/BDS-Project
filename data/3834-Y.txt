I strongly support the regulation. As everyone knows, academic usually takes long time a long way. Most of the researches need 2 to 3 years. Without this regulations, international students will have to leave the country in 17 months which means that they will leave their work half-done. I am a student from CS department. My last project related to AI took 2 years and one month. I finished the project using the OPT extension. If students leave their work half-done, colleges and universities will need to train others again to take over their work, which is a great waste of human resource and money.
