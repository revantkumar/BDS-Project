President Obama keeps talking about raising the minimum wage but is doing everything he can to make sure good jobs go to foreign nationals. I really do not know who's side our government is on? They talk about jobs for Americans and higher wages but allow foreign workers to overflow our industries thus lowering our wages? Do the Democrats even understand supply and demand? An excess supply will lower price! Don't cry about businesses paying smaller wages if you help flood the market with cheap foreign labor!
