I strongly support the extension of OPT.The main purpose of OPT is to help U.S. acadamic sector remain competitive all around the world, and the OPT is just a mean to achieve this goal.
I just graduated from Syracuse University, the reason for me to pursue a better education in U.S. is the existence of OPT, where I have chance to improve both my knowledge and practical skills as an engineer. Nowadays, more and more young students are seeking for a chance to study abroad, without the policy of OPT, European schools may even be more attractive than those in U.S..
As a matter of fact, OPT not only improve American technical field, but also help the growth in economy. Supermarkets of different countries are built, places of entertainment of different cultures are open, even more and more tourists are attracted to U.S.. Native american people have more choices in finding a place to shop, to eat and to have fun.
I just got my job here in U.S., as far as I know, the project in our team need at least 2 years. My company has promised to keep me here, at least to finish the project. So companies also have a need for international students.
