I strongly support this proposal of expanding OPT for 24 months for STEM students.
I am a pursuing a STEM master degree in business intelligence and data analysis. By reviewing the latest research data, there are 4 millions computer jobs in demand while there are only 40,000 CS Bachelors in supply. Thus there is a huge shortage on STEM talent in US.

STEM jobs require solid experiences. OPT is a good chance for STEM students to gain industrial experiences. That why international student would like to come to US to pursue a degree instead of go to UK, Canada or Australia. Thanks to OPT, both US education organizations and international students get Win-Win.

Moreover, projects in STEM related works often last for years, a two-year extension is needed to help to US companies to reach their goals with the help of international STEM students.
