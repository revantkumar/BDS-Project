OPT is an opportunity for international students to contribute to US industry by sharing what they learned in US, rather than getting knowledge back to their own countries directory. OPT not only benefits international students, but also benefits US industry. I would say OPT benefits US more. Many excellent students graduate every year, and they find jobs at US. If they could not get a H1B visa, then they have to leave US and move to another country. The thing should be noticed here is that they already get trained for one year when they do OPT (as you know, the first year of the new graduates is more like a training rather than contribution), and they are ready to do contribution to US. However, if they have to leave, they could not contribute to US, which means US lose many skilled engineers/workers to other countries after training them. It is a great lost to US. 

When we consider if the OPT extension affect local people's job market, I would say NO. Companies always hire the best candidate available to them, so only excellent international students can find a job at US. It means only best students can have a chance to leave in US, and further to get H1B visa. Therefore, OPT is a good filter to select best international students. US already filtered only best students, and trained them, why don't give them an OPT extension and let them have more chances to get H1B visa and contribute to US more?
