DHS mission statement in part...
The Department of Homeland Security has a vital mission: to secure the nation from the many threats we face. ... -keeping America safe. 

Why should DHS be writing a proposal to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT). 
Their expertise is supposed to be in "Security". ....and, if OPT is in the bailiwick of DHS, how will expanding OPT help "secure the nation from the many threats"? How will this help with their goal of "keeping America safe"?

This proposed OPT expansion could have the exact opposite effect and make America less safe. Screening of foreign students, immigrants, refugees, foreign visitors, etc. is not an exact science. Allowing more to enter or stay once they have entered increases the odds of DHS failing, hence making America LESS safe.

The work being done by OPT non-immigrants would otherwise be done by either residents of the U.S. or H-1B workers; members of both groups pay FICA and Medicare taxes. OPT workers, like others on F-1 visas, pay no such taxes. Our nation is already 18 trillion dollars in the red. Why would we want to remove taxpayers to employ non-taxpayers? Makes no sense!! 

This proposal also seems to give employers financial incentives to hire foreigner over Americans. These people will work for less money, always a good thing for the boss.

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
