Cong Cui I strongly support this proposed rule. 

I have heard the stories from both sides. Not sure who is absolutely right, if there exists one. Allowing more highly educated immigrants work in US has its pros and cons for US citizens. But one thing for sure is that Russia, China and India are all trying their best to attract their Masters and Ph.Ds to go back to their own countries. btw, their educations are paid by US tax payers.
