Hang Li I am strongly support the expanding of OPT opportunities, for following reasons:

1. The United State need people from all over the world to help this country, especially for those in STEM major. we can clearly see that people work in the STEM field, are mostly from other countries. there are only 2 reason for that: local people don't like to work in STEM area, or local people don't have the ability to finish the job nicely like people from other countries does. so we need to give those people from other countries more chance, so that they can work for this country.

2. The United State is a country of immigrations. The only way to keep this country developing is to accept more skilled people whom willing to work here and help the country. For those people against the extending of OPT, they probably just thinking of themselves. Yes, those people from other countries get a job here and you as a citizen don't have a job with that salary, but have you ever think the reason you don't have a nice job? is because you don't work hard as the other people in that position, you don't work as good as that person in that position, and you don't help the country as much as the other person do. The new immigrations help to make the United State better, they spend hundred thousands of dollars here for their education, and they will help this country, especially in high tech area. if there is no OPT, there will be much less people willing to study here, and work here, the high tech industry will disappear and country will die within few decades.

3. it is by law that the United State will accept immigrations. for those against the OPT, you may be a citizen here, but 100 years ago, your ancestors are all from other countries, you are the children of immigrations, why you against it when yourself also a part of it.
