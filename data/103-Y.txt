I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I was an international student majored in STEM in 2012. One of the reason I chose to pursue my degree in US, other than UK, Canada or Singapore was that the US provide industrial training opportunity after graduation. I believe this also was true for a large amount of international students. From my previous experience, the OPT extension rule makes this opportunity especially more meaningful as a lot research/development projects need more than 2 years to finish. This is really helpful to international students to advance their careers. Without OPT extension rule, I can't imagine how US can maintain its attractiveness to international students. Both international students and academic sectors will benefit from the rules. In addition, the international students also made significant contributions to the US. For example, they pay tuition and some other living expenses, which eventually would contribute to the US economy.
