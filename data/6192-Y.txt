I strongly support the OPT program should be prolonged. 
1. The OPT program is closely related to the U.S IT industry institutes. As there are so many people graduate from universities and seek jobs in the IT industry. And IT companies need STEM graduates deeply. If the OPT program is prolonged, I am sure that the companies will benefit from it a lot.
2. As a international student, I plan to continue my study in US in the next year, and I hope I will have more time and experience working in the U.S IT companies when I graduate from the university.
