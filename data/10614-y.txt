Jack Z. For my understand, this is a good policy for all F-1 students who really want to work hard and get more experience. I saw many talented F-1 engineers gave up everything here and back to their own countries due to H1B issue. For me, I am also in F-1 OPT extension. I like work with my teams here in Indianapolis, IN. We have a big project here with other company, my OPT will be end at Dec.2016, so currently they do not assign long-term tasks on engineers like me in case we have to leave next year. 
Extra 7 month is always good for work experience and our projects. Thus in the future for other international students, they will be able to move around different companies to obtain more knowledge. Some company does not want to provide training for students with short OPT.
Also, it will be slightly better for us F-1 students to obtain H1B VISA since we could have 3 chances in H1B lottery. Many people from a country fill 5-10 H1B applications and get all H1Bs. Whereas good, hard working and creative students cannot get H1B and have to give up everything we build in the past few years. See Redbus2us... many of those people are low skill but get H1B.
In addition, this policy can help improving American economy. For example, dealer refused to lease car to me since my OPT has 17 months left. If I can have 24 months OPT to show to dealers, they will be glad to let me sign the lease. It helped industry growth, local business, and keep money in America. Win-Win. 

Thus I have to say this is a good policy, thank you USCIS! And please make more policy to prevent people filling multiple H1B by those fake consulting companies like these:
