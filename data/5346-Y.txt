Yao Chen I strongly support the rule of OPT extension to 24 months. It benefits both United State economic and attracts more talented foreign students to study in US.

First, as far as we notice that the recent years, the United States economy bloomed and will continue blooming because of those STEM people's contributions. For a long period of time, the development of United States rely on people come from other nations. Without them, the economic will be influenced. Imagine that one day those companies start to lose people, it will directly lead to a result of impact of leading position that most US companies have today. 

Second, United States is a country of variety people. Each person came to US with their specific culture and idea contribute to the US society. Since creativity is the most important to most area of business. Extending the OPT can maintain and increase the variety of population, especially it will help to keep those who are better educated people continuing contributing to this country. 

Third, STEM majors are those "hard" major. It requires a lot of efforts to put into those fields of study. Therefore, students in STEM major are the smartest people all over the world. If OPT extension will be 24 months or even longer, then students will be more willing to study in universities of United States and try to find a job later. More research can be done by the brightest students. It will benefit universities and education institutions with less expenses. 

Overall, the extension of OPT to 24 month will benefits United States a lot. I highly support it.
