Jiang Xue As a STEM major graduate from China, I would say one of the reasons that why I chose America as the place I go for further study is to take use of the OPT and its extension to gain some hands-on experience. Living and studying here for the past two years, I have talked with lots of international students. A lot of them share the same reasoning with me regarding coming abroad for education. The new rule is definitely meeting the needs of most of the foreign students. I am being very thankful to be able to see this new rule being proposed and getting a chance to go through. Because I believe it's going to benefit so many foreign students and lots of companies here in the states. I would love to see this win-win situation happen finally.
