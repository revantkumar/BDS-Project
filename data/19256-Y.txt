I am a stem student at a well-known science and technology school at new England region. In campus, I can see a lot of international students like me. They actively participate in research, course discussion. They work as Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant and contribute to the university a lot. 
I cannot imagine that this group of students has to live a life full of risk once they obtain the degree. It's specially unequal and unfair after they use all their talents, time and efforts to help to develop a county that they will in the end abort them.
I believe a lot of students never intend to stay in the States for the rest of the life. For example for some one-year program of economy related major, they just want to go back to their country and find a job. But for some STEM students, things are different. They have talent and ambition to do something big. They may want to build robot or astrocraft. They may want to develop an algorithm to optimize the traffic. But they can only do it here. If they are sent back to their homeland, they may even do not have enough to eat. That's a waste of their talent.
Besides, look back to the history of USA. There are countless people who achieve great things but are not born to be a US citizen. The reason why US is the leading country in the world is that they are the most welcome country to genius, compared with any other country in the world.
It the government of US want to keep your country to keep the best in the world, do not let your resource to be wasted. Do not let the student you spend money and time to cultivate to live a life but never where to go tomorrow.
