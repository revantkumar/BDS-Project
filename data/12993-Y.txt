I totally agree with the OPT rule and its extension. 

Contrary to popular myth, student with OPT do not push Americans stem students out of jobs. They tend to fill jobs that Americans cannot or will not fill, mostly at the high ends of the skill spectrum. OPT student are disproportionately represented in such high-skilled fields as medicine, physics and computer science. 

They work for us, contribute their money and life to our development. Why would we banish them out? 

why could we improve our education system to enable our people to fit those high-skilled fields jobs? 

we could not blame for them !
