As a US citizen, I strongly support this proposal since this is a win-win situation for both the US and the international students. Here are 2 reason.

1. International students in a STEM major make big improvement in technological and economic development of the U.S. As an example, the IT companies made billions of profit and benefits everyone in this country. Thousands of international employees in these companies contribute this big thrive and progress. So in order for the future economy, we should allow those STEM students work longer in the US. 

2. Some argue saying that international students create intense competition for jobs in the U.S. However, the fact is that the US only issues about tens of thousand OPT visa every year. As you can imagine how big the job market it is, there is no big impact from these international students. And the international employees also pay the federal as well as state tax to improve the live for US people.

So, I strongly agree with the OPT extension proposal.
