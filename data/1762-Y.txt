Why do GOVT always give these STEM job positions to foreigner? They took the education opportunities from citizens and now they have 3 years to take job positions.I'm not a racist ,but I think 1 year long OPT is fair enough.What we need is top students ,not the "fine" students who need 3 years to find a job offering VISA.For other job positions ,the citizens who take STEM courses and degree can be competent at these jobs better.
