Qingyuan Lin I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. Everyone is born to be equal. We should give the STEM students studying in US equal right to look for a job, but the visa problem is stopping them to have such right.

2. STEM students can make great contribution to US economy, with such extension we can attract more talented students to stay in the US and contribute to the economy.

3. US universities spent lots of resources to train these STEM students, it does not make any sense to not allow them to contribute to the US society after their training.
