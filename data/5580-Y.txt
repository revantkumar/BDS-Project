I think this expansion is necessary from the perspective view of U.S. economy. 
These students are of high education and have acquired strong skills in their domain. They will contribute a lot to high-tech industries and researches facilities in fields of IT, bio, chem, material science. I cannot image the how big the loss is to the U.S. whole economy if Sundar Pichai(Google CEO), Qi Lu(Microsoft Vice President), Satya Nadella(Microsoft CEO) were forced to leave due to OPT expiration.
