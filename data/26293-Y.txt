I support OPT extension rule. The negative comments here have a common misunderstanding: I cannot find a job because there are a lot of foreigners. Well, this already implies that STEM foreigners are so important to US because they are way better and cannot be replaced. Wake up, they are not stealing jobs from you, they are creating jobs for you.

In fact STEM graduates strengthen America's technology, boost America's economy and create more job opportunities for Americans. Without their contribution, the job markets will shrink severely in America. In the long run, America's leading role in economy and technology will disappear, and as a result even less job opportunities then. Some people here, however, hope America to sacrifice heavily to lose a huge number of well-educated and creative talents. Come on, why don't you try work harder? Business owners are not fool, they will not hire people who are not eager to improve themselves but only conspire against others.
