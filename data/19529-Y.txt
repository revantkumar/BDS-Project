From any perspective, I would like to strongly support this extension rule for the following reasons: 

Firstly of all, people all over the world know that American spirit is to give everyone an equal chance and human beings' freedom is the most important right for people. In this point of view, we need to admit that every talented students who come to US to study deserve a chance to be staying in USA to make efforts in his career path. No only our American students, but also international students deserve more time to practice their skills after graduation. Why we emphasis human rights and freedom all the time, but we don't want to provide chances to other foreign students equal opportunities to work together.

Secondly, I fully agree that OPT extension method will do good for US economy as lots of talented foreign people will especially work in IT and Engineering industries, which is the major force for any nation to be much stronger from any fields.

Last but not the least, OPT will also attract more international students to come to USA for further education. That will not only bring more incoming to the USA, but also do good for international culture communications between USA and other countries.

So why don't we approve this two-win rule in Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students? I don't understand many of the the ridiculous opinions in objecting this. Please calm down and consider seriously in a long-term way. Thanks!
