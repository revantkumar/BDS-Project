the people who against this rule because you are not good enough, you worry that the people who are brilliant than you will take place of you. However, even through the rule will not be accepted in the future there still are over billions people who are brilliant than you. You still cannot get what you want.
The truly brilliant people never worry about there will be some foreigners compete with them because what they living with is their ability, but not the protection of the country. They can have a good life even if they leave their country, but you can't.
Without the protection of the contry, you are nothing.
I believe the government will choose the people who can bring benifits to them, but not the people who only can waste their money
