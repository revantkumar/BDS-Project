I totally support the new rule because the rule not only benefits our international students but also the local government in the United States. 

I believe that all men are created equal. As an international student, I should have the same right to land a decent job as well as the local people do and the new rule invites me more opportunities to sharpen my skills in my major. 

Also, this rule brings more benefits for the government and universities since there will be more international students who specialize in engineering and other STEM fields coming there. This means the government can get a lot of revenues and international students will boost the local economy and make the university vivid. In addition, many talented students will create more values to the United States than they did in the past.

Some people may believe that this rule is terrible because international students have occupied a lot of job positions that local people should have. But, I cannot agree that. In this competitive society, it is quite obvious that people who are equipped with specialized skills and experience are naturally capable of finding a job easier than those who are not good and it is illogical to say that capable people should not have the same opportunities as local people have just because they are so talent. Besides, even if the rule has not passed, those people who cannot hunt for jobs will be still out of work because of their own faults. Consequently, this new rule has little to do with the unemployment rate for local people. 

Therefore, I believe that international students, enjoying many advantages that local people never possess should have more opportunities to improve their capabilities and to make more contribution to the United States.
