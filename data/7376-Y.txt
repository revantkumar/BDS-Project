Will ZHANG I strongly support the extension.First of all,this extension will have little negative impact on US citizens.Because job positions of STEM are not popular at all in America.Not like Finance,Lawyer or Doctor.But we do need development of technology science and engineering to further our development so that we need import more talented people from the outside.Second,this is good for both international student and America's education.On the on hand,this mayl give international student an opportunity to serve USA and gain some experience in real work.At the same time,more international student will give Universities and Colleges extra money to server American students.This is a win-win situation.Last but not at least,it is a small world now,everyone will not only compete with people living in the same country but also with foreigners.It may cause more competition and you may will learn more and work harder and harder.But isn't it the meaning of lifeTo transcend and make a better self?Besides,fear about international competetion will not help USA to become stronger.
