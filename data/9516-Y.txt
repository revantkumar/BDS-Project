OPT STEM is a good policy that can attract talented international students from around the world. 
It just make no sense, American Schools admit overseas students, give them good training and education, and send them back immediately. And there are a group of talented and young workforce which will benefit US Economy Eventually. 

And the cultural and Education background diversity can also bring different prospective to the working environment, this can bring success to the individual, company, and in the long wrong, will benefit US, since the world is becoming so globalized. And I think it is such a different generation than anything before, it is such a privilege for us as international students to visit the US and work with US people here. We feel it is such a globalized culture and environment and feel a part of it. So we want to have more chance to stay here and see what we can do to learn from and also contribute to such an creative and globalized environment.
