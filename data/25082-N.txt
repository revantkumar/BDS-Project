I know many experienced American technology workers who are unemployed or underemployed.
Has designing a program to assist American workers been considered?
Optional Practical Training (OPT) seems to be another corporate welfare program and is similar to the H1-B visa. 

I strongly oppose OPT because it favors foreign labor over American workers. 

Please do not implement this.
