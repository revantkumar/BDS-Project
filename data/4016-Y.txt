I strongly support the new 24-month STEM OPT extension for internationally graduate student from accredited universities.The United States has been known for its equal opportunities for immigrants and attracted numerous excellent talents from all over the world. The immigrants who were born outside US currently constitute about 13% of the total population. Excellent immigrants from all different fields have continuously been making significant contributions to the prosperity of the United States economy. The new proposal to increase the period for OPT extension is beneficial to the fresh foreign graduate student, to the US citizens and to the country. 

In the first place, as for foreign graduate student, they have been studying and staying in the United States for many years and got advanced education from the country. With the new OPT extension, they will gain a higher chance for a job position which requires high-skilled employees. They will be of great benefit to the employer to be more competitive in the market. As a result, it will continue to help the country flourish.

In the second place, these excellent fresh graduate are typical highly-skilled after 1-3 years in the company and have the great potential to launch their own business, which will be able to create additional job positions for the US citizens. From this perspective, this extension will benefit the US citizens in the long term.

Finally, as discussed before, the country has continuously observed its rapid development due to the advanced technology and strong economic scale. They are the foundation of today's United States and the good living conditions for the US citizens. Most of the foreign graduate students have majors in the technology and financial disciplines, whose contribution to the country cannot be underestimated.

Born equal as we are, equal chance can be given.
