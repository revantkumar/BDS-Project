I think this proposal is beneficial for both U.S. and international students and will not hurt American job seekers. As a former STEM international student, I am currently employed as an engineer on my OPT. I got this job NOT because I accepted lower salary (actually my salary is higher than the industry average). I got my job because of my 3.7 GPA and my graduate school being one of the best U.S. engineering school. Besides, before I landed on this job, most of my American classmates have already settled on their jobs and gone to summer vacation. I dont think that I post much threat to new college graduates. Honestly, I do believe their tuition could have been much higher if it was for the out-of-state tuition payment by hundreds of thousands of international students like me. Also, as far as I know, many public school scholarship targeted at U.S. citizens depend on our tuition payment. I believe this new proposal will attract more international students to U.S. alleviating financial difficulties faced by many public universities. And I am paying both federal and state taxes. The new extension allows me more time to study the application of the newest technology in my field and how the U.S. firms in my field operate business. I expect to bring better cooperation between my homeland companies and U.S. investors, which is beneficial for both parties.
