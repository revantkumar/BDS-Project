I strongly support improving and extending training opportunity for F-1 nonimmigration with STEM degree. 
This is not only a requirement from international students, but also a trend and an better way for the future development of the United States. As we all know, the world now is becoming more open and international, and recruiting international student is a symbol of globalization, which is happening all over the world. For international students, in order to have the same job opportunity, they have to be more hardworking and more competitive compared to the US citizens because of language and culture differences. Is it a bad thing to recruit international student because they have more skills and they are more hardworking? This is nonsense. 
I also read some comments from the US citizens, in which they complaint they lost their jobs because the company hired an international student. This is really a gangster logic. From a proper logic, US company must want a US citizen rather than an international student when they have equal abilities, not only because the US citizen can be more adaptive to their company culture but also it is more troublesome to recruit an international student. It is really a nonsense that you blame that international students 'robbed' of your job. It is only because you are not competitive as the international student. It is also racial to request international students to go back to their country and don't rob of your job. Please remember that we also make contributions to the development of this country!
Like I said before, globalization is an international trend, extending OPT equals to giving international student a more fair opportunity, which caters to the spirit of the country but also give US citizens an alart. Don't be lazy and try to be more competitive. As a citizen in a glorious country, yourself has to be glorious too!
