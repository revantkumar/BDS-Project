I recently graduated and received my PhD from UCLA. If I was forced to go back to my country next year after a short-lived 1 year OPT term without any opportunities for extension the only thing I could do is to thank the US government and tax-payers for all of money they gave me during the past 6 years, about 40K annually, without asking for anything in return. I have learn many things in graduate school, I can do things normal people wouldn't have the knowledge to do. My employer will be very much upset if they can't keep me around and make myself useful. It would be a loss for both sides.
