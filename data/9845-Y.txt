I strongly agree with this new regulation.

First of all, stem students have strong skills and can make great contribution for US. They make America develop faster in the past years.

Secondly, stem students are well educated and pay their tax, which is a huge amount of money, if you try to check it. They make another important contribution to American economy.

Thirdly, stem students are legally come to US, deporting them is not consistent with American spirit.

Lastly, US is so strong today is because US has the latest tech, which is dependent on knowledge. Stem students are exactly the ones well educated and intelligent.
