I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension! 
First of all, the jobs provided to foreigners are always the staff that natives are not willing to do!
Second, it is the diversity that promotes the success of many famous companies and many famous universities. 
Third, foreigners make companies grow faster and the economy grow faster by saving cost.
Then, no matter what time is the OPT, companies always need foreigners. Even though there is no OPT, companies will create a branch in foreign countries, which will only increase the cost. 
In a word, it is good for the economy of United State to extend OPT.
