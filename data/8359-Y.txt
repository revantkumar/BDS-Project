I strongly support the extension for F-1 OPT period. 

Since the start of OPT extension, we have seen a significant growth in both global IT corporations as well as local, boutique IT, data, pharmaceutical companies across the US. In the shorter run, it may seem like a distraction from local hiring for native US employees. But in the long run, we are expecting to see a growth in these industries locally, and potentially offering much more employment opportunities for both US citizens and international students.

As an economics major, I understand that if each party only fight for their own interests, the resulting outcome could be counterproductive, like prisoner's dilemma. I expect to see more collaboration from both the benefiting party of this proposal, as well as the other parties.
