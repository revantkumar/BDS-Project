Steven Black I strongly agree with Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students.
Now USA is the most powerful country in the world, but China, Japan and India has developed quickly. These countries are almost catch up us in many fields such as science, math, and astronomy and so om.
As we all know, there are a lot of foreign students in American campus. They have received high quality education in the university. They can acquire more and more knowledge to construct their own country. If we can provide jobs for them, they will stay USA after graduation. And they can make profits for our country.
We know Chen-Ning Franklin Yang, a famous physicist who comes from China, makes the great progress in physics. Sundar Pichai, the new CEO of Google, is an Indian. Look at these people, they make our country advanced than the other country, but if these people can not find the job in USA and go back to their own country, those country will develop quickly. It is really the loss of our country.
