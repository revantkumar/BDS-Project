I've noticed that there're lots of negative comments regarding this new rule. Some people said OPT denied lots of local American jobs and removed much social security and medicare trust funds.

I have to say those comments are too one-sided. It looks like OPT is taking of many jobs for Americans, however, many foreign workers in NY or Silicon Valley are creating more and more job opportunities for Americans. 

One of a founders of Google is a foreigner, the CEO of Microsoft is originally from India. But now they are providing so many job openings, right? Why don't we have a long-term view? OPT attracts many talents and they contributed a lot on US technology and then absolutely created much more things for Americans.
