Tianyi Wang I strongly support the proposal because the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Diversity is very important for U.S and many international students, especially STEM students have made tremendous contribution to the development of the U.S.. In addition, STEM students will only take up the jobs that are related to their major. A CS major student won't do accounting or art work. The extension will not hurt the native employment of other occupations.
