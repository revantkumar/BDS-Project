I work for a tech company in the R&D department. And most employees in our department are foreigners who have degrees from US college. The OPT extension can help them get their H1B visa and benefits US companies a lot. Because the companies have put a great effort to training these employees and it's going to be a huge loss if these employees have to leave the country due to visa issues. So I'm 100% support the OPT extension policy! Please do it.
