I strongly support the OPT Extension. Not extending the OPT WILL result in a loss for the US industry in an UNPRECEDENTED way. OPT extension for STEM graduates IS NOT the same issue as allowing illegal immigrants to work, unlike what's suggested by some narrow minded comments below. High tech workers WILL leave and work for other countries if this is not passed. Please don't let the narrow mindedness of a few people ruin the future of this country.
