Yanxiang Yu This is really very beneficial to both companies and international STEM students. On the side of companies, usually for an employee to fit in the environment and learn all the skills, it may take couple month to half year, therefore three years at the same position would be the best timing for an employee to devote him/herself to learn, and also achieve the highest output for an company. On the side of international STEM students, they already been filtered in their own country and school in US, they have dedicated mind to learn due to the hard-won opportunity, as well as their own talent. Because of the sponsorship requirement of future VISA, such limited one year work time already let most companies build a threshold to hire them. In this case, only study in USA cannot achieve a understanding of working environment and culture, this would be very harmful to essential meaning of studying in USA and contribute to their own country. While extend OPT to total three years would mitigate the worry for most companies as they have enough time to examine the qualification of a student without pay extra expense.
