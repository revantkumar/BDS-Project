I'm not usually "amazed" at the utter STUPIDITY and utterly INCOMPETENT actions of the Washington, D.C. bureaucrats, but this action does amaze me. Why would OUR government officials actually INCENTIVIZE companies to hire non American workers? The Obama regime has it exactly backwards, we must INCENTIVIZE hiring AMERICANS first. Or, better yet, keep politicians OUT of the workplace!
