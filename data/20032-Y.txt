My wife and I say NO to adding more foreign workers, there have been and are more on the horizon of laid off American workers, this constant move of government to increase foreign workers is insane from our perspective but we have guessed this administration has an agenda and it will not benefit the unemployed or employed American. We remind you of the fact that Obama raised the minimum wage here but in the signing of the TPP he afterwards snuck in/added the largest muslim country in the world where currently workers get $2.50 an hr. now they would certainly benefit from coming here but how will an American worker benefit from going there, nor did Mr Obama think they would? He has stated he is immigrating more like 10,000 to 100,000 (the number changes from statement to statement) muslims from Syria. 91 % of the demanding. immigrated muslims here already are on unemployment benefits or disability payments and it turns out the middle eastern man does not have employable skills/training to take his place in this society. A group of neighbors went to one of the terrorist training camps in,I believe Texas but do not quote me, to welcome them into the neighborhood incase they were being mislead by the media about how violent they are and were met on video with aggression and violence by at least one man/muslim by his attire, that was walking with a cane until he saw the visitors at which point he stopped feigning his limp and started running with the cane raised up in the ready to strike. It is said by the FBI that there are 22 verified such camps and more like as many as 35 spread throughout the U.S. DHS and FBI is certainly placing us at risk. The DOL states as off August/2015 the unemployment rate is 5% in the United States but that number excludes workers who have lost unemployment benefits nor does it include the ones on disability temporary or permanent also there are a number of major employers such as Disney World, Orlando, Florida, Disney Movies, Sears Corporati
