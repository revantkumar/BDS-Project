I strongly SUPPORT the new proposal for the following reasons:

1. This proposal will absolutely BENEFITS American economics and technology. We all know that lots of foreign students come to US to study. They are smart and hard working. They are elites of their own country. This proposal allows elites from all over the world to work and make contributions to US! It's wonderful and great! And I can't image how large is the value these people are going to create during the time of their work. 

2. US always treats DIVERSITY as one of its important feature. Diversity makes US what it is today, a country full of possibility and opportunity, a country with hope and dream. Diversity benefits US in many ways. It makes people and the country more creative. That's why US always ahead of others in the world. In US University, smartest people from the whole world get together to share knowledge and advanced technology. This makes US University the dream school of students all over world. So many Nobel prizes were produced in this kind of environment. In this case, why don't US allow the same diversity in its company? Certainly these companies will get lots of benefits from this proposal.

3. I don't think this proposal will reduce US citizen job opportunity. First, it always true that it's much harder for a foreign student to get a job than citizen of US. Second, if you look into the number of Computer Science student proportion, much more foreign students than citizen, while in business school, there are much less foreign students. Why is this? It that University has preference? No, it's citizen in US have their preference. STEM students are just making up US needs of employee in some area which US citizens are not enough number for job. Certainly this won't hurt US and its citizen, in contrast, it does GOOD for US and its citizen.
