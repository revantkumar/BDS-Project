I strongly support the extension of OPT for all F-1 international student. There are so many STEM majors which need international students/scholars because few american students are interested in doing science research, like physics, chemistry, mathematics. Most american students want to be lawyer, doctor, banker instead of chemist, physicist. No wonder this rule will benefit the whole country to make a win-win result.
