Steven Lee This rule will surely boost America economy.
As a recruiter, I have been working in the tech company for 3 years, we choose citizens over foreign students every time to avoid the pain walking them through the immigration process.However, we don't have many qualified american applicants to fill the chairs.

On the other hand, compare to people who have never been to US before, STEM students receive their education in here and fit in our culture better. 

Please have this rule approved, we really need this.

and again, why don't we have some rules to encourage young Americans to go for a STEM degree?
