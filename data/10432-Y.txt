I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. Why not let more well-educated and diverse people stay in U.S. And make it a better country.

3. Competition doesexist, but is not a bad thing. The U.S. can't avoid competition by just prevend well educated people working in the country. It's the competition that makes this country stronger and stronger.
