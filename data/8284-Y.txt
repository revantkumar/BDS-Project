The majority of the opposing comments to the proposed rule are based on the assumptions that it would harm American workers in the sense that (1) finding a job would be more difficult with an already-high unemployment rate; and (2) companies would prefer to hire foreigners over qualified Americans because they don't have to pay their share of payroll taxes. However, I don't think these assumptions are well made.

According to the recent reports by Raytheon and U.S. News (see attachments), there is a big gap between the skills available in the workforce and those required in STEM jobs. There are 12 million Americans unemployed, but there are also 3.6 million job openings unfilled due to a lack of qualified workers! Over 65% of manufacturing companies are experiencing a shortage of qualified workers, and this shortage is expected to increase in the next 3 to 5 years. STEM students are not in the U.S. to fight for jobs with Americans, but they are here to fill in the gap and drive the U.S. economy. Filling the gap will not affect qualified or unemployed American workers in STEM or other fields. It is predicted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that there will be almost 9 million STEM jobs available in 2018. However, a lack of supporting mechanism, such as OPT extension, would result in a dramatic loss of foreign STEM graduates and thus a larger skill gap in the workforce.

I would urge the U.S. government to approve the proposed rule for a great benefit to the U.S. economy and society.
