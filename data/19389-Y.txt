To whom it may concern,
I graduated from New York University in financial engineering in 2014. 
I strongly support the proposal for the following reason:
When I was young, America is famous for its freedom. Just because of that, more and more smart people prefer to work and live in USA. the conservative protection policy is kind of ridiculous. And also America benefited a lot from the free and diversity, i think government should keep encouraging international students to make contributions to the US.
