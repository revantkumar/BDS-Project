I strongly support the extension of OPT. 

The most important reason for I choose universities in U.S instead of those UK is that I am able to work in America for a period of time after finishing my Ph.D.. This is a great chance for me apply I learn and contribute to American social because of time and money they put to educate a Ph.D. like me. As for U.K., it is very hard to the graduated students to stay in here to work after the graduation.

Besides, as far as I know, many employees in high-tech companies are not born in the U.S., in other words, they are not U.S. citizens before they come to work for those companies. Even if the government restricted foreigners to find a job in the field of STEM, it wouldn't help reduce the overall unemployment rate, but might result in a situation where those high-tech companies cannot find qualified employees, which in turn hampers the competitiveness of the U.S. high-tech companies. In fact, the unemployments of American happen not in the industries of STEM, but in other industries.
