I strongly support opt extension. International students pay premium dollars to get an American education so they deserve an opportunity to get a job. On the other hand, please investigate H1b and H4 contracting companies like Infosys, Tata CS and Cognizant who monopolize the STEM job market and fake H1b applications.
