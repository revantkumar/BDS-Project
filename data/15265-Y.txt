I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. A lot of great people with great success are immigrants. They all got their MS/PHD degree in US.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition are good for people to improve. And it is good for United States in a long way.
