I strongly support this opt extension proposal. It will be a big loss for companies hire new graduate students for just one year, a lot of companies have big requirement to hire STEM related new hires. And also students can also have enough opportunities to apply what they have learned at university and make contribution to the companies. US economy can benefited a lot if this proposal can pass. This proposal can also increase US universities' competition, will attract more and more talented students come to US to study.
