I feel like that a lot of negative comments posted here are from people who do not understand OPT and the whole process. For most companies, recruiting a foreign student actually costs more than recruiting a U.S. citizen, because the company will need to pay for sponsoring h1-b visa for the foreign worker. Thus, the foreign workers are not "cheaper", but in fact "more expensive" in terms of the amount that the company needs to pay. The company's decision of whether using a more expensive worker or not depends on the worker's competence. Allowing only the good/more competent foreign students to be able to find jobs and work in the U.S. after graduation. Furthermore, the OPT is not a training, it's more of a visa status before getting a H1-B. Making OPT time longer definitely is a good idea for many companies who need competent workers, since H1-B is totally random. Extending OPT is definitely going to help a lot of companies in the U.S.
