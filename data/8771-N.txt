To the Folks in Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau,

You are trying to import workers to our country when there are thousands qualified to work at these various jobs and who are UNEMPLOYED. What is wrong with us that you would prefer foreign workers to Americans? To add insult to injury this department is taking money from Social Security to help fund this move! In a surprising move even those on the "left" side of this issue are against this disturbing action. 

Those American workers who are qualified for these jobs are in deep debt with college loans believing that they would become employed, yet you would hire from outside this country. This is truly sad and a slap in face of anyone who believed that they would put their talents to use. Your distain for our country and citizens is on full display, no amount of words of justification can hide this. You would betray America for cheap labor. Is having cheap labor more important than employing Americans, or is this just another political move worked between big labor and this administration? Your actions are contemptuous and treasonous by draining money intended for others and giving it for foreign countries.

I will everything I can to stop this deplorable move.
