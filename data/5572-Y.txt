I'm strongly supporting the proposed rule to improve and expand OPT for F-1 students with STEM degrees. 

OPT and the extension for STEM foreign students is a very important factor to attract international student to pursue their education in US. This makes US universities very competitive compared to other countries. Owing to this, the U.S. academic sector can remain to attract talented international students. Besides, with international students involved in research and projects, the nation's economic, scientific and technological ability are enhanced. 

OPT and its extension is not just related to the post graduate working opportunities, it affects the decision whether or not come to America for education. If the one cannot get industry experience in the country where he pursues the degree, why does he still choose to come here? When I made my decision of where to continue my graduate study, America was my first choice, not only because it has most outstanding universities and academic environment, but also the OPT opportunities. Most of my classmates who went to UK for Master's degree had to go back home or apply for US for another degree. Without any working experience in UK, they don't feel more competitive in out own country. This is also the reason why they also consider to get another degree in US. But if the OPT extension, or even OPT is eliminated, why do I and other foreign students consider US as the first option for studying abroad?

So international students are not the only group beneficial from OPT and its extension, more importantly, the US academic sector and the nation's economy and technology benefit. It's a win-win condition which should be widely supported.
