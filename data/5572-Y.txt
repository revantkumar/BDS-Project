YUHAN ZHOU I believe the OPT extension will be beneficial for attracting international STEM students to contribute their hardworking and creativity to the united states.

I read some comments from other people whom mentioned that the government should provide more opportunities to US citizens instead of foreigners. I think they misunderstood the spirit of the united states where equality and freedom is the basement for the economic and cultural development. The international students will bring their creativity and energy to here which is irreplaceable. Therefore, the government should provide a practical solution to help them settling down on the dream land. On the other hand, potential competition between local citizens and international students can be kind of pressure for local people to work hard instead of relying on the government too much.
