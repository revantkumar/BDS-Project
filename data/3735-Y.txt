Trecy Ou In the labor market, international students are treated equally as US citizens. Companies use the same standard to hire people. The working benefits are also same to anybody. It is not the opt students' fault if a US citizen cannot pass the interview or get a job. Stop blaming anyone but improve yourself. There are many excellent US citizen and also many international workers in my company. They pay taxes and make contribution to the whole society. Ppl who should be blamed and get punished are those who make up resume and sell "experienced" workers to their clients. They lie on resume, they ignore the laws and they even lie on h1b visa lottery.
