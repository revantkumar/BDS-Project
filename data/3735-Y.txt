As a college student, I was lucky to have the opportunity to do an internship during the summer. I had to say, the training is so important in cultivating the people that can really benefit the world. It is well known that the knowledge learned in the college is more about theoretic and cannot be applied directly to practical. The training which provides the opportunities to work in the company help the students learn how to make knowledge powerful. For example, students in the college may not have change to design real mechanism to save the energy consumption. While if the students are provided the opportunities in the company, their design mechanism may have the opportunity to be test in practice and may save a lot of computing power which help protecting the environment. As the popularity of cloud computing, and consider the fact that 2% of US's electricity is consumed by the cloud computing data centers, this issue is critical. Thus, training the F-1 students with the OPT permits benefits US, and contribute to the world environment protection.
