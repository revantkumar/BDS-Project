Harry Qin I strongly support to proposal to extand OPT for STEM F-1 student. 

It benefits both students and the economy, especially from a long-run perspective.

It is true that in the short-term it intensifies competition in the STEM market. However, in the long run, the talents these highly-educated STEM students bring to the economy create far more jobs than they take away.
