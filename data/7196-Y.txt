I SUPPORT this proposal by the DHS to extent OPT for international students because:

- They DO pay their taxes. For people who deny this, I have to say there is no base or evidence that international students don't pay their taxes. 

- They are NOT relying on social benefits. They are not claiming benefit checks from the government month to month. In addition, they are mostly young professionals who are in their prime and less of a burden to the medicaid system.

- They are CONSUMERS. They buy goods and services from many small US businesses - land lords, shops, malls, restaurants, etc. which are critical to local businesses.

- They do NOT cause domestic unemployment. When Cuban refugees rushed to the city of Miami in 1959, there was no evidence to support the claim that refugees would bring down wages of US workers. In fact, a vibrant community grew and prospered. Same conclusion is supported by many studies and social experiments again and again. STEM majors are in high demands - a constant shortage of skilled workers. International students don't take those jobs from US workers, if the demands can't be sufficiently met. The US government should not create artificial monopoly. It's against the essence of free market and capitalism.

- They are KEY for US's technological advances. Skills in STEM are very important for America to keep its edge in today's competitive world. We don't want to train them in our universities and push these talented and motivated individuals to Russia, China, India, etc. It's not the best interest for America, and it doesn't make any sense to do so.

For all the reasons above, I support the proposal by the DHS on OPT extension. It will be a WRONG decision if this proposal is rejected; and many America businesses are going to take a loss.
