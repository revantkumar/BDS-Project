I am super supportive for this act. Actually I am a graduate student studying Engineering in Purdue University. Purdue is a university famous for Engineering, and here I have come across many great engineers from all over the world. More than just students, I have seen a lot of families as well. It is quite pleasant to see so many spouses also staying here in the US, and it is so amazing to see how many babies were born here during the graduate program time. I have seen a lot of families who have had a great great time here during the school time, with their spouses and children. However, I am wondering when they graduate and started entering the working force, if they cannot get a valid working visa, and there is no OPT to be used, how will they continue their lifes here in the USA? Their husbands/wives cannot do anything but to stay at home and waste their time, even though that they have the knowledge and ability to get a job (but no visa). They cannot stay here to take care of the babies even, and need to go back to their original country and be separated with their babies. This is such a disaster. 

I think with a OPT extension, such problems won't happen as often, and there will be more families who can happily live and study here!
