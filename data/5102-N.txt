What has happened to the United States of America?" We the people" have failed to hold elected officials accountable for their actions. This has happened because the Government has become so large that the people aren't even aware of what is happening in Congress and every dept. in Wash.. It's all done behind closed doors. If this current proposal to increase work permits to foreigners were put to a vote and announced on the major news outlets, I can tell you it would be voted down. It is time to stop all work permits and Visas until we get a handle on just how many illegals are in this country and why DHS won't deport them. It is time to put the American citizen first. When our country is flooded with illegals and foreigners competing for the same jobs and opportunities, it's a matter of simple supply and demand. Companies hiring illegals and foreigners and not having to pay the payroll taxes is criminal and goes against what this country stands for. Do not expand any H-1B, H5, OPT, or any other type of permit or Visa.
