I strongly agree with the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the well-educated talented students stay in the country and let them make differene to the U.S..
2. Diversity is valued a lot by the U.S socitety. 30% of Nobel prizes are people studying abroad.
3. Competition is good for both foreigners and US citizens. This will definitely strength US. Foreign students can meet the need for intellectual people that US might be short of.
