I strongly support this rules.

I came to United States in 2008. I spent 2 years Master in New York and 5 years PhD student in Dallas. Now I am a software developer in Milpitas, CA.

First of all, I lived in United States for over 7 years. So I paid social security tax even I am in my OPT.

Second, OPT policy will greatly benefit both students and the high tech companies. In fact, the students with OPT qualifications are well-educated. They are trying to build more startup companies which will provide more jobs for the local people.

Third, the consulting companies like Infosys and Tata CS uses up the H1B 
(see: http://www.myvisajobs.com/Computer-Systems-Design-and-Related-Services-5415-2015IN.htm). They take the job opportunities from local people. As I know, they break the law to apply multiple H1B for one people in one position. The New York Times have reported some bad facts these consulting companies (see: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/us/large-companies-game-h-1b-visa-program-leaving-smaller-ones-in-the-cold.html?_r=0).

OPT is only optional training for students. They can really learn a lot from real industrial experience beside courses.
