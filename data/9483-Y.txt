The proposed rule of extension would surely help the STEM students to enhance their knowledge in their respective fields. It would also help the U.S government in economy and also encourage foriegn students. I will accept the rule for extension and it would help every one. STEM students are very happy with the proposed rule and surely the number will increase in coming years.
