This proposal is a vital transition way for outstanding STEM students legally working in US. Those students earns those opportunity by their superior experience and knowledge but not by lost cost to steal jobs from local people. As the h1b lottery becomes harder than before, such outstanding students need this transition to continue working in US. 

If this regulation could not pass, US will lose thousands of highly skill professions and they will flow to other geographic to compete US industries.

To reduce low cost/skill forging workers, new regulations to screen the outsourcing companies is the key, but not evict US degreed students by vacating STEM extension rule
