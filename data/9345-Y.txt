I support to keep Stem Extension Program for the following reasons:
1. Students from this program are educated and talented, they can contribute and add value to their companies.
2. Talented manpower is a very important resource not only for a company but also for a country, talented students can help develop economy, which can lead to Increasing employment opportunities.
3. The program can help companies keep employee who is right for the position and contribute to company.
Stem Opt Extension program is a three win for the country, company and the employee.
