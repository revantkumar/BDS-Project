Ohbby G I think the idea of expanding the OPT duration is not simply decided to be good or bad. For me, I would rather DHS or whoever in charge of H1B visa issuance should be more responsible at their jobs. I heard some guys from India could use like 25 applications to apply for a H1B visa. This is the really unfair for all other applicators.
