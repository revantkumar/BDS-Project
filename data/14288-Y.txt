I strongly support the new OPT-extension and Cap-Gap relief for the following reasons: 

If intelligent International students with STEM degrees were allowed to work more 24 more months, they would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as development in technology. 24 months more employment benefits both the employers and the employees hugely. International students got the best education from American colleges. It is their duty to contribute to the American economics as return.

Also, it turns out that out of all potential international employees, only 19% of them could stay and get a working VISA from the lottery. Most of them will eventually go to their home country and work there, leaving a lot of vacancies for newly graduated students.
