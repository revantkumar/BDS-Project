I strongly support the proposed rule for the following reasons:
1. Foreign students are not the reason of unemployment of Americans. Most is the job opportunities occupied by foreign students, especially in STEM, cannot find qualified American employees to fulfill the position. Foreign students showed outstanding performance and ability in numerous majors, which never hurts the chance for Americans to demonstrate the same level or even better performances. There is no reason for employers to hire foreign students instead of Americans if the two groups show same performance and abilit. 

2. Foreign students make a lot of contribution to the progress of many industries. Only the thrive of industries can provide more job opportunities, not only in STEM majors, but also all other supporting or relavent majors. This will highly benefit the employment of American employees. If companies are forced to hire unqualified American employees due to policy reason, this will diminish the development and growth of the entire economy structure of US, which will result in more difficulties in employment.

As a result, I strongly support the proposed rule for extending opt for STEM F1 students.
