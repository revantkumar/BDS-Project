As an immigration nation, the essence of American is about freedom and liberty. The reason why American is the No.1 country in the world is because of the creativity of the people regardless of their background, the wiliness to accept different value and culture, and the whole organic system to nurture the freedom and bravery. 

Allowing the survival space for American-trained foreigners is one of such measures to keep the tradition of American as the best country in the world.
