I strongly support the proposal to extend F-1 non-immigrant student optional practical training (OPT) time to 24 months as it would benefit both the students and the employers of the US.
The international students can benefit largely from the extended work experience in the united states and apply their knowledge when they return to home country. 12 months is not sufficient time for a fresher to learn the vital aspects of any technology in any firm. The extension would help the students to get a adequate grasp of the practical application their education.
Also, employers would be more keen to employ international students if the students can work for at least few years so that the company can recover the resources spent on the students training and grooming etc. Most of the initial 12 months is spent on training the new joiners and only after that the new joiners actually start contributing to the organization.
