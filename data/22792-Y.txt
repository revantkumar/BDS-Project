I abosultely support this rule for the following reasons:
1. This rule provides a great chance for foreign students who work hard and also talented to have better opportunity to further practice 
2. It benefits US economy to have talented foreign people work in engineering area.
3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented foreign students purchasing master degree in US.
