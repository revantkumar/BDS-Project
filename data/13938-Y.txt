I support the 24 months stem policy!

As a university faculty, I know go important this is for the universities and colleges to attract foreign students, a majority of whom chose to come to US and chose to pursue a stem major here because they know the stem policy provides more security for their job hunting effort!

Canceling the rule will not only impose a big impact for industry, not also for education institutes!
