I strongly support this OPT extension policy.
One key point to USA success today is its diversity and it can always attract the best workers and talented students all over the world, these immigrants is a vital part of America and they make tremendous contribution in USA economy development.
Some american citizens are worried about their own employment which might be taken by immigrants. however, these immigrants will make USA economy better and they will create lots of new jobs. So the OPT extension policy is not only good to STEM students, but also will benefit the american citizens. Instead, without the OPT extension policy, USA will be less attractive to STEM students, and the knowledge and technology they master will not make any contribution to USA economy.
