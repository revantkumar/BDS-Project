I STRONGLY SUPPORT the OPT extension for STEM students.

300 years ago, no one in the world realized what a magical place here is. Today, America stands at the top of the pyramid of the entire world. What makes this come true? Technics and hardworking of people from all over the world. We built this country to the most powerful by offering oppotunity for everyone who willing to contribute to America. Students after studying years in US universities are those guys. The rapid pace Internet, engineering and other fields create many more jobs in America. These students are constructors along with native employees instead of competitors.
