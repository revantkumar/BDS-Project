I support this new 24-Months STEM extension proposal. Even though I don't need this extension any more. But I figured I should say something about it. 
In order to maintain the leadership all over the world, United States has to make sure it is the top tier country in terms of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics all the time, every single moment, no exception. Those fields are the foundation that not only keeping United States as the greatest and most powerful nation for over a century, but also ensuring the advancement of the whole human society going forward. The good thing is that STEM almost covers all these fields that would really help United States, furthermore the group of people will be benefited within this program are all young, well-educated people. That means the key for the future is on your hand as long as you wish to use it. I hope the government think more carefully what exactly this country needs compare to what you are doing right now, bad policies you take today would end up with bad results. Do not ruin the future. Not only theirs, but also everyones.
