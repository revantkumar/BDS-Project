Huichao Zhu I deeply agree this project will be approved.

Firstly, nobody can steal the oppotunity of getting a better job, just ourselves can make it happen. I believe the United States is the most development country not because they complacent and conservative. More challege means more oppotunity, all the people who say that international students steal their job are too extreme. They need to ask the people who get a lot of profit from international students, like supermarkets, restautants, universities. Because of us, there are a lot of oppotunities for new job have been created. Along with the descreasing of unemployment rate in America, it's a good opponitunity to appeal more talet people to work here by approve the project.

Secondly, I think it is a decisive bill if we can make it happen. More and more Cutting-edge talent will be attracted by it. It just a tiny piece of people who are imigrating to America. Comparing with the jobs they occupied, I believe that they can create hundreds of thousands of times opponitunies of jobs. As Donald trump's words, When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best. Theyre not sending you. Theyre not sending you. Theyre sending people that have lots of problems, and theyre bringing those problems with us. Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.(A little bit interesting...) Why not by this means of attracting more talent by approving this bill.
