This program ends up hurting the citizens and LEGAL immigrants of this country, because these OPTs end up costing over 100,000 STEM jobs per year. These OPT workers are not paying into Medicare or SS trust funds, removing about $1 Billion a year. Employers end up paying much less for these OPT workers, so they are more likely to be hired than qualified US citizens or legal immigrants, who earn the prevailing wage. 
Do not extend the time these OPT workers are allowed to steal jobs from US Citizens and legal immigrants. They also receive special training to supposedly reduce the shortage of STEM workers. Why can't US Citizens qualify for this special training? Besides, there are way more qualified STEM workers already unemployed in this country. Why do companies like SCE, Disney and even the State of California force US Citizens to train their foreign replacement workers then terminate the US Citizens? This should be illegal. Why not require any company who claims they "can't find a qualified US STEM worker", to pay prevailing wages to their H1-B visa holders? In fact, they should be required to pay an additional 10-15% for each H1-B worker for prospective employee searches and training, so we keep the training and jobs for our own out of work citizens.
