Wei Bai I strongly stand by expanding OPT. 

I am a PhD student in US. More than half of the students in my program are international. As we all know one-year work experience is quit short for even putting on resume, don't even mention about make significant progress in STEM area. So if there is no OPT extension most of international students will go back to their home. This is a huge loss to America. As everybody knows, training a PhD student requires significant amount of money and time. If all these students return to there own country, America is paying for educating outstanding scholars all over the world. A lot of countries are offering all kinds of privilege for the students who want to go back to their home country. The reason thousands of international students want to stay is that up to now US is at the leading position in academic world. It won't remain true for long if US forcing international students to go back to their own country and all other countries are trying to attract outstanding scholars from all over the world.

As for the job market, if there is an American that is as qualified as the international student, no company will pick international student for sure. Companies under go so many risks and difficulties when hiring an international student. They do this because there is a shortage in certain job market. Giving OPT extension to international students in STEM will not affect any other job market.
