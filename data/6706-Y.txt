I definately support this rule for the following reasons.

1. OPT actually is a part of US educational system, from not only international students but also local people's view. If it is prolonged, there will definately more students from all over the world be attracted to th US, which is good for the educational industries and ecomony in US, and beneficial to every STEM students as well.

2. There were so many talented and well-trained students leaving the US, not because of breaking law, or that they cannot find a job, but because the current policies does not provide a reasonable time to let them do this. In this way, US might lose a lot of elites in every filed. And these people will in the future actually improve the employment in United States. If a new policy increases the possibility of a good student/worker/researcher staying here, then why not? No to mention that competition enhances both US people and nonimmigrant students.

3. Equality, as a spirit of the United Status, is being harmed by the current policy. Every good student deserve a opportunity to choose their path after graduation, and the OPT policy should be helping, not a obstacle. And Every US company own the right to hire every legal, well-trained, kind employee they want from international graduates. To some extent, current policy is discriminational.
