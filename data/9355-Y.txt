This is really a good news to international students if it can be approved.

After 3 years graduate school, I found it's still not that easy to find an ideal job, at least for new graduates without too much experience. For those who didn't get H1B in two years, their work passion faded very fast when they plan to leave and their companies start to search new guys. 

If this policy can pass, I think international students will be more glad to work every day, have more time to find a suitable nice job, and can get enough experience to start new career back in home county even not get H1B in 3 years.

Hope it can be approved eventually.
