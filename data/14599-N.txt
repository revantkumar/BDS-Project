I continue to be dismayed at the insensitivity by the Federal Government toward unemployed U.S. workers. This proposed rule is another example of bureaucrats having too much time on their hands without accountability. I adamantly object and oppose this proposed rule.

How about guarding our borders, culture, and language!
