I strongly support increasing the F1 Stem OPT extension to 24 months. This gives deserving students the opportunity to succeed in the US and contribute to the economy. As president Obama said,"This is a country of immigrants" and hence the greatest country in the world. Time and again, immigrants contribute a lot to the US economy and this extension is a right step in making the American dream come true for a lot of immigrants.
