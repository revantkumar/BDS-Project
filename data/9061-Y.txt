I was a International student and currently working under H1B Visa.

Benefited from OPT STEM extension myself, I do not want to talk about the interest of STEM extension for the International students today.

I believe it is extremely unwise NOT to provide as many as possible opportunities for international students to work in the United States. I believe it based on a simple truth - these students have taken part of the best education resources in the United Stats. They would work and contribute to the society anyway. If the United States does not allow them to work for the US, they would go back home and work for China, India, and Russia.

To me, it is interesting to see a champion scared of competition, so is the world.
