I support the expanding of OPT. 

Thousands of foreign graduates in the US plays an important role in industry. Without them, companies will lose many competitive employees. I do not think that these companies, most of which are high tech ones, can suffer such a disaster. 

Since fewer foreign students can work in this country, fewer foreigners will be willing to get a degree in the US. According to what I know, universities and colleges will face budget deficits if they cannot find enough international students.
