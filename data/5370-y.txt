Rupachowdary Vadlapatla As an international student and stem graduate,I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of skilled students in f-1 status who are contributing to u.s innovation,technology improvements and u.s economy.I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT extension rule.
