I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension for the following reason:
1. There are thousands of international students. They come to US because they believe that US is a country worth for them to make contribution to. They already made a lot of contribution in the school. The government should give them opportunity to let them prove they can do more for US.
2. Many of the great scientists were from other countries. They were international students too. Most of the great research projects started from the university. Most of them spent many many years on their projects and finally get great accomplishment or amazing invention. Without the opportunities given by the US government, they won't go that far. 
3. As long as their are people, there will be competition. Some people think international students take the jobs that should belong to the local people. However, jobs are only belong to people who are qualified. International students get the jobs by their hard working. Moreover, while this competition happening, the local students also improve themselves. This is a good thing for US. Escaping from competition will only lower the skills, knowledge, and ability of the students.
4. US is a country of freedom. Even people come from other country. They should feel the good of US.
