Paul Lozancich I'm against increasing the quota of immigrants allowed in or increasing the amount of time that they are allowed to stay in our country. This will take STEM jobs away from American citizens. It will also depress STEM job wages. The only one who benefits from these rules is the corporations who get cheap labor.
