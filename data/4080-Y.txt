I strongly support this new proposal! I am a STEM student working on Cancer and infectious disease researches. The reason I apply to US university is to continue my research in this field so that I can make contributions to the preventing, controlling and curing of the diseases. If I don't have STEM extension any more, I will not be able to continue my research in the future. I know many friends of mine in this field are also facing the same problem. I believe that more people are going to have the same issue. Why expel students who want to contribute to US and the world.
