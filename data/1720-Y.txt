I strongly support OPT extension! International students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.
People who oppose to this new rule don't really have a solid point. They blamed international students for taking their jobs, or complained the polices of the government but never thought about how to improve themselves.
