Ernie Palmquist I am opposed to bringing in more foreign workers to fill jobs that qualified American workers are available to fill. If these were American citizens it would increase the tax base, provide much needed income for our families. Unimployment would decrease and everyone in this country would benefit because their income would stay in America where it would buy goods and services and bolster our economy.
