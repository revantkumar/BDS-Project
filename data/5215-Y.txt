I think it is super reasonable to improve or expand the training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees. In fact, there doesn't exist any negative effect, mentioned in those anti-OPT-extension opinions, on the employment of the Americans. One is based on the regulation, OPT holders can ONLY apply for those jobs related to their degrees directly. Moreover, it is required by law that the wage of OPT holders as same as the US citizens. Therefore, many companies in U.S strongly prefer equally skilled Americans based on the language and culture backgrounds. However, why do we still see a lot of foreigners working in the US companies today and even they need the visa sponsorship? The reason is simple and straightforward. Americans can't supply enough skilled employers for those job openings. And those talented highly-educated OPT holders hired by U.S companies not only don't take jobs from the native Americans but significantly improve the US economy. Last point of view I wanna make here is a lot of foreign graduate students are financial sponsored by the US government or universities. It is absolutely unwise to kick them out along with their professional skills or knowledge they haven't contributed to the United States.
