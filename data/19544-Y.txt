It is absolutely necessary to extend OPT for students with STEM degrees. First of all, STEM students have the abilities that most of citizens do not have to help companies drive more value. Second, they make a decent amount of money. They will also spend their income in the U.S. which is good for economics. Third, they are not stealing citizens' jobs because most of the citizens tend to avoid these areas. Last but not least, they are paying a lot of taxes including FICA tax whereas fifty percent of citizens do not pay taxes.
