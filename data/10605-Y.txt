I strongly support this Proposed Rule. As a software developer who are currently works in H1B Visa, I think this rule has the following benefits:
1. Highly educated F-1 students will make a contribution to the economy of US. 
2. Employers will be benefit from this rule since more high quality labor force available in market.
3. With longer OPT term for STEM degrees will attract more international students to study in American for STEM degrees. And these people will bring large amount of income for the Education System of US.
