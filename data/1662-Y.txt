I think it's very important to extent the STEM OPT time. Because it good for American economic. If they do not have the chance to stay here, they have to go back to their hometown and contribute to their hometown economic. 

Further more, if STEM extension is denied, large amount of companies will suddenly lose work force due to little local people study STEM major and there will be a big cost for hiring new STEM talent each year.
