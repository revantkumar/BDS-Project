Anonymous Anonymous Please implement this new 24 Month OPT extension proposal.
They are contributing to this country from the point when they landed. International students needs to pay more than 3 times tuition to American student during the college. Those income from international students tuition has been a huge part for local economy. International students knows life is expensive, they need to study hard, phD students do research, they help professor teaching students, and even the income they earned during the school, they pay the same tax to the government. For those master degree student, they don't even have time and opportunity to practice what they learn during school. They only opportunity for them is OPT, they apply what they learn in school, keep US advanced the world in all those STEM fields, paying the same tax that is almost 50% to the government. I can't tell where is harmful for US to extend this OPT.
