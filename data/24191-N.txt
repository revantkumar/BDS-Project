There is not one other country on Earth who offers any American an opportunity to study or work. American corporations have been given tax credits and other cash benefits for outsourcing, sending American jobs overseas, but for those American corporations who really cannot relocate, the US government has paid for all kinds of special training and handed out millions of special visas all to foreigners in order to take jobs from Americans, especially American college graduates. This is beyond shameful. This is despicable and disgraceful. I have three nephews and nieces, all highly skilled and trained who cannot get a job in their fields because those jobs are handed out only to foreign workers. I am embarrassed to be an American. No other country helps Americans, and our own government goes out of its way to harm Americans. Shame on you!!! I have two siblings who are technology/math/computer experts, and have worked for 40 years or more. Their skills are so irreplaceable that their employers would love to replace them with foreign workers but cannot. What my siblings have discovered is that the foreign workers invited to take American jobs are totally unskilled! They have to be constantly tutored to do any work with any worth. In every technology company across America, you won't even hear English being spoken. Between Indian dialects and Asian languages, American businesses are essentially totally foreign. Shame on you!!!! This is wrong.
