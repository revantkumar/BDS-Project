I support the rule as it will allow the international students to stay for a longer duration during which they can gain the working experience in their field of interest. Also, it is beneficial for the government because it will reduce the pressure on H1-B visa to some extent as many students prefer going back to their home countries after two-three years of work experience. Once again, I support this decision.
