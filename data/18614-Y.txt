I am writing to submit the following comments in response to the new Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

First of all, it is the tradition and foundation of the United States to attract new students with highly desired skills. The beneficiaries of OPT Extension program are new graduates with STEM degrees; they are equipped with the right skills and are immediately able to make contributions in the high-tech and engineering fields. Not only high-techs play a more and more important role in U.S. economy, they also lay foundation for the U.S. to remain the world leader. Those young students are great additions the to the workforce and in turn they will help the country to build the future. 

Second, extending the OPT extension to 24 months is win-win solution for both the students and U.S. higher education system. It ensures sufficient amount of time for students to be trained and gain practical experience; and this welcoming policy will help to attract more outstanding international students. 

To summaries, in support of the proposed rule, I urge you to backing the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. 

Thank you for your consideration!
