I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is very important in the United States. Before many international talents in different areas have made achievements, they all had experience in studying in the United States. 

2. Competitions can help enterprises or international companies select excellent talents. In fact, many outstanding international students who have achieved U.S university degrees make contributions in many areas. Some of them have wills to go back to their home countries to start their careers. Therefore, the competitiveness of the United States cannot leave without the contribution of the international talents.

3. The government should encourage outstanding international students to keep making contributions to the United States. Otherwise, the United States will lose a great number of talents. Competitions will both encourage local students and international students to study hard.
