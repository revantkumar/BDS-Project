I strongly support the OPT extension for the following reasons.
1. International STEM students are not taking work opportunities away from Americans. Among the STEM students in my University, American students only take a very small portion, about 10 percent or so. The rest 90 percent are International students and most of them are from Asia. Not many Americans are interested to be engineers. Driving the International students away won't result in a significant rise of numbers of Americans in STEM area.
2. Canceling the extension will greatly harm the IT companies in the US. Those companies will lose a great number of employees, which will also harm the economy.
3. Many students attend Universities in the US for the opportunity to work here. Canceling the extension will also greatly harm those Universities.
4. Canceling the extension will greatly harm the diversity in the US, which is also a bad thing.
