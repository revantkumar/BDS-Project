I strongly support the 36 month OPT rules.

I don't understand why there's so much negative comments that doesn't make any sense. 
I believe these guy never read the proposed file.

First of all, international STEM students are not competing with American works.
Form the U.S. News(http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real)
If you go to the university, you can see most of the STEM students are international student. It is true that most American student don't like STEM major, and the job market have a high demand of STEM students.

Second, International students do not harm the economic of the country. In academic year 2013-2014, international students contribute $26.8 billon.(http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/eis2014/USA.pdf)

Third, it is not cheap to hire OPT student. Some people argue OPT student is willing to get lower salary. It's absolutely not true. Most of computer science new graduates receive more than $100,000 salary per year.

I always thinking people should know it before talk about it. For those people who post unreasonable comments, I strongly recommend you to read the proposed file first, and do some research before saying a word.
