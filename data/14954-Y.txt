I am supporting this proposed rule. 
Extending training opportunities for foreign students does not mean fewer job openings for domestic Americans; it's creating more opportunities for everyone by boosting the global economy and generating new knowledge. If it weren't for the collective efforts made by both Americans and international intellectuals, we wouldn't have had an unprecedentedly promising prospect of new technological industries. Opposing this proposed rule and creating boundaries in an era when nothing should be more encouraged than the exchange of knowledge is just nonsensical and sad. Changes are only scary to those who do not have the competency to face the challenges.
