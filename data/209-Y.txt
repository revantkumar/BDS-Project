Tina Liu I strongly agree the OPT extensions program shall be approved. There will be great benefits for this program.
1. OPT extension program will attract more talented international students to come to US universities and will boost US universities to become better and more advanced in the world in academic and professional fields.
2. More students attraced by OPT extension program will imporve the local economy for universities and college campus. From my experience, the town my university in has benefitted a lot from international students in both housiing, resteraunts etc.
3. Companies will rely on OPT extension program to finish there long-term projects. Since long-term projects are mostly 2-3 years long. And 1 year OPT program will not be enought. For companies currently employing international students will suffer from great loss if these employees have to leave after 1 year.
