Students who are willing to apply for OPT and even longer time are supposed to be the better students in schools. Not all international students have the intention or ability to apply for and even obtain a job during OPT period. Extending OPT as well as for non-STEM students definitely helps those better students to better contribute to our society. Not as the other people saying that we should preserve job positions for us Americans just because we came here earlier, this is discrimination. This job market should be fair and in an effort to better serve the country. For the good of our nation's future, I do consider that better students deserve more time to develop themselves and to help with our economy in the future. I believe that those students who don't have the ability or capability to take the job would eventually leave the states, so no worries that they would fight with us for job opportunities if we are good enough. Everybody deserves the same opportunity, this is the American will of freedom that we share. For the future good of our country, I do consider this new rule applicable.
