Yuming Liu I think the OPT extension definitely should be supported
First, the international students didn't compete with the natives. There are foreign engineers working in companies now, but this doesn't mean that the natives don't have jobs. The American people still have their jobs. Because they were born in the USA, they're well protected, and they are always the leaders in the companies. The reason why the foreign engineers working here is not the companies prefer the international students, however, it's the opposite. They just need lots of people to work for them, so except for the natives, they hire international students as well.
Second, if there is no extension of OPT, this means that lots of the companies have to let their foreign engineers go in such a short time, failing to find people to take charge of these part of work. The number of native engineers are not enough. The people living in the USA grow up according to their own interest, so the government can't force the people to be STEM engineers in the future, as well as in such a short time.
So EXTENSION OF OPT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED!!!
