Expanding OPT will be a wise decision. U.S spends so much on developing higher education, not only in hardware but in improving quality of education as well. The resources should pay off by giving more time to international students to utilize what they learned to real industry, otherwise U.S. are paying money to cultivate talents for others. American is a immigration country. Why should we limit ourselves in the cage and say no to smart to people? 

People are arguing that it is not fair for U.S. students. But the truth is that their have much much more chances than international students because they won't need sponsorship. Under the same conditions, companies will definitely choose U.S. students over international students, Additionally, a lot of companies reply heavily on international students who are on their OPT. If the program is stopped, there must be a great loss for those companies as well as U.S economy.
