I am a graduate student here in U.S. and as I see in my school, 4/5 of the graduate students in Science and Engineering is foreign students. If companies who need to hire someone to do the coding, I do not believe they can easily find an american to take the job. For one thing, few americans are interested in studying the STEM majors since it is really hard to learn and need strong math background; For another, even though they study the major, few of them really want to take the job since the STEM job is hard and boring. That's why STEM job is popular among foreigners. It is not because the OPT extension or companies do not want to hire americans, it is because that few americans want to do the job in that field, but there have to be someone to do the job. So I do not think an OPT extension will bring any harm to the americans. If they do not want to study the major and do the Job, just let others who want to do the job do it. It is the free competitive market, and the result is because of the market power. Since market made its choice, the best way is to support it. Actually, Even in the NON-STEM major, most graduated people are also from foreign countries. If US keep them away, it will a waste of the education resources. I do not think it will do any good to the US economy, the US education and even the US future by keep a strict immigration policy. DON'T FORGET HOW US IS BUILT!
