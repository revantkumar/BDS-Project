Think about the number of international students in the US top universities. These students are of high potential to make solid, if not huge, contribution to US economy, technology and many other fields. Being not able to offer these highly skilled, ambitious and hard-working talents the opportunity to work in the very first a couple of years in US will lead to not only the loss of US industry/academia, but the loss of US competency over other countries on a global scale.
