Dazhou Guo Please let F-1 non-immigrant students have 24-month OPT extension. I support this rule for several reasons from my own perspective:
1) According to U.S. Census 2013 data, 1.68 percent of Americans over the age of 25 have a PhD. As a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate myself, who will graduate the next year, would appreciate more time to practice and further my skills after graduation. So that I can contribute to the U.S. for a longer time. 

2) University provides me an opportunity to study in the U.S. for FREE, I think it would be right for me to return the favor. I think it would benefit the country as well as myself.
