I strongly support the OPE extension policy for F1 students.

I, myself, benefits from the policy. I, a boy just over 18, came to the US to expand my view to the other side of the world. Without my parents, I spent my first 7 year after becoming an adult in the US, learning as a determined student, as a diligent worker. People at my age are not always know where we will be in 20 years. But having the opportunity to choose is one of the major reason why I choose to come to the US in the first place. 

With OPT and OPT extension, I get a chance to learn and see how American balance work and life where as in China and India, people are facing more and more pressure from work as the economy development is in a rapid pace. I can also involve more in the US as people around me changed from students to people with different age and background. I had conversations about how to enjoy a retirement life and conversations about how to choose a better insurance plan for a second child. I have never thought about these questions before as a college student. From these conversations, I can see deeper and clearer about this country and lead my think about my country. Learning has never stopped and I am fascinated about it. 

A lot of students stayed and got the job here in the US are different from 10 or 20 years ago. Before, some of the students have to stay here otherwise they won`t fit in the own country after so many years aboard. But nowadays with the globalization, most of them choose to stay when they can be appreciate back in their country also. They stay may be for their parents or future kids. They are highly educated and their salary and family funding always assured that they can enjoy themselves.

The OPT and extension is more than a bridge between the US and other countries but also a symbol of the US to all the students.
