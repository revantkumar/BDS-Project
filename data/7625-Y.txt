He Doris I totally support this rule! 

The challenge to the OPT visas was brought, in part, based on concern by some parties that the OPT system places technology professionals born outside of the United States at a competitive advantage over U.S. born professionals. Instead, the OPT program should be viewed as a method to protect the significant investment made by commercial enterprises and the United States government in STEM education programs.

The OPT system helps to ensure that students educated through American STEM programs ultimately apply their skills and education in the United States. Forced repatriation of OPT visa holders is unfair to the individuals involved, and it wastes the substantial U.S. resources invested in the education of those students. The Department of Homeland Security should act immediately to satisfy the requirements of the court to ensure that extended OPT visas remain valid
