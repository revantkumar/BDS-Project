I strongly support the approval of this policy! As a fact, U.S. are accepting more foreign students from all over the world in recent years. The American universities provide a large amount of the education resources to the foreign students, including the theoretical knowledge, technical skills, professional guidance and the opportunities of part-time jobs in campus. As a results, the foreign students can learn so much knowledge as well as practical skills to be a perfect candidates for the American companies after graduation. If the OPT extension policy can be approved, it would be a great chance for American companies to hire talents in different technical areas and then develop soon, especially for the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. As we know, U.S. don't have enough native professionals in these special area. Without all these foreign students, the relevant companies can't develop with a high speed. Sometime, a part of great foreign students can worked as teacher assistants or research assistants with great salary and scholarship. If all these great foreign students just go back to their own counties soon after graduation, it would be a huge waste of the talents and the investments for the American government. Keeping all these talents stay at U.S. and make contributions to the American development would be the only wise choice.
