I am strongly in favor of getting this law (STEM OPT Extension) passed by Department of Homeland Security. It will give international students an opportunity to work in United States and gain certain experience out of what they study in field of Science, Technology, Engineering etc. This will at least give us an opportunity to compete with all valuable candidates. I hope people will understand and support this law.
