I agree with the expanding. 
First of all, as per my view, many international STEM students come to America to seek higher education is because of our beneficial policy. If we terminate this policy, I am afraid of seeing a decline in the amount of incoming international students, which will result in a great lose of elites and education income.
Also, our universities have spent so many efforts to train STEM students. They learned our technology, and gained advanced skills. I think it is good time for them to make contribution to American society after they acquired their degrees. Since STEM subjects are really good for boosting the development of human beings.
Hereby, I sincerely wish that American government can approve the extension of the Optional Practical Training for STEM students.
