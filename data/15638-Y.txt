I strongly support the proposal with the following reasons:

1. the continuous booming of US economy needs these foreign students who are strong with technological backgrounds. 

2. United States is immigration country. An open policy for good-qualified foreign students can show the world who you are. 

3. Competition always exist. Without foreign students, local american still have competition. What is important is a healthy competition where all the people, treated equally, to compete boundless of nationalities. Such competition, regardless of color, race and nationalities will promote knowledge sharing. And knowledge is always power and weapon for a country. 

4. The portfolio of foreign students is well composed of students from China, India and some other developing countries. As these developing countries is booming in economy, they hope to incentisize the economy with generations of students who are equipped with great knowledge by studying abroad. From a US standpoint, in a long term, sending these well-equipped students back home right away is NOT a wise option. They will be messengers, only to boom their home country's economy. 

Given the reasons above, I strongly support the 24 months extension for foreign students.
