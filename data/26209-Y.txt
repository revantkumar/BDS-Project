What makes USA be attractive to every other friends around the world? I believe one of factors is the technology. Every year we can find a new iPhone published. And every two weeks we can find a updated Facebook app. Who makes everyone enjoy these? Although I don't know the percentage of the foreigners spending their lives into industry and academic, we can hardly enjoy those innovative products without their effort. For the more friendly USA and for the better USA, that would no harm to offer them chances to stay.
