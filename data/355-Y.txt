This proposal is a great opportunity for both U.S. and international students. The United States is a well-developed country consisting of diverse people who contribute to the economic environment and all kinds of industries. The interactions and cooperation between domestic and international workers stimulate the improvement of the country and also help international students contribute to their own countries. Many Americans afraid that this proposed regulation will increase the difficulties for them to find a job and will also lower their salaries. However, the employers are supposed to choose candidates based on their capabilities rather than their nationalities. The regulation will actually motivate domestic students to enhance their abilities to be more competitive in the global labor market. Additionally, OPT extension is a non-immigration rule. The students participating in OPT plan to go back to their own countries after finishing training. Hence, they will not threaten the employment of domestic workers.
