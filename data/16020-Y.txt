I strongly support the expanding OPT for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degree. It's American's spirit. For more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed immigrants and refugees from around the world into our nation, enhancing our diversity, culture, and economy. Today, many individuals contributing to the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are immigrants or refugees, and research indicates that skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans. If the OPT of STEM can not be expanded, it will be a shock for U.S. economy. The international students get well training from U.S. however could not contribute U.S. economy, that is a grate loss of U.S.
