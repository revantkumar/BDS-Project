Dear Sirs,

We are in complete accord and fully align ourselves with the judicious comments of Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa: 

"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years - the same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be valid - there is LITTLE DOUBT that the Administration has administratively established a de facto SHADOW H-1B program, in VIOLATION of CONGRESSIONAL INTENT."

This White House seems to believe it can act, sua sponte, as recklessly as it sees fit, and all without any due deference, whatever, to the Constitution, the Congress or existing statutory authorities.

Such belief is as fundamentally flawed, and as would be this proposed administrative whimsy.

Follow the EXISTING law, and nothing more!
