I am an F-1 student pursuing my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University, SC. Over the last 5 years I have gained a significant expertise and published lot of papers, contributing the scientific progress being made in this country. I feel that having this new rule, which would allow me to extend my OPT by 24 months, will be extremely beneficial. As I work in the industry and apply my knowledge to solve industrial problems, I believe that I am contributing to the societal and industrial progress of this great country. The new rule would permit me to do my part to take this nation ahead technologically.
