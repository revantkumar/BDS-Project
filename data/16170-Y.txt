OPT rule is great! For everyone in US. Don't say us workers cannot find a job. Who's problem is that? The society needs better worker, not lazy workers not improving themselves to get a job. Right?

I think OPT extension is not a threat to the US and US citizens, but rather a benefit for exactly the US universities, companies, economy(and therefore for each individual.) Particularly, this very ruling is exactly out there to address people's concerns about abusing the OPT program and to make sure the OPT program will not become a drain for US jobs.
