Vicky Ahlawat I support the rule but i'd like to suggest few changes/additions. Because of less time remaining, I'll write it to the point with eloborating.
1. Crack down on the consultanting firms who bulge up freshers' resume and send them as 6-7 years experience. It's very common practice and unethical and they openly mention it over call. Such consultants shouldn't be eligible for 12-month opt, leave alone giving stem extension, if you really intent to help international students from suffering.

2. Remove the clause of getting the job within 90-days or leave the country. Throughout the graduation an international student is always worried about whether he/she will a job within 90-days. That's the main reason students get exploited by these unscrupulous consultants, it doesn't allow a person to explore the possibility of starting something new or think independently. It's gets depressing and insane, and to be on safe side they join consultants.
