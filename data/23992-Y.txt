From my personal point of view (as an international graduate student researching in applied mathematics), improving and expanding the training opportunities for F-1 Students would 100% benefit both agents --- U.S. governments/citizens and the F-1 students. 

This is a win-win situations because of the following reasons:
1) it will improve the positive competition between the US citizens and students from all over the world, increase the degree of internationalization and creativity of the states.
2) As an immigrant country, this will keep the country alive by imbuing new blood into the society. Expanding the OPT does not directly mean providing more word opportunities to the foreign student. Everyone is equally treated, and the outstanding ones will win the offer. This is one of the ways to make the country stay creative and competitive.
3) It will benefit foreign students since they can directly apply what they have learned into practice, at the same place where they earned the degree.

One piece of note, I earned my bachelor's degree in Singapore, that is a place where the government deliberately introduce strong competitions for their native students by providing tons of scholarships for students from China, India, South East Asia and etc. Working in Singapore after they graduated is strongly recommended and even required to do so.
