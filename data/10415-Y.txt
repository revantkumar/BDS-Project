Strongly support this proposal. Since STEM students will contribute a lot of taxes after graduation. STEM students are most likely to join in technical industries and likely to have a relatively high wage (above average, due to market circumstances). Ensuring OPT extension for STEM students can be beneficial to the U.S. federal taxes. If OPT period is only 12 months the industries will unlikely to employ international students but if just select from citizens their pool of potential employee will reduce a lot. So it is more difficult for these large scale businesses (especially IT industries like Google and Facebook) to hire new employees. Moreover, lots of current employees in these companies are OPT or OPT extension students. If OPT extension is cancelled these people will be forced to leave but the transition and hiring will be a huge problem. That may cause enormous economic losses. Last, STEM OPT attracts more international students and they pay tuitions and living expenditures in the U.S, which stimulates the U.S. economy.

And for the concerns that these STEM students grab work opportunities from U.S citizens, I don't think it is true. Since for most working opportunities no matter STEM or not citizens are first to be employed and last to be unemployed. Additionally, STEM opportunities have qualifications. In every society who meet these qualifications are more likely to be minorities. I don't think everyone can be qualified for these jobs if all STEM OPT students are forced to leave. If so, the companies which might have great losses in benefits will move to overseas, which will do harm to the competence and taxes in the U.S.
