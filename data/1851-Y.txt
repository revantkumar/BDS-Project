Karon Persons Most American College students are under the misconception that if they study hard and make the grades, there will be a job to apply for when they graduate. They are now sadly learning, that the foreign students/H1B Visa holders are getting preferential treatment in the hiring for available U.S. jobs. They are learning that the practice of hiring cheap foreign labor and the tax breaks that come with it, are more of a hiring incentive, than the "degree" of our U.S. college graduates. That finding full-time career employment would become a job in itself. That they too would become part of the statistics of another college graduate unable to pay back their student loan. Our college policies are based on non-discrimination. Yet, the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program appears to be discriminating against our own American college graduates! OPT needs to be stopped immediately.
