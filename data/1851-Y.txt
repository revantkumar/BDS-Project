I strongly support the proposal for following reasons.

OPT Extension can accelerate the development of the industry, stimulate innovation,and store energy for future development. 

Known for the high quality education, diversity of the society, and advanced development in science & technology, a large number of outstanding, honest, hardworking international students are attracted to US. They will be such a strong force in contributing to the the development of US. 

Competition does exists, there is sufficient protection for US citizens, such as some big companies don't even recruit international students. It's a big disadvantage for international students.
