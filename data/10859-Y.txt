I think it is a good news, no matter for the USA or international students. First of all, STEM degree students are those who have more knowledge and may do more contribution to the society. With longer OPT, they can do more job for the USA. Secondly, a lot of companies really need technical staffs but hard to find in the USA. Using the OPT can give them more change to practice international students and find out the people they need. Thirdly, more and more people are applying for the H1B visa and it makes the international students stay here harder and harder, so if the OPT time is not long enough for them to win the lottery, they may leave the USA directly and that would cause STEM talents run away.
So in my opinion, it is very important to extent to STEM OPT. And even more, why not give them the H1B visa without the lottery? The USA need them and they want to work for the USA, they can make more contribution to the society in that way!
