Jeska Meinema I support the new rule. International students with STEM degrees have made huge contributions to the US econnomy for last five years. Also the US Department of Labor reported that there's still a shortage of workers in STEM fields, and the demands for technology and science talents will increase till 2020. I've been working in oil & gas field for several years, from my observation, the length of a development project could be at least three years, from the setting up, exploring to exploiting. 24 months isn't long enough for students in STEM fields to get trainning and finish a project, and the OPT needs extended a little more than what we have right now.
