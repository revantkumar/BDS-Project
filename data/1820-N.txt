OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheeper) than their American competitions. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range but they cost Social security about $2 billion dollars a year . This is not good for U.S citizens.
