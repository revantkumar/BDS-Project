Comment:
I think the extension is not only necessity but a future trend. It is the most talented people, regardless of their race, beliefs, nationalities, that make this country prosperous. The greatness of US is not its economy, its military, but its tolerance. With the extension of OPT, there are at least 3 benefits.

1 Capture the most talented person, they are working for US and are paying a significant amount of tax, only with the help of whose US can maintain the technology leader position all around the world

2 Stimulate the marked for studying in US. Without the OPT extension, there would be a decrease in numbers of STEM students come to US for a higher level of education which had already brought much profit for US universities.

3 Companies will have a hard time seeking great candidates to work for them, which is bad for startup companies who are not that competitive. It is a pity if these potential companies closed for that reason
