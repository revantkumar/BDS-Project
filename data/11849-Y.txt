I definitely approve of Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT). Foreign students need time to accumulate experience after their graduation, especially for those STEM students. U.S. has the best resources in both academic and industrial fields, which all STEM students desire. OPT is a part of education programs, and the students' leaving without enough OPT may lead to the imperfection and debasing the quality of education. Furthermore, OPT does not guarantee foreign students to stay in U.S. after that. A great number of students go back to their motherlands for better careers after OPT. Expansion of OPT will not deteriorate job competition.

Immigrants make this country great, and the expansion of OPT is not even an immigration act. The door should not be closed so tightly to foreign students at the cost of something more valuable.
