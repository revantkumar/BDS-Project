To Whom It Way Concern,

I strongly support this proposal, for mainly the following reasons:

1) Unlike uneducated or illegal non-immigrant employees, F1 students with STEM degrees have made, are making and will certainly make huge contributions to this country.These people came to the U.S. with no background, no contact, English as their second language, they worked hard and proved their talent and capability in the fields they study in. It is against the so called human right and radial equality which I assume this country believes in.

2) People like me and most of my friends works in high-tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. after graduation with OPT. Frankly speaking, for those full-time employees in such companies, I highly doubt if failure on this proposal will actually kick them out of American job market. Maybe some of them will just be transferred to another location for one or two years then come back to the U.S. with another status instead of H1B; and for the potential full-times, e.g. interns, contractors, most of them are ideal candidates who these companies paid a lot of time and money to help them grow in an internal environment, thus it will be a great loss to the companies if they cannot keep these people just for their working status.

3) About the worry on minimal wage, I did some research and it basically has nothing to do with us. I believe the average salary of F1 students with STEM degrees are way beyond the minimum. In a word, international students are by no means cheap labor, they invested a huge amount to get the top notch education in the world and they deserve the legal right to work here for a longer term, and it's unreasonable to force them to leave this country right after their graduation: in that case, failure on this proposal will not only harm the profit of most of the high-tech companies, it will cause the loss of incoming international students.
