As an employer, we constantly face similar issues in hiring.

We had one candidate last year for an analyst position. He's a brilliant young guy and also an international student who has limited work authorization time (OPT) left and there is no guarantee that he could obtain his work visa (H1B) due to the uncertainty of the lottery process. He was very well educated and really impressed us during the interview. However, we had to move on to another candidate with unlimited work authorization, who did not do a very good job since his start.

As a business owner myself, I'd rather see brilliant internationals shine in what they do and contribute to our economy. The core value of American dream, for my understanding is, if you are capable of what you do, you gotta shine. (Unless you don't have enough work authorization).

That's the reason I support OPT 24 months extension.
