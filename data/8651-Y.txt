I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

1. The foreign students study very hard, especially the international people with STEM major, they helped a lot in the industry, lots of them became the leading character in the industry. they contributed tramendous growth to the USA economy

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S

3. there is no such thing that international students don't pay taxes, that's illegal and we won't let it happen.

4. As an international student, we don't get paid lower than American citizen, the amount we get paid are based on our experiences
