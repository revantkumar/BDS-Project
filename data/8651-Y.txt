Priya Ravikumar I welcome most part of this new rule as it will help all the international students on STEM programs to work and utilize their skills in an efficient way. However, most of the international students are qualified individuals with many years of experience including myself hence i think treating them like freshers in the job market with training / mentoring plans is unnecessary. There is a higher chance that employers will consider this as a burden / additional effort when they make a decision to hire a international student. 

Otherwise I am 100% supportive to the proposed rule.
