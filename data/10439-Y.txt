This new policy is super helperful, it could help more and more people, especially F-1 students to work and improve themselves after graduation. And nowadays there are lots of people with OPT status working in US, they are super valuable for lots of companies, like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and they deserve to continue to work longer in US if they are not selected in H1B lottery. I totally support this new OPT extension rule, which is even better the old one.
