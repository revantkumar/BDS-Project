I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal, because:

1) Most international student are excellent, especial for the students getting a job in US. US government didn't pay any tuition fee for these excellent students, they learned advanced knowledge from the universities of US, if keep them contributed to US government, the big winner must be US country!

2) Almost all the countries welcome the students go back their homeland with the advanced knowledge, this is a invisible competition. Refused this propose is just speeding US lose this war.

3) Some people think these students "steal" their job. This is totally wrong. Why US is so strong in the word, because US always like challenge, keep excellent people to develop new technology as leader. Competition is not bad thing, it will keep people diligent and smart, make country stronger and rich. This propose absolutely is very helpful for America keeping lead in the word.
