Middle class is dying... And you want to invite anyone else in to make it worse! We need good jobs... Jobs period. Have you ever considered helping out the American people... The real American people... Not just the entitlement crowd that don't want the responsibility of a job? I am sick and tired of an administration who is committed to everyone BUT Americans.
