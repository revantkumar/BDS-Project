I support this rule. 

First, OPT extension doesn't mean foreign student will take jobs away from US citizens. It only gives foreign students a platform to demonstrate their ability. The companies will choose the right people they need. If the companies have more choices, they have better chance to grow up fast and create more jobs. 

Second, it might be hard to see. But the truth is that immigrants are creating jobs for the US. They eat in the US, which creates jobs in restaurant. They buys cloths in the US, which creates jobs in clothing store. They pay taxes when they buy things or services. 

This rule gives foreign students, American companies and American society more choices to win.
