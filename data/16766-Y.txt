I believe America is the most open-minded country in this world, and thanks to that, America could recover rapidly from the financial crisis since 2008. Everyone here can say what they want to say.

I am in a big company myself, and I can see how the STEM major international people suffer from their status. They work as hard as they can, contributing to the economy. I certainly doubt that how the companies could recruit qualified people after we exile those contributors. And I have a serious concern about those companies' future.

Looking deep into who are messing up this rule, I don't see a reasonable comment, maybe they are just angry about economy and want to find a place to yell. But in my experience, wealth is created by hardworking, not negative emotion.
