To whom may concern,

I would like to submit this comment to support this Proposed Rule. The reasons are following:

1, USA has the biggest and most advantage High-Tech market in the world, this is the only place students can be trained well and learn the advanced technology. Therefore, the rules create huge opportunities for students to practice, learn and work their knowledge. This also means US market is more competitive than other globe market.If not, the students will choose other job opportunities in other countries. 
2, The STEM related workforce need is huge. As long as the digital economic growth, US has a huge need of STEM skilled workers. I don't know the market #, but if you go to indeed.com etc, you can find tons of jobs related with STEM. The workforce need is there and I think this will be not harmful for US High-Tech workforce. On the opposite, this will enhance the high-tech workforce for US.
3,This will continue contribute economic values for US such as education tuition, restaurant, cars spent, apartment rent,transportation(international flights), vacations(family),Medical need, innovation/patents in job area etc.All these activities during the extension period will contribute to the growth of US Economy.

Above all, I think this rule will support the U.S.economy by implementing it and also benefits the students. 

thanks
