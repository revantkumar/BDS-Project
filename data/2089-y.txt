Xinyu Min I'm an international student in US holding F1 visa. I am pursuing my PhD degree in Industrial Engineering and Operation Research. I'll graduate next year. I'm in support of STEM OPT extension. 

The STEM OPT extension means a lot to me, because all of my five years' research are all about applied math, which requires a close connection between industry and academic work. With the STEM OPT extension, I would have enough time to transform the theories I've learned in school into practical solutions in the industry, so that I could gain experience and develop my career. 

Moreover, the STEM OPT extension will benefit a lot of US employers. As applied math based technologies currently play an important roles in hi-tech areas, like big data and machine learning field, applied math graduates are in high demand in hi-tech companies. If the STEM OPT extension is not passed, many graduates will be forced out of the US, and US hi-tech companies will lose a huge amount of valuable human resources. In this way, the STEM OPT extension will keep the US companies competitive in the global market, and help recover the US economy since 2009. 

Finally, the STEM OPT extension should be 24 months. STEM related projects usually last a long period. If the extension is too short, many projects will not be finished because the experts in charge of project implementation cannot stay in US any longer. That could cause a huge loss for hi-tech US companies. Thus, the duration of STEM OPT should be extended to 24 months. 

In conclusion, DHS should be supported for implementing the STEM OPT extension rule. Thank you so much for reading this letter. 

Sincerely,
Xinyu
