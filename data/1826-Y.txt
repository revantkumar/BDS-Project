OPT Extension --- one of the greatest factors that STEM students choose US as their study place. 

Many native residents might think that inflow of international students "steal" their jobs and welfare, but from my own experience, this could NOT be far from the truth. Take my company as an example, every new engineer (who is good enough for effort to obtain OPT) creates as least 3 jobs for his/her community. Products cannot be made solely by engineers --- staff in maintenance, supporting are also needed as well (which are mainly hired from local residents). At the same time, real-estate asset holders will benefit a lot from prospering hi-tech companies in local area. This is nearly the only way in which US could remain its dominance in innovation &&technology!!!

From the point of "identity", some opponents might argue by stating that "American identity" is worthless because OPT-Extension students are treated well. How ridiculous it is!!! No company would hire a person unless this person behaves "better" than others, or this company would go bankruptcy. the United States is different from many other countries because of its competition and openness. OPT-extension actually brings this "spirit" into real-world execution. American identity becomes more valuable for intellectuals flowing into this country, bring up asset prices (stocks, real-estate asset, etc), making everyone's life wealthier and happier than ever before. Otherwise, US will be no different from North Korea in many aspects...
