I agree with the proposal. The student who is holding a F1 visa, should have a opportunity to get a intership, it is good to the US society and the F1 students. It is a win-win proposal. All those student will make benefit to the society, they need to consume when they are doing intership, and they make money for the company. In big picture, allow F1 students to extend their OPT is good to the economy.
In the other hand, just like the declaration of independence says, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." In my view, both of us are pursuiting happiness, F1 students are doing the work which american does NOT want to do, like Construction, Coding, and many other tough work. As a result, this proposal should be allowed.
