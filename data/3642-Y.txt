Qiyu Hu As a current Google employee on F-1 visa, I strongly support the extension.

A considerable number of the software engineers here, at Google, are immigrants from countries in Asia, and East Europe. They make a huge contribution to the company. The two most profitable products here, Adwords and Adsense, contain a large amount of work by those engineers. Besides, they also offer unique and profound insight into the development process during the internationalization of Google products. Foreign engineers play an irreplaceable role here, at the search giant.
