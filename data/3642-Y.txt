I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. International Students majoring in STEM WILL NOT let job market be more competitive, and won't influence native American's job welfare and salary. STEM major related work need higher education and expertise in Science and technology, fewer American are in that job market. IT NEVER INFLUENCE American's job. Different fields! 
Moreover, companies need more talents!!!
