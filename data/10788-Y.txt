I strongly support this proposed rule, which expands training opportunities for F-1 students because this represents the spirit of freedom and equity, which are deeply rooted in the culture of the United States.

These spirits are the fundamentals to the flourishing and prosperity of the United states for the past hundreds of years: all men are created equal and thus should be judged solely by their merits and efforts but not by their place of birth or ethnicity. I see no reason why F-1 students should be discriminated compared with U.S. citizens in the job market because we pay no less taxes, contribute to U.S. economy with our own consumption and serve our living communities the same as U.S. citizens.

In addition, from a pragmatic perspective, STEM F-1 students mainly search for high-tech positions after graduation. The high-tech job market in U.S. can never be satisfied by U.S. citizens only (e.g. please check the roster in silicon valley companies or ask their human resource department). Therefore, extension of training opportunities will not influence much of U.S. citizen employment but instead can boost the high-tech economy in U.S.

I hope the policy-makers can recognize these aspects and make the right decision for the future of America!
