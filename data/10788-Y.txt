Mass Mail Campaign 118 Gui Ge (Total as of 11/19/2015: 2) I am an international students, I think OPT extension gives us a good opportunity to apply what we have learnt here to the industry and help us to strengthen our knowledge, it is a good practice and an essential part of the education.

Practicing helps me to become more experienced and after I go back to my home country, I can be more competitive. OPT extension is one of the major factor that I make the decision to study in US, if this act is canceled, I think a large portion of students will not come to this country to study. 

I strongly support OPT extension.
