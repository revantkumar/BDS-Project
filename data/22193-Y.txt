I know these guys (F1 STEM) are excellent students and some of them are my good friends. They went through difficulties to adjust the life here in the states and got their degrees. They are smart and could absolutely contribute to our country! 

I want to say that they are not illegal immigrants. They paid higher tuition than us, and they hold legal visa to pursue their education here. They could choose their future on their own.

Guys, stop complaining that these people steal your jobs. They will be your leaders some day and you are still complaining! Shame on you!
