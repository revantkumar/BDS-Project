I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:
Diversity has always played an important role since the very beginning of this country. It's an incorporation of people from all ethnics, race, and nationalities. So it should be the same for immigrants and citizens. The fact that OPT got extended is a great way to enhance this.
Also, it will greatly boost the economy since the new policy would attract more international students to stay and work in the States.
I noticed that there's some objection comments here, concerning that the increase of non-immigrants will take away citizen's job. To my knowledge, competition has always been a good thing for everyone. Also, we're in an era full of opportunities. There's thousands and hundreds of start-ups and businesses rising up to success every single day. I believe this policy will benefit the citizens the same if not more than the non-immigrants.
