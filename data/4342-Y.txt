I strongly support this proposal. Those who oppose the plan are very short-sighted on the contribution from foreign STEM students. I see now they are trying to expel the group that made most contributions to America's economy out of this country.
A lot many startup companies are growing these days. Our company has tripled its size last year. Think about how many job opportunities have been created then? All these are inseparable from graduated foreign students. If there isn't these many candidates on the job market, there simply wouldn't be so many chances for startup companies to grow. Reducing competition would be a very bad idea for America to maintain its strength in high tech fields.
I have also read some comments saying immigrates got jobs because they are willing to live a cheap live without dignity. This is simply slandering and definitely not true for foreign STEM students as most high tech companies pay new grad employees way above the average salary in America, and most of them they can easily afford the rent of a middle-class apartment. They won the job simply because they outperform other people, including natives. Meanwhile, with their salary, think about how much contribution could they make to the local economy? And, with their different cultural backgrounds and economical needs, how many initiatives and creations would be sprung up in the local living, catering and traveling economy?
Relax the limitation on foreign students and keep attracting talents all around the globe!
