What this country needs is for you to follow and enforce the laws we have now. As a citizen, I am tired of this lawless administration and their minions who think they can do whatever they want against the will of the people.

Not only am I concerned about my tax dollars being wasted on illegal aliens who have broken the law of this country, but the fact that Americans are being by passed by these illegals at our nations colleges. When illegals get government paid tuition but American students pay outrageous prices there is a problem.

You continue to lie to the people saying "As with the current 17-month STEM OPT extension, the proposed rule would authorize STEM OPT extensions only for students employed by employers enrolled in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS') E-Verify employment eligibility verification program", But we all know that is not the the truth.

The truth is that this program has taken away 430,00 jobs from Americans and has also taken 4 Billion dollars away from Social Security. That money was and should have been the Cost-of-Living-raise for those already receiving SS. It is a lie from this administration that we have no inflation, therefore no raise for these recipients and "We the People" know it.

I demand that until you enforce the immigration laws on the books that no illegal gets any additions in the visas. These people are a weight to America at a time when America needs jobs. They pay no FICA or Medicare taxes and is only a boon for big business while American Workers get the shaft. STOP THE MADNESS!!!
