Joanne Marshall International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. Americans who engaged with international students while on campus are more likely in later life to appreciate art and literature, place current problems in historical perspective and read or speak a foreign language as per survey from duke university. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity. This suggestion will not only give the F-1 students more time to win the H1B lottery but also will increase the revenue of US companies specially in tech and engineering fields significantly. This is essentially great help to US economics growth.
