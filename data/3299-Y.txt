The OPT extension is definitely beneficial for the development of economy and technology in U.S. It attracts many talented foreign students to gain their work experience here and contribute their effort to high tech industry. Some people are worried about losing their work opportunity. First, OPT extension is only for STEM students and most of the students in those majors are foreigners. Those STEM students will only work in corresponding industries as well which are limited and will not affect other work opportunities. Second, not all of the foreign students will stay after the OPT extension and many of them go back to their own countries because of their family and friends. Lastly, the OPT extension will bring competition for jobs but competition is the core of America culture and it is the motivation of economy. The competition will lead to a better future of U.S. Thanks
