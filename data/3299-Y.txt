Sree Harsha Subraveti I am in favor of extending the OPT for F-1 students. F-1 students contribute a lot to the research at University. It is very well documented rule to extend the OPT. STEM students gain expertise in their fields before returning to their home countries. 
Also given the scenario of H-1 visa, this is the only way to retain the brain drain and benefit both individuals and organisations and in turn the country's economy. I believe the contributions of F-1 students who finish their higher education in US to contribute their technical expertise to the society will be hampered if this rule is not allowed. 
I favor this rule as this is very important to country both in terms of economic reasons and technological reasons.
