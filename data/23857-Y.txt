If Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees is improved and expanded, more international students will be attracted to study abroad in United States. The more international students come to U.S., the more benefits local residents get.
First, more international students means that the universities could get more tuition fee which can be used to improve the university environment and facilities. Also this income can be used to hire more capable professors and enhance academic quality.
Second, more international students means increasing housing demands. When international students study on the campus, they need to rent a house or an apartment in the university neighborhood. Most of the landlords of those properties are local residents, and more international students bring them more incomes.
Third, more international students creates more job opportunities. International students buy grocery from supermarkets; they eat at restaurants; they booked flight tickets and hotel when they are on Spring break and Summer vacation. All of the above would create more job opportunities for the local residents.
In a nutshell, if the government could improve and expand Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees, studying in U.S. would be more attractive so that more international students will come to U.S. and bring more benefits to local residents.
