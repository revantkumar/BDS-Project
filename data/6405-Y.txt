The 24 month extension of F-1 OPT for STEM graduates is vital not only for the thousands of STEM graduates from US universities but also for thousands of employers across the US. The international students on F-1 OPT form the highly skilled, much required professional work-force in a significant number of US and multinational companies. These STEM graduates bear a significant impact on the situation of all the companies who currently require their expertise, and therefore on the US economy itself. I therefore sincerely commend the commitment of DHS to propose the new rule on time. 

However, the new additional requirement of the "mentorship and training program" for the STEM extension is too stringent a rule. It burdens DSO with added duties, creates too much paperwork for the student as well as the employer. 
Also, this discourages employers from taking advantage of the tremendous potential of skilled graduates simply because of 1. The additional weight of the paper work associated with them and 2. ICE's visits to check on the employers and employees! 

The US is known to be a land of opportunities. By helping the international students and companies employing them, the US helps her own economy, thus creating more jobs and opportunities. Helping internationals does not mean taking an American's job away. It simply helps everyone by flourishing the entire economy!
