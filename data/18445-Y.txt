I strongly support the proposal that extend the OPT period by 24 months for the following reasons:
1.It will allow more talented international students with degrees contribute for American's economy and technology advancement.
2.It will attract more international students to study in US through providing chance for them to apply their skills and knowledge gained from colleges into practical work, help colleges and universities get diversified and insightful thoughts in research development. 
3.It demonstrates that United States provide equal chance for everyone to get a job without regard to race and national origins, proves United States is a free and equal country.
4.It will increase foreign revenues and boost economy by tourism and shopping through inviting their relatives to visit US.
