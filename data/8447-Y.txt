I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. As you can see, most foreign students who stay in the U.S. are keeping contributing to this country, so their power and achievements are unneglectable.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S., 

3. The U.S. is a country who is willing to embrace students around the world as long as they can make contribution to this society. This property has been rooting in the soil of the liberty.

4. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. If someone are trying to get out of the competition, then he/she will definitely become weaker and weaker, and finally he/she will be cleaned out by this society, so the only way to survive is to compete with others and enforce ourselves to become stronger and stronger.
