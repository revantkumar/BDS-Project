I strongly support this rule. People do come from other countries, but they contribute greatly to US's economic development. Years ago, people came from World wide and united, resulting in today's prosperous. Today US is facing the same issue and that is a great chance. Besides, I guess some of those who extremely hates the rule are likely to do worse in jobs and talented foreign people become a threaten to them.
