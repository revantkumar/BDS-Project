I strongly agree with expanding OPT for F-1 students since most of them have high professional background which is super helpful for the development of U.S.. Also, with the competition of those nonimmigrant students, the overal quality of native students will improve quickly. We don't want to lose such large amount of high-quality labors and elites to construct our great nation.
