The New OPT extension will be a good policy.
First, it will keep the United States academy schools competitive in the world. As we know, more and more counties, like Canada, British, are taking international students to develop their education industry. The 24 months extension will be a great benefit for the STEM talents and attract more students coming USA for education. Those talents will be great assets for the USA to develop high technology and keep competitive position in the world. 
Second, the 24 months give more time for company to finish a research or a project. Currently, the duration of a research or a project is usually 2 years or longer. 1 year OPT is not enough for students to finish the research. For a company, they need to hire new person to continue the research which is really a cost wasting. So those technology companies and research institutions really need the new OPT extension to fill the talent gap.
