Du Cui As an international student in one private Midwest private college, I firmly believe that expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students will create a win-win situation for United States and various international communities in the U.S. 
Given the context of internationalism in the current world, it's not rational for the U.S. to close its door. The student concerned in this act would all be great architects in various aspects of the U.S. society. Actually, the underlying reason of America's prosperity is that it has been inviting outstanding individuals from various backgrounds to work together on the same land. Diversity yields glory. If me and my generation all go back to China, India, Mexico, Pakistan, etc., the status quo international position of U.S. may not be the same within 30 years. 
On a micro basis, increasing number of international student will provide more competition in the labor market, which will stimulate the domestic population to excel. Eventually a benificient cycle will be formed.
