I support the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule. U.S. is so strong nowadays because those who are creative and work hard. There is no reason to reject talent people to U.S. for a long term purpose. And for those comments saying that international students took too many working position, I would say even those companies don't hire an international student, they won't hire someone that is not qualified.
