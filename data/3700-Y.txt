I strongly support the OPT extension for students with STEM degrees for the following reason:

Educational institutions need international students to compete in the global race for research talent.
A huge amount of international students will take the OPT extension into consideration when they intent to pursue a STEM degree in the U.S. or Canada, Japan, Germany.
My friends in high school from Germany choose to go home for college because they were afraid the 17 months OPT extension was definitely too short for them to finish a proper project in any laboratory or go home to be considered experienced worker/researcher.
The 24 months OPT extension will attract more intelligent international students and better ensure that the U.S academic sector can remain competitive globally.
