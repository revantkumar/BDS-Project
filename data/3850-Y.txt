Jade Hong, UC Berkeley I strongly agree with this extension proposal. The equal opportunity for every one makes US the best country in the world. It's easy to figure out more than 80% of STEM major students are from other countries who need OPT extension. And those people are only the resources for US industry to hire for IT/quantitative jobs. Since Most natives are not study STEM programs, IT/financial service industry prefer hiring internationals with stem background. And there won't be an increase in employment rate for natives even if internationals do not compete with them since industry only need the best fit.
