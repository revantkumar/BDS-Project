I SUPPORT this proposal. International STEM students are NOT competing with American students for job opportunities; increase OPT extension time would not cause a rise in unemployment rate.

I'm an electrical engineering student at a university in the Midwest. I've enrolled in the ECE program for 3 years and I've been a teaching assistant since 2015 spring.
From my experience, I found the engineering school is much smaller than the business school in terms of enrolled students, but there are more international students in our engineering school. And, I found American students might take circuit courses but seldom select more advanced ECE classes, such as, electrical machines, power system analysis. In fact, most students in these courses are international. 
Basically, the STEM international students are looking for job opportunities requiring high level of expertise, which most native students are not interested in. And, I don't think the few native master students in our department have a hard time in finding jobs. The native graduates from our lab all went to good companies like Vishay Dale Electronics, National Instruments.

International STEM students actually do NOT take American students' jobs. The STEM jobs taken by the international students is simply that companies cannot find a native candidate with required expertise. Thus, increase OPT extension time would not cause a rise in unemployment rate.
