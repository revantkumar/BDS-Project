I totally support the proposal. The reasons are following.1. It's no doubt that the international students who are studying STEM majors are valuable to the US economy. US needs those student to make contribution to its development of science and technology. 2.The US economy will be in crisis wihout such a proposal because US cannot sustain its power in science and technology field. In addition, US cannot attract people come to US to get education which push the growth of US economy.3. The people who are against this proposal because they are afraid of job competition. However, competition is always the good thing for the country and economy. We need competition to make our life better.
