There is a discussion for the STEM OPT extension for a while. In my opinion, it is a good thing to extend it! Regardless of immigration factors, the extension is for the sake of human rights! This will offer more chance for foreign students. Consider of the facts that most foreign students lack the human resource and living skills in a new country compare with the native students, we international students NEED much more time to get used to the society in US. What's more, in order to make our contributions with the knowledge we learn here to the society, we NEED much more time to find a job. Thus, I STRONGLY suggest to prove the STEM OPT extension. This is a win-win proposal both for our students and the American society.!
