Giving stem students the opt extension is a remarkable and beneficial idea. I think this is the regulation will increase the comprehensive national strength of US and benefit general people who lives in this country. If we give them 24 month opt, they will have more chances to apply for H1B VISA and stay in US and working for this county. They are very intelligent young people from all over the worlds. With them working at companies in our county, it will certainly increase the competitiveness of US companies in international market.
