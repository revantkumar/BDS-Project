I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

Welcoming talented immigrants is a tradition of America and makes America the best country in the world. The number of international students in STEM is actually not large, but they can contribute a lot in talents, which is crucial to the future of America. The fact that the number of STEM students is limited they're required to work in directly major-related field eases the competition with native American. As the result, the new STEM policy will benefit all American with only a little cost.
