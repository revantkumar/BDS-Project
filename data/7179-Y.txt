Subject: Comments on Proposed Rulemaking - Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,

Docket ID ICEB-2015-0002
RIN: 1653-AA72

Dear Sir or Madam:

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a [[graduate student / international student / describe yourself here!]] at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). 65% of CMU graduate students are international students in the United States on F-1 visas. [[I and/or many of my colleagues]] will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule. 

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM students, and encourage them to make the extension available to all students. Im particularly excited to see the duration of the Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months. 
I am planning to use OPT after graduation to gain some experience in the industry and apply things that I have learnt from my course.

I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension or the ability of students to make use of the STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I applaud the work of the Department of Homeland Security in quickly filling the gap left by the Washington Tech Workers Alliance case. 
The OPT program is an important part of the plant to attract graduate students to the United States. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Best regards,
