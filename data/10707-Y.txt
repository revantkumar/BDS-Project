Ashwin Iyengar The new rule proposed is really well presented, it will be useful for all the international students who have completed their education in USA, it will help us further enhance our skills by allowing us to work for a prolonged period of time in the industrial sector. It will also be beneficial to the United States economy, with such a large population of International Students working in various sectors pumping so much finance will only further stabilize the economy. For so many international students the extended OPT Stem Extension of 24 months is an excellent rule, with the increasing amount of H1B applicants every year this would provide International Students an opportunity to work for a longer period of time and in the process contribute to the US economy even more. I believe it is a win win situation for all, with more capable and smart international students working in good jobs, this will open up new avenues and resources which will be beneficial to the US nationals as well. With the new rule accepted, will encourage other International Students to come to the United States for their higher studies which is again an added incentive.
I kindly request to the committee to consider the new proposal submitted and assert the fact that United States of America truly stands for providing freedom and opportunity for all.
