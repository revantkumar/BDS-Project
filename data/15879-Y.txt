I completely support the 24months STEM. As a international student, we come to the US to persuit the dream. I believe all the STEM students are doing the same thing, they took the better highter eduction, demonstrating their talent which is potentially useful to the development of this country. The STEM majors are not like finance, art and economics, which could bring a sudden short profit. Each progress the in STEM fields needs time accumulation to bring a practical value to this country, no matter smaller ones or bigger ones. I think STEM OPT provides the STEM student an opportunity to make the technologies in this country thrive by keeping using the knowledge they acquired in the US. This is not a proposal for immigration, and doesn't mean that every STEM student will fully use the STEM OPT staying in this country for another 24 months, also I don't know why the people disgree with this proposal didn't do a statistical survey to see what's the contribution the STEM students make and what level work they are doing. I think their argument is focusing on the fact that the STEM students take the native's job opportunities. Well, there is another thing they ignored, which is that they don't have an idea how many STEM students are doing the fancy scientific resarch as postdoc. And how many job opportunities each technology from these scientists' and postdocs' contribution. Also, we do admit the fact that STEM OPT does bring more competitive mechamism to this society, however this is exactly this country thrived since it established, and this is exactly how the STEM brings the evolutional procress to humanbeing, making the USA standing as a leading in the world. So as far as this proposal is concerned, I see this could bring more positive effects than negative ones. In summary, I strongly support the 24months STEM OPT proposal.
