Heng Lyu I strongly support this new rule of OPT extension, the reason is:
US needs a larger tech-savvy workforce, according to USNews(http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real) , because of the shortage of most STEM-oriented occupations, From 2000 to 2013,the salary for workers in computer and mathematical, health care practitioner, engineering, and science occupations rose rapidly. Software developers, for instance, saw salaries soar 26 percent over the same period.There are currently three job vacancies advertised online for every unemployed computer worker.By 2018, there could be 2.4 million unfilled STEM jobs. While jobs overall are expected to grow just shy of 10 percent by 2018, STEM jobs are predicted to grow by 17 percent.

Assume every student pay $200000.00 for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, daily expenses and other. the US is receiving Total $80000000000.00. If extension is cancelled, all these money will go other countries with OPT system.

US Universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT Stem extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months. Most of the US Universities and colleges will shutting their doors if the OPT extension is not given, because student will choose other countries for higher education
According to NAFSAs latest economic analysis,International students and their families created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year. For every 7 international students enrolled, 3 U.S. jobs are created or supported (http://www.nafsa.org/_/File/_/eis2014/USA.pdf) .International students help US build bridges between Americans and other nationalities;Bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs;Support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework, making it possible for U.S. colleges and universities to offer these courses to U.S. students; and Support programming and services on campus for all students by paying out-of-state tuition, funded largely by non-U.S. sources.
