Steven Li I believe that this kind of improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students is really necessary.

Firstly, this decision would give these non-immigrant students more opportunities and time to make contribution to the States. The contribution includes the scientific research and engineering construction. As we know, a lot of new scientific achievements are obtained by these non-immigrant students especially by the STEM students. 

Secondly, diversity is so important for both universities and enterprises in the States. If this new expanding regulation becomes effective, it would attract more foreign students to come to the US to study. This would be really beneficial to the American's economy and university's academia environment. For an enterprise, some foreign students would also help it to keep the international horizon.

Lastly, a lot of job positions are suitable for these students. For some particular industry, the market really need some technical guys and bilingual talented students. If these students do not have the expanding training opportunities, it may cause some social issues even have bad effect on American's economy development. One more thing is that, this kind of competition would really be beneficial to the citizens.
