I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international mathematics PhD student from China and I am applying for a post doc this year. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my PhD degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is the OPT extension allows us to further our research after graduation and make bigger contribution. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. 

I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Mathematical research needs a lot of time. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on projects would lose their VISA before the mathematical problem has even been worked out.

As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.
