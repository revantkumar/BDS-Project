John Sandberg I am in favor of this rule. 

Every year, there are tons of foreigners try to immigrate America, through marriage, employment, family, green card lottery, investment, political persecution, etc. Why? Because America is such a great country with superior freedom and opportunities that many people would realize their American dreams in this promise land. 

America initially was a land full of immigrants from all over the world. The people who get into the bus first, they are not supposed to prevent people from getting on who are as competent as the antecessor and who can also make great contribution to this country. 

Of course, the country should limit the number of people who want to get in this country, based on all kinds of factors such as economic, social, political etc. Some locals would say, those foreigners increase the difficulties of hunting a job in their own country! (Sounds like they are afraid of competition.)

America itself is a country advocates freedom of market and freedom of competition. 

We all know that America suffered the financial crisis during 2008 to 2012. But we also witness the economy of America is booming after these years, with more jobs, increased employment rates, and decreasing unemployment rates! Why? Is it because we have fewer foreigners? Or because the jointed efforts from governments, all kinds of business/companies, international education, global trade and so forth? 

It is not supposed to believe the incurrence of those foreigners has a threat to the employment of locals. There are not only the foreign workers with well-educated stay to contribute to this country, but also it exists illegal foreign workers and some who come from all sorts of channels. 

We should look forward and support those people with high-skilled, well-educated and diverse backgrounds to stay here, because we believe America would become better off with diverse people contributing themselves to the betterment of this homeland!
