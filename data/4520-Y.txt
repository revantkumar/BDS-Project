OPT program for foreign students is causing major harm to the American students and workers as companies are hiring F1 foreign students vs Americans(they save a lot of money in the taxes) OPT extension will increase this huge issue for everyone...Companies will hire F1 students on OPT and will continue to underpay them...so it is not good for foreign students either...OPT program is BAD for America!! It works against American STEM workers
