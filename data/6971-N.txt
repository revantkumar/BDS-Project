When so many of our own college graduates are having a hard time finding
a job this doesn't make any sense. It only helps employers who pay 
foreign students less. 

Please re-think this.


As Sam Rolley of Personal Liberty stated:

"not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them 
from payroll taxes."

"A 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that
there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors."

"Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. 
has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields."

Sincerely,
