I strongly support this rule. In fact industry does need those international students. They have made significant contributions to help the recovery of the economy. If this rule is not passed, industries like IT, finance and engineering will have to take the huge impact of losing employees. I don't think it's wisdom to deny this rule as we still hard to say where the economy will go.
