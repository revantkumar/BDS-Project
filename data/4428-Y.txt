I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for some reasons.

First, the government should give the international student a chance to make contribution by what they have learned from the US universities instead of just learning from the US and make contribution for the other countries.

Second, USA is a migration country so it should allow those people come from other country to make their effort here.

Third, the only way an international student can use their OPT to work in the US is they can do most US citizen cannot do. The international students can make contribution that US citizen cannot. All of those contributions keep making the US a better and more powerful country.

So i believe that OPT extension is a proposal that have more pros than cons.
