I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. The proposed changes would better ensure that STEM students gain valuable practical STEM experience in applying their academic knowledge in a work setting. Students will then be better positioned to begin careers in their fields of study. 

2. The proposed changes would help meet the high demand for workers with degrees in STEM by encouraging talented STEM students beginning careers in the United States. 

3. The proposed changes would help ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States.
