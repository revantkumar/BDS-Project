The OPT policy for international students should be extended and put into effect as soon as possible. I just don't understand why so many american people say that we are using their fund that are supposed to raise their family. We have paid all the tuition that the American students have paid, besides this, we have paid the out-of-the state tuition and we have paid the international students insurance which definitely will be a great part of the income of the insurance company. When we are here, we have to rent the houses, buy the vehicles and buy the food, all these are kind of contribution to the local economy. For example, I'm a Chinese student in America for four years. During the four years, my parents and my different relatives have come to United states to visit me for three times. Each of the three time, they have to travel and buy different gifts for the friends in China. Under my calculation, each time, they have spend no less than 10 thousand dollars. Besides this, during these four years, I've returned back to China four times. Each time, I had to buy so many gifts for relatives. Like, I'm going to return back again to China this Christmas. I've already spend more than 5000 dollars so far. Only in terms of the electric shavers, I've got one Braun-series 7 , one Philips and one Panasonic(I'm a girl by the way). How can you say that we are here just spending the american people's money? I just can't imagine if all the international students returned back to their countries, how many restaurants and shops would be close, how many person would lost their job? Please be tolerant to international students
