Dear officer,

I believe that 12 months regular plus 24 months extension time is very good for OPT program. I was a Phd student in University of Southern California and worked for a scientific program for two years. Based on my experience, a good scientific program need and have to last at least two years or more. Once we decided to cut the OPT length, I 100% believe most of the scientific program in most top schools will be effect a lot due to the students may lose their VISA during the program which will be a disaster to academic and industry.
