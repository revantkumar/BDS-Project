Janani Sundaresan OPT extension is a boon for foreign students and also equally for the USA economy. The knowledge gained in United States is being utilized in United States and both the students and employers are benefited. When the time period for OPT is increased, more students would put to use the skills obtained for a longer period and gain experience. If the time period is reduced, the number of students coming to United States might reduce since only limited time is there to utilize the skills obtained and gain hands on experience. If this rule is not implemented the US economy would take a huge hit.

Students would be forced to exit country with half baked knowledge and the employers would be forced to recruit another person within a short span of time and again waste time and money in training and recruitment.

To prevent all these hassles the OPT extension should be approved which is beneficial for both the students community and US economy.
