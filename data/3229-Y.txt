I'll keep this brief. Corporations want this new rule because they prefer foreign STEM workers to American STEM worker because foreigners will work more cheaply, and not because there is a shortage of qualified STEM workers. With all the corporations cutting back and people being out of work, how could there possibly be such a shortage?

As I always say, what's good for big business is usually bad for everyone else.
