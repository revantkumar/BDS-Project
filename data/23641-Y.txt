I strongly SUPPORT the proposed OPT STEM rule which extends OPT to 24 months for STEM graduates. Reasons are the following:

1. The rule can make the OPT STEM program more appealing which will attract more international talents to come to the US to pursue their education. This will boost the academic and research quality of US universities.

2. The rule can help US companies to better leverage the advanced knowledge and skills that the STEM graduates have, and achieve greater business successes both domestically and globally.

3. The hiring decisions made by the companies are merit-based, so if some American STEM graduates can't get hired, that means they are not good enough. Therefore, whether there's a lack of capable American STEM graduates is a meaningless question because capable is a relative term. Actually, if an American STEM graduate and an international one are equally technically capable, the American graduate has some advantages because of language and the higher cost of hiring an international one due to the subsequent work visa petitions, etc.
