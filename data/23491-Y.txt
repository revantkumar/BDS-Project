I MUST HAVE TO support the OPT extending proposal for the following reasons:

1. The US government should let student make some contribution to the country since the students studied in US. Thus, the OPT is a must opportunity for them.

2. As far as I know, there's only a little number of local people will take STEM major, while most students major in STEM are international students. If the proposal is declined, less and less students will learn those high-edge knowledge which must undermine US's technology and science filed.

3. The OPT is a excellent opportunity for the country to make profit.
