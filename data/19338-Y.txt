I saw the comments for the last two days. I found the comments seems come from same person. Hope more diversification comments~

I think this policy absolutely benefits for USA. The OPT extension will help many corporations, especially IT corporations, grow rapidly and become stronger. These corporations are the core benefits of USA. Although some positions will be offered for some foreigners, they will take benefits for all Americans. Besides, the one who can get the offer must either have great knowledge or have great skill. As we know USA is an open and tolerant society, she welcomes all the excellent talents that will bring the country fresh blood.So I think the OPT extension is a good policy for the whole country.
