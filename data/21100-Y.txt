This new 24-month OPT extension means a lot for international students in STEM fields. Many of those international students like me spend 5-6 years to obtain PhD degree, and become skilled researchers and/or technicians that apparently benefit to the States. Many of them will hope to stay in the US and look for research positions such as postdoctoral scholar in the relevant fields. These positions always require visa sponsorship that cost additional expense to the employers, which I think is nothing but a waste of time and money. In this sense, the STEM OPT extension plays a key role to benefit both the international students and their employers. If there is indeed any loophole in the regulation of OPT extension, then we should improve it instead of completely abandoning the ruling. I don't see any advantages of vacating the ruling of OPT extension, but just unforeseeable chaos and damage to the IT and research areas of the US, and will certainly deteriorate the US economy in the long run. Therefore, I am in full support to this new OPT STEM regulation.
