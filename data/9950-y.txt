pinky Anonymous I Strongly support the Stem Extension rule. International students are encouraged to study in america is because of the reason of getting a wide and great platform to apply their skills. And the proof of their skills is visible in every single technology available these days. Graduate students working hard to prove them selves and contribute to the best inventions in the company. There is no such a reason that it will steal the jobs of Americans. No one can steal your abilities and your intelligence. If grad student wont get opportunities here then they will apply their skill some where else, so why not in america. The more you give the more you get. 

America is the land of opportunities and let it be the land of opportunities for all of those dream workers who deserves it. I believe instead of giving citizenship to illegal immigrants, improve the rules for students so that who ever thinking of entering in US illegally will at least be inspired to enter in a student visa, study here and pay taxes. 

With the stem extension rule, I also hope the H 1-B quota gets increased for Grad students.
