Wade Kennedy I strongly support this proposal. I am a structural engineer, and I am working with several international people in my company. I have to say that they are smart and hard workers. They always work hard to satisfy the clients and to make their analysis accurate. They can always bring new ideas as well. And it is really interesting to have people from other countries in your office. They teach me their language and bring me food from their country. We always go out together to different places for lunch. I love to work with international people.
