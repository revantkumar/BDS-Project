I Strongly support this ruling. As a STEM professor, I could feel great benefit from International students because of OPT extension.

1. OPT extension attracts students: OPT program is directly related to US educational institutions and is fundamentally a selling point of the US educational market. A lot of people come to the US rather than go to other countries because of this benefit. If the extension was canceled, then it would be a threat to the US educational institutions financially. 

2. OPT extension helps research: US higher education has been long short of enough students to do research. If the attractiveness of US education went down because of the cancellation of the extension, then the US research and high tech would be the first victim. US will lose its biggest advantage over other countries and will eventually lose its power. 

3. OPT extension will not hurt. People cannot equate OPT with the general immigration problem. OPT is very restrictive - only granted to those who have studied in a US institution. It is not even immigration.
