Delta Chan I really appreciate the work to improve OPT extension. US economy and innovation have been halted for years. We really need new scientists, engineers and workers with high technology to improve the situation. Introducing new F1 students with high tech degree is one of the right thing to do, while the other thing is to improve H1B and PERM application to make sure qualified engineers can stay in US.

Compared to millions of illegal immigration, the small amount of F1 students will not do harm to US domestic job market. US should keep to maintain a competitive nation, by encouraging diligent and hardworking people, rather than protecting lazy people by protectionism. Those who claim F1 students damage US domestic job are basically those who lay on their bed and wait for free food. US domestic people should study and work, not dreaming about US government protects them by expelling smart and hardworking people.

All in all, I completely agree with the law to improve F1 OPT extension.
