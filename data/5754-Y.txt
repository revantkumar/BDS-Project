B Talbot Stop giving our jobs to foreigners. Train and employ our citizens first. If there are left overs then offer them to outsiders. Big business is a major contributor to our economic problems in this country. You are selling out our country and it is not only disgusting but criminal and unpatriotic. You only care about money. How will you make money once you destroy America and the middle class? who will buy your products? You destroy our means of employment and there will be no money for our citizens to buy things. Then tell me how long your foreign workers will remain loyal to your company? Get with the program and look beyond the $$$$$$$ you are saving and pocketing by using foreign workers. How long will you bubble last?
