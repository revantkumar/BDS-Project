These international students shouldn't be blamed for unemployment, since they work in industries which have a shortage of highly-competent workers. They have to go through interviews just like American students do. If they are not good enough, companies will not hire them. The hiring process is based on qualification, who can do a better job. If you can do a good job, you will get hired no matter where you are from, or what you look like. Unemployment is most likely caused by the many millions of illegal immigrants that take any kind of job everywhere.
