Adam Lee I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. longer OPT period would attract more international students to American universities benefiting economy with the consumption they bring;

2. According to my experience, international students are highly motivated and well educated. A lot of them come to U.S. for their master's of PHD degrees. We should try our best to convince such kind of people stay here instead of working somewhere else because of visa restriction;

3. America is a immigration country, shutting door to newcomers is just doing things in the opposite way.
