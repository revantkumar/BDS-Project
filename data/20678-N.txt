Once again the American desiring employment is pushed aside for the more desirable foreigner who will work for less money. Let's hire cheaper labor and keep Americans unemployed. The bottom line must always rule!! Let American families go hungry or lose their car or house due to high numbers of unemployed wage earners. Numbers like 94 million and rising. Who cares about our families? The almighty bottom line is looking a little better if we can get some foreigner to live in cheap quarters that I myself wouldn't put up with. And my American employee can train the foreigner before I fire him or her. I'm so proud of myself. Maybe I'll get a bonus for being so efficient and increasing the bottom line. It's all about me, isn't it?
