For the record, stop giving incentives to employers for the sake of political correctness..our undergraduates ( Americans who live here) need these jobs for stepping stones, not a foreign student on loan from his country.. Let them sling hamburgers for Macdonalds while they are here. We want and need tech jobs for our own US born citizens..
