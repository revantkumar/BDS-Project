This is absolutely a good opportunity for International Students. Because the majority of international students have been performing well in their universities both on academic and social events, they should also be given chances to perform their professional skills here in the United States. Also, because of their diversity, the companies which hired international students will also benefit from this act because of their broad visions and knowledge of different countries.
