I oppose the DHs new rule over Stem students as it woud be really unfair for those who are non stem students. NonStem students should also get the equal opportunities as they also equally work hard to make it till there. In this judgement employers will get even more chance to exploit STEM students as they will get 3 years of OPT and they will be also a cheap labour for them. therefore all should given an eual opportunity and even Non STEM students should be encouraged with equal opt allowance otherwise there would be no more managers left in any organization.
