This proposal will surely help accelerating our economy, so I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. It will enable students with STEM degrees to have longer time to work in US and greater possibility to get an H1B visa, which will in return, contribute to the leadership of US in economy and technology. It's a win-win deal.
