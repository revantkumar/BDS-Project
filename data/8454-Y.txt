I really think the OPT extension will be beneficial for both US and foreign students. First, with the OPT extension, the US university tends to be more attractive than European Universities, since working experience is quite important in education process. With more and more international students choosing US university, this definitely promotes US economy greatly. Imagine the need for the cars, the need for the house. these all will do lots of contribution to the economy, which will create more jobs for US workers on other fields since OPT extension is only for STEM majors. Secondly, there are all kinds of regulations on the qualifications about OPT extension, like the companies should be e-verified, which makes sure that the company can't hire foreign workers for cheap compensation instead of US workers. All these regulations about OPT extension are trying to create a fair job markets, both for the US workers and foreign workers.
