Markos Fikaris I will go even further and extend the stay to 5 years after graduation and it can not be optional. The only option that should be given is to become a U.S. citizen by going through the FULL procedure and taking the citizenship test IN ENGLISH ONLY. If they have a job, of any kind, TAXES SHOULD BE PAID . Access to government programs, including food stamps should be granted, ONLY to students who are LEGAL AMERICAN CITIZENS. If after 5 years they do not became citizens, they go back to their own country.
