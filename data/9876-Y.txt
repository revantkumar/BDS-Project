I fully support DHS' view and initiative on amending F-1 OPT Extension. It is a long waited policy change that would attract more and higher quality students to the U.S. and eventually boost production of the society.

In my experience, 12-month OPT is like a half hoot. Many students graduates and start OPT, but almost immediately many of them they need to start applying for H-1B since this is also a annual process. Who would support them before they actually achieved something in work? In my work life, most projects lasts longer than a year. A few months is not even enough for creating a plan.

With the previous 17-month extension, STEM students have the chance to actually dig into their work and then decide whether to stay in U.S., at the same time their employer would have enough to tell if supporting H-1B for them is a good call or not. But still, this is a one shot chance. There's barely enough time for STEM students to try error. They don't have time to change employer, change direction, or generally make any adjustment.

This new OPT Extension policy solves all these problems and make it a really opportunity for F-1 STEM students. During their OPT period, they would have real life work experience, and contribute to U.S. market too. Needless to say they are usually higher skilled. This new policy is a win-win solution for U.S. and for those students.
