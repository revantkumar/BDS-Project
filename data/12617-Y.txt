America is always an immigration if you look back to the history. Everyone who can contribute to Anerican society and economical situation should be given the right to stay in this common land. Chinese people work hard besides they are intelligent therefore we have no reason rejecting them to help make America better. Also for people who believe this immigration policy will harm American getting jobs, the problem doesn't come from policy because nobody will lose s job forever unless he/she becomes lazy.
