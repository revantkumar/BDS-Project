I absolutely support the OPT expanding, which definitely benefit the American government and all american people. All the F1 student are studying and working very hard more than 20 years and what they only want to apply their knowledge into real applications, which of course in return brings great influence to United State. 

As we all know, united state is composed with all immigrants. because of our coverage and Harding working, United state became the best country in the world. however, few people are getting lazy and do not want study and improve themselves. they only want ask help and money from the government and tax-payers and they also extremely wrongly ask the government preventing all incoming new F1 opportunities. 

Numerous international students do lots of contribution to this country and they also pay tax to perform their responsibility. to view a big picture, we have to provide more opportunities to these smart, working-hard F-1 student, and let them compete with each other. Then we picked the best of them to work for our country, so United state could be the best advanced country forever, and our children will also have a good life because of our decision.
