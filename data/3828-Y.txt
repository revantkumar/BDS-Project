I think it is a brilliant idea to extent OPT for 24 months and here are the seasons:

1: With this extension, it gives America more time to benefit from those talent students and explore their potential; As we all know that people with expertise is the one who lead the development of a country in 21th century. With this extension, America pay lowest price to keep a huge population of talent people 

2:Thinking about it again: a student receives his or her professional training offered in US, once he or she come back to their countries immediately after graduate, America does not benefit anything from that. 

3: Those student contribute not just to their professions area, but also culture and economic. For every student who study or work in US, we rent, we pay tax, we eat, we buy. All of those stimulate the economic in America. 

Thus, I support this OPT extension
