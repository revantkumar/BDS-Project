Erika Dsouza I support the 24 month program since it will allow many students who have already invested thousands of dollars in the US economy. It will allow them to gain experience to help the world and their own countries along with USA. The proposed formal mentoring and training program would benefit the students greatly and allow them to attain work experience in a well designed manner. The new rule will also prevent misuse of international students. Companies are really competitive in their recruiting process and allowing international students to gain an experience in these companies would also the company to have diverse culture. The 24 months would allow the students to gain enough experience before setting out to help their own countries.

For all these reasons I support the STEM opt extension for 24 months.
