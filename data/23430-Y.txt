I suspect there are some people hired by some organizations in order to oppose this regulation. They don't quite understand what is this rule and how important this is to the American future.
One reason they claimed is that STEM students are cheap foreign labors. Actually STEM students are not cheap, they are even more expensive than U.S. citizens. I am working in a big IT company in Seattle. As far as I know, companies in IT industry spend a lot of money hiring people. If there is a U.S. citizen whose skill is above our hiring bar, we will definitely hire him/her before we hiring foreigners. However, we cannot lower the hiring bar simply because the competition is furious globally and we only want to be the number one. We need the best people and that is the only way to keep innovation, and keep the prosperity of U.S. IT industry. 
When we hire those STEM students, their salaries are the same with U.S. citizens (we are not discriminating anyone). We end up paying more money because we spend money for their OPT extension, working visa, or green card application. So don't draw conclusion that STEM students are cheap labors, probably they are one of the group which have the highest salary in U.S.
They deserve their salaries because they are the best skilled workers. Think about PhDs behind those predictive systems in Google, Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, etc. Think about those researchers working on nuclear or areaspace industry. The contribution they make is far more than the money we think we spend. Period.
