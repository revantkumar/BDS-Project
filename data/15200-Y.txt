I strongly support the OPT extension rule. 
As far as we concerned, the United States is a melting pot with its great capacity of immigrants. With the OPT rule, students from foreign countries have the opportunity to gain more experience out of campus. Thats exactly the reason why a lot of my friends and me chose America for study. In the university I attended, there were less than 5 international students in the year of 2011 in our department, but in 2014, the amount of international students became 40 in our department. I believe this great change is driven by the great interest. Also, at the town my school located, one of my local friends is a bus driver. He told me the transit company hired more staff in terms of the increasing students. There is no doubt that the local economy has been stimulated by the increasing demand.
From my personal experience, I think the OPT extension rule needs to cover more majors instead of only STEM majors. As an international student majoring in accounting, it took me much longer to find a job after I graduated because hiring a foreigner is costly and complicated for a lot companies. The Americans have way too many opportunities to find a good job. So I cannot agree with the idea that we are jeopardizing the Americans in the job market. When I finally got a job and worked for only nine months, it came to the H1-B via application. The little chance of winning this lottery made me had to stop working. My boss was really disappointed and he had to spend more money and time to find another person to fill out the position. 
In addition, most Americans are born in a family which immigrated to America and settled down in this country. Why the United States cannot be as open and generous as it used to be?
