OPT extension is beneficial for both foreign students and the economy, and by extension, American workers. 
If we do not keep those talented future scientists and engineers in the US and work among us, they will return to their home country work against us. What do you think will happen if we lose all foreign-born scientists and engineers in our country to rival countries? Do you think US can keep up with them? Do you want the US to continue being the world's best country or not?
By denying OPT extension, we are providing fewer chance for those future scientists and engineers to stay here. With current H1B lottery system, that means we get more non-STEM low skill foreign workers. If you think the US is not an immigration country and do not need immigrants, you'd better move out and leave your land to its original owner, the American indians. With fixed number of new immigrants every year, do you prefer them to be highly educated scientists and engineers, or some low skilled worker? Those high skilled workers can make America a better place, and low skilled worker more likely would take your jobs away.
