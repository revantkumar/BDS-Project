Sai prasad reddy Pininti I extremely support opt extension. Because there is nothing wrong in providing a platform for intelligent and brilliant people all around the world. In that way only we can expect the change in generation by generation in different field's and sector's. I think with the collaboration of billions of intelligent minds only we are here today. For example we can see Microsoft and Google running successfully from lots of years because of not a single person but because of each and every person from different parts of this world who are working in support of them by utilizing the platform provided by them. So I support opt stem extension.
