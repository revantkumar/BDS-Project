I am a international student, I welcome this rule to be implemented soon. United States of America is one of the strongest and powerful country in the world. That's the reason entire world is looking for opportunities in America. There are so many countries who don't have the good education system, I mean there is no quality in education. United States of America gives this opportunities for foreign students to purse their higher education. This Opt program will allow those highly skilled professional students to put their skills into real time experience. In way they are contributing to growth of United States economy. This extra 24 months extension time will give ample time to gain enough experience so that when they go back to their home countries they will have good feature. Since US don't want to increase their H1B quota, this is good move from DHS. 
Education is only way people and notation's will developed. We can't mix this education system with politics. If America supports foreign students, we will support US economy. I strongly recommend DHS to implement this rule. God bless you and god bless United States of America.
