I strongly support this proposal. The proposal is only to extend the time that international students are allowed to work in US and will not impact the fact that any company will like to hire domestic student having the same or even lower qualifications because of numerous other existed laws. The value that those international students created are much more than they earned and are in fact creating more job opportunities for citizens instead of decreasing them. The succesion of US economy today is based on open market, including capital AND HUMAN RESOURCES instead of unreasonable restrictions
