Olivia Sanderson This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. These benefits will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed. This rule will strengthen the relationships between America and other countries. That is, they can share more information, more resources and more opportunities.
