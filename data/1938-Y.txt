Landon John As a IT stuff in Valley. I think if the proposal dies, that will cause over 50% decrease for Valley.

I don't think the proposal for native American is unfair. Our companies need talented people from different countries. If you are capable enough, you will find a job.

What's more, diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. Government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. It will also force native American student to study hard to be more competitive.
