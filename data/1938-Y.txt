I highly supported this new proposed OPT program which will further enhance the U.S competitiveness and economy by maintaining the well-educated workforce in this county. I am an international student from China and have just got my PhD degree in Electrical Engineering in 2015 July. I got hired by an electric power industry company right after my graduation. I was so shocked and frustrated when I heard about the news that OPT extension program was ruled invalid and working STEM students may be forced out of this country. 
As the most successful immigrant country, the skilled immigrant workers played a critical role in driving the rise of America. In order to compete in the future, maintaining the STEM workforce and encouraging the international students contribute to the technology and science research and development would definitely enhance the global competitiveness of this country. 
If you take a glance at the workforce composition of the high technology company in silicon valley such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Tesla, the national research laboratories, the R&D department of the manufacturing companies, it would destroy the whole industry if the STEM workforce have to leave the country due to the working authorization. Only by creating an continuous and well-educated workforce that U.S can keep to compete with developed European countries and the fast-growing countries like China, South Korea.
