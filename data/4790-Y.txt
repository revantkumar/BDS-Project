I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should give students who studied in U.S. universities have time to stay in the country and contribute to U.S..
2. Competition does existbut the competition is not bad. It can help U.S. get the most excellent people from all around the world.
University is important for the U.S. because many celebrities studied at U.S. as an internationl student before they become famous.
