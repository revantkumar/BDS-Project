Expansion of this program is reckless and damaging to Americans who work in or are studying in STEM related areas. Despite rules that are supposed to prevent it, too many American companies hire foreign workers to replace Americans because they DO work for less money and they essentially become indentured servants. What incentive do American high school graduates have to declare STEM majors in college when they already know the fields are inundated with foreigners who are priority hires? Even if they do find jobs, their salaries are stifled and stagnant because the supply of foreigners available to fill the positions is never-ending, despite what the kid CEOs of our nation want you to believe. Their bottom line is cheaper labor for higher profits-- not hiring Americans. The media states that American kids aren't so interested in STEM careers. Who in their right mind would be when they see student debt for STEM degrees from $50,000 - $75,000, few job opportunities, or low entry level salaries with no growth potential? If your plan is to destroy the American middle class and squelch growth and development opportunities for young Americans you're doing a great job.
