If The country has to improve, then people who have good education need to be given a chance. Please make it simple for employers to hire F1 students instead of putting all blockades by administrative rules . SIMPLIFY the rules so that it is easy for people to follow. If you do not want F1 students to come & study here, then do not give admission to students in the universities. However, you want them to come here study but afterwards will not let them make their living here is not fair. 

Country needs bright honest & educated people.
