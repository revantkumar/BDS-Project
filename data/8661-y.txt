jay braun Look we have enough immigrants both legal and illegal in the country. Letting more in and more stay will just mean companies will hire them at a cheaper wage. The crap hole some nations are will mean that a guy from that country will be happy as a democrat with a tax dollar to make 25k for a job that an American normally gets 50k for. We need to put americans first. REpublicans need to quit worrying about the cheaper labor and democrats need to quit worrying about the votes.
