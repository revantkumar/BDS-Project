The OPT extension is beneficial for both students and the United States. A lot of talented foreign students will be able to sharpen their techniques and gain more knowledge and experience, which makes them valuable asset to the company and stimulate the economy of the States. Moreover, the better and more qualified professionals, such as engineer, physicists, with the extended training time from the OPT extension will most likely create more products whether those are physical or intellectual leading to more profit for the company and stimulate the economy of the country. 

In conclusion, the bill should be passed for the "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students"

Thanks a lot!
