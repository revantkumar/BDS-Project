I strongly support this new ruling.
First of all, OPT extension has nothing to do with unemployment rate of US citizens. It is intended to solve the shortage of high tech talents. As we can see from people around us, no US citizen students lose their job due to international students. Most of them are able to get rewarding jobs.

Second, clever as US citizen should understand that high tech companies are the major driver for economic growth of US, the new ruling will help retain those smart brains inside US, which from the other perspective increase the competency of US and keep the potentiality for future economic growth. Only the economic condition of US becomes better, will the unemployment rate decrease and we can together build a better US for our future generations.
