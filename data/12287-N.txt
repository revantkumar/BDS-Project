I'm 61 years old and I lost my job because I got sick. It's been 2 years and Half that I have been looking for a job and cannot find one. I can't believed that you are doing this to the American people. I have people leaving were I leave that are working under the table and they are not American. Why are you doing this too us. So you are like telling us people out of state can work in the USA and screw the American people. There is something wrong with this picture.
