I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions in the U.S..

2. Many great scientists and engineers who made countless of contributions to the U.S. were international students who received their higher education in the U.S..

3. As the economical environment of the U.S. being better, companies in the U.S. have a much more positive attitude to employ international employees. And even though, there are still a great number of positions which is related to science and technology are empty and need scientists and engineers, especially in the field of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
