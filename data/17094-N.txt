This is just SO wrong and all levels. I can't understand why anyone would agree to this. This cuts American workers out in favor of immigrants????? Why is this even being considered ????? Something is very wrong at the top of this nation for something like this to even be considered. Why not just allow the most qualified applicant to get the job without allowing special "favors " for a small group of people?? I am saddened to see such a idea even proposed. This is what is destroying this nation.
