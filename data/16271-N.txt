It is without logic to allow additional persons to enter the US as workers in the face of releasing former prison inmates who will need jobs to prevent re-incarceration as well as the demand for employment for US citizens who are completing school to prepare them for some of those same available positions. If you truly represent the people who elected you to public office, pay your salary and perks, as well as provide for your retirement, the least that could be expected is for you to protect the job opportunities available in the US for these individuals and their offspring who supported your election.
