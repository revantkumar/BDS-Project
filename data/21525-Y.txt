I have worked with many skilled immigration workers, most of them have Master or Doctoral degrees, they are US educated, I have to admit that to some extent their STEM skill is better than those of US students on average. Their diverse backgrounds are bring in more innovation, more fresh ideas. I like them. 
Foreign workers do fill a critical needparticularly in the STEM fields. Now more than ever, we need an honest conversation about reforms that can improve and strengthen the admission of these immigrants into our labor force. 
I strongly support the newly proposed STEM extension, and I hope the administration can do more to keep the talents here in the USA.
