As a nurse educator and clinician working in elder care, I see the tremendous needs for development of capacity training and workforce for elder care. There is a shortage of all levels of professionals and workers. I work with over dozens of elder care providers, some have business in China, they ask me to provide interns or talents for them. I am currently working with a group of University MBA students in healthcare management to meet that needs. Having longer OPT will certainly help US business especially in elder care . Thank you for your consideration. Lily Chen, RN, MA
