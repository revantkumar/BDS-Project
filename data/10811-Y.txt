I fully support the new STEM rule. Attracting the world's most talented to US universities and allowing students to stay for some time to work is essential to bring economic and cultural benefits to the US.

Most common dissenting opinion is that this new rule would take away more jobs and opportunities away from American cities. However, this is a not only shorted-sighted but also incorrect statement.

According to studies [1], a quarter of U.S. tech companies was either founded or leaded by foreign-born executives. In 2005, these companies generated $52 billion in revenue and employed 450,000 workers. The new STEM rule will undoubtedly benefit more international students and therefore contribute to much more jobs in U.S. In addition, it is paramount to remain increasing competitiveness of U.S. businesses in the global economy.
