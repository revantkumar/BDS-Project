Sabine Francis I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months.
- International students pursue their education in the US as it offers plenty of opportunities that their home countries don't. 
- The US provides all its students, whether international or Americans, with an excellent education and resources to prosper. Why would it not encourage international students to stay then?
- Extending the F1 OPT allows the development of the economic/technical sectors in the US. As companies grow, they will want to hire more people too!
