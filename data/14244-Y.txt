I strongly support the proposal as an international student , who further my master study here in the U.S and current work as a full time engineer in P.A. Indeed, this proposal could extend my opportunity to work here ,but working here is totally different from living. The reason why more and more international professionals come to the U.S and would like to use up their talents here is because America is one of the most diversity country in the world. Equal , Freedom and Respect, all of these term combined with the American dream courage the young generation to fight for their dream. I appreciate the opportunity and experience for all the past four years , and would like to make my own contribution to the industry I like. If I have an additional 24 months here after I graduate, I can definitely add the value to the American Industry. I will feel no regret when I went back to China at the end because I fight for my dream once. I believe this is a common feeling from most students who studied here with a passion ,or a dream. As to the whole life, 24 month is not a long time ,but to most students aged in 20 to 30, this is a period they learn how to grow up. Please give us a chance to make our own decision on the beginning of our career. 

Thanks
