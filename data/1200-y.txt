Ru Jia I am a STEM student in the U.S., I have really very much sincerely wish to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. I hope American government could give us much more chances to work or intern after our hard working. It is not aim to immigrant but it is the greatest experience and best chance for us to practice after graduating. Extending of time will give us much more time to prepare and find a suitable job, and gain more experiences ever.
