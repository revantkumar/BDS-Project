In my own prospective as a master student in mathematics, I strongly agree with the STEM OPT expansion proposal. Because it will bring the whole society into a virtuous circle.

The new proposal will definitely benefit the recovering US economy by enable more than 50000 foreign students to continue their work. As we all know, for High tech companies and Startups, even for many Fortune 500 companies, foreign students are one of the most important resource for labor. Using their proficient skills in science and engineering, foreign students are not only realizing their self- actualization in US, but also helping the US economy grow in a long term.
I have many foreign friends who play important roles in different industry in US right now, they are smart, hardworking and willing to make contribution for the society. They are irreplaceable parts in the US economy and are role models for the future students.

For current STEM students and prospective students who plan to apply for STEM degrees, the new proposal will make the US a good choose to working and study. Thats a great news for Universities and research institutions since they will become more attractive to the talent worldwide. With the help of foreign students, they can do their research and develop new technologies in a better way and benefit the whole world.
