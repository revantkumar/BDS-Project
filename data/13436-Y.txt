I strongly support this proposed rule. Many foreign students paid high tuition fee for getting STEM degrees in the US. If they cannot have the OPT extension opportunity and have to go back to home country because of no valid work visa, I think this will cause more prospective students to evaluate if it is worthwhile to pursue their master or doctor's degree in the US. The education industry may suffer from it.
