People who think the OPT extension will benefit foreign nationals at the expense of American workers, please THINK AGAIN. Lets simply picture these two factious candidates, both of whom are no less qualified for the posted job opening than each other. With all other conditions being equal, one is a U.S. citizen and the other is of foreign nationality. Who do you think the company would hire? Hands down the U.S. citizen! The fact is, considering the visa sponsorship and the H1B cap-subject lottery, it is way more costly for a company to hire a foreign national than an American worker. Simply put, no employer will choose to hire foreigners if they can find enough domestic talents. 

And for those who made the comment of securing American jobs by discontinuing the OPT extension, Ive also got news. I go to college in the middle west and during the past summer I interned with a local company. It is a large Fortune 500 enterprise and one of the major employers around the area. Due to its expansion of business, the companywide demand for talents continues to grow, particularly for IT specialists. Over these years, the company have had to let go of some excellent experienced foreign workers because they didnt survive the annual H1B selection and in some cases, the business operation was completely disrupted because of this, incurring huge losses on the company And guess what? They decided to hire and sponsor more foreign nationals because theoretically only one third of them are expected to obtain a work visa. By offering an extension, companies will feel more secure to hire less people to fill in the gap between the growing demand and short supply of STEM graduates, because they can work legally for up to 3 years even without a work visa. 

Therefore, I am in favor of this rule because, well like I said, it contributes to Americas economy in very real ways!
