YU ZENG I strongly support this rule. It will definitely benefit all the nation from several reasons. As an undergraduate student in Oklahoma State, I have a lot to say.

1. As you may notice, there is a relatively small amount american students in STEM PhD level. The advanced research and high technology are mostly conducted and found by international students. If you are willing to develop faster and higher in STEM area which can benefit all the people in the country, international students are meant to be hired. The company, the state and the nation will lose high-tech brilliant international students if the rule is canceled. 

2. International students pay MORE tuition fee than american students. For those who said We were using their tax to pay for our tuition, did you know how much we need to pay for our education compared to American students? What's more, we pay tax which goes to the country when we get a part-time job in university/college. 

3. Everyone should have equal rights in the nation. We are holding legal non-immigrate F1 student visa and we should have same equal right to legally find a company and get an legal internship as others. 

4. Don't blame international students if some Americans cannot find a job or have been fired. Are they major in STEM? Did they work really hard? Did they get a college degree or master degree? 

I support this rule and I'm looking forward to seeing a better nation ahead. United States should do something good for the whole nation.
