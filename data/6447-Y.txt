I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1) Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tremendously in US economy growth. If US could not keep these people work for US companies, probably US could lose its top position in IT technology. This proposal , if passed, would enable elite tech students to contribute to the US economy after their graduation. Without an OPT extension, they are more likely to work for companies in their home country, while it would be good for their own countries' development, it is bad for US's economy.

2) STEM will not affect non-STEM's people's job. An bank will not hire a computer science student for an Accounting position and vice-versa.

3) While competing do exist, it is not a bad thing. Without this OPT-extension, US native tech workers may be easier to find an IT job, however, IT companies would less likely to hire excellent engineers for their positions because they are now working for other countries, which would lower the competitiveness of these US based IT companies in the world. Competition enable people to hone their skills and better prepare for the job. Eliminate competition is a bad idea.
