The proposed rule regarding STEM degree of OPT extension for 24months will undoubtedly help stimulate the USA economics. 

An F-1 graduate who contribute their youth (maybe not so young because some of them are PhD), knowledge and passion for helping this great country to grow and develop SHOULD have an equal opportunity to get employment to exploit their talent, as mentioned in the majority of USA companies career openings (no discrimination for nationality, race, gender, etc.) 

I can the most highly support this policy to pass.
