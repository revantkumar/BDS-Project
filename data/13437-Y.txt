I do believe the proposed rule is good for everyone, really everyone, US citizen, US industry, federal government and maybe foreign students. Basically, the ones who are against the proposed rule are worrying about the competition for jobs or salaries. But actually, it is the other way round. Foreign students contribute their best knowledge in the best time of their lives to US industries, which dramatically foster the US economy grow, thus lead to more job opportunities. I interned at Silicon Valley last year, and heard a lot of complains that the US current (non)immigrant rules limit many talented entrepreneurs, e.g. startup founders, who eventually go back their own country and make very successful companies, startups. That is saying, US are losing talent people. The proposed rule can slightly compensate such a loss. More open (non)immigrant rules seem urgent.

Some ridiculous comments I have seen, basically say, US is their own country and aliens should be kicked out ASAP. However, it is mostly likely that their own ancestors are actually aliens.
