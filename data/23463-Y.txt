The proposed rule for OPT STEM not only helps the students to work for that period of time but also brings the innovation from around the world . As this is related to the students who travelled from different places to study here and worked really hard in completing their graduation ,it is important that they should be provided a certain amount of time to work here and pay back to the society .

I strongly support this new rule which gives 24 months of time in OPT STEM Exension to all the eligible students.
