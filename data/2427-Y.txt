I STRONGLY support the OPT extension proposal. 
My dad is from China and got his master's degree as an electrical engineer about six years ago. He has been working hard since he graduated and has contributed a LOT to his boss and company. His engineering skills are so strong that he became a specialist in his company and has been regarded as "indispensable".
I do not want to mention more about my dad. The only thing I want to mention is that my dad used his OPT period to strength himself and get a good job. The OPT really helped him a lot to make him a qualified engineer and his performance is the best proof to support the significance of OPT. If the OPT time is expanded, I believe more skilled engineers and scientists will be able to prove their competitiveness and become the engine of US economy. 
For those who do not support OPT: if you cannot find jobs, it is not because of international students. Improve yourself and your own skills instead of ruin other peoples' dreams and future!
