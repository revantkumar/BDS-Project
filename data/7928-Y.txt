Shi Pu OPT Extensions for STEM students are very beneficial to the economics of United States because these are the people who are truly intelligent, innovative, diligent in creating things that bring value to the United States, and even human world. 

They come to our country for with their American dreams, hoping they can be the ones stand at the peak of the world where all the people with great mindset and drive to change the world. True, these could be students from developing countries or underdeveloped countries, our country really gives them the opportunity to grow and prosper. Otherwise, they may have to become workers in factories doing tedious job and wasting their talent. I am not denying that giving them 24 more months of working authorization in this country can not guarantee them a great live, but 3 years fresh from school are important timeframes for them to absorb and change the environment. 

This is a win-win situation for both sides. We should definitely be supportive for them and give them more opportunities to explore.
