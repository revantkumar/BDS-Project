I strongly support this new rule. This new rule will definitely promote U.S. economy. More jobs will be produced when economy is better. I don't see foreign students as main competitors to domestic workers, not in most companies in Silicon Valley. 
On the other hand, here in the valley, start-ups really like using STEM students especially Maters PhDs who can provide fresh academic ideas. One start-up I know, around 30 people now, has hired STEM foreign students to develop their core recommendation algorithm. 
Imagine if this proposed rule fails, and those students need to go home with core algorithms the tech start-up relies on halted suddenly. The start-up has little hope in getting more funds and have to lay off all other 20 domestic workers before shut-down. 
My point is, people who are now against this, are trying to make a chaos, sending OPT students back home and making tech company to look for replacement in a hurry, and believe they can survive and thrive.
But, when economy is bad and tech company loses money, how do you know you won't go down with the ship???
