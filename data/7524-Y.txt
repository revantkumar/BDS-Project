Ritsy Yang I must support this proposal for following reasons
First, America is always composed of immigrants, and immigrants have permeated into every corner of American culture. It's safe to say that if there were not so many outstanding foreign students, who received American education, to stay in US, and make contributions, America couldn't have been so developed.
Second, it is near-sighted to say foreign students occupy jobs that are originally for the local. You can't make progress by forcing others to stop. And to be frank, if America doesn't have the capability to attract these elites to stay in US, it is no doubt they will return to their own country and stand in opposite to US, which is even worse in the long run.
