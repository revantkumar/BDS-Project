Every people have rights to fight for their opportunity. We foreigners have been struggling for years. We pay lot more amount in the university than does American citizen but have never complained about it. We also pay taxes, follow all the rules and regulation. For certain months we are getting opportunity to fulfill our desire, interest and talent and expand ourselves in this new world. I deeply request American government to continue this stem program which helps bright and talented people to rise up.
