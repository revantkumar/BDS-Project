I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
International students should have the chance to make the contributions to the US. Lots of occupations, like IT, Science rely importantly on international students. Those students do contribute lots to the economics in the country. The new proposal will definitely help US to maintain its world leadership. 
Also, competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing. The reason why some positions choose international students instead of American students is because the company cannot find suitable Americans. Competition can help US finds the most suitable staff which will increase its competition in the world.
