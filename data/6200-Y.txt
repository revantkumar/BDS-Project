Joanne Mullins This proposal to expand a program that gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign citizens here on student visas over Americans is very disturbing to American workers! Are you really trying to replace native-born Americans with foreign aliens?? This is NOT what America stands for and what American voters want. There are not enough jobs for the unemployed Americans already here. What makes you think there will be jobs for these F-1 students? We must provide for our own and employ Americans first, period.
