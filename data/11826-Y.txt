As an entrepreneur, I truly understand the value of these STEM workers to our economy and hence encourage DHS to get this proposal through in a timely manner. 
Ours is innovation driven economy, it is childish to state that a tech firm will hire a foreign national over a US citizen when it involves a lot more paper work and not to mention, no long term commitment.
