I support this term as the STEM is the basic and important key in the development of US. In order to develop US in a rapid and highly richer way, the engineering and techniques are the best way. 

The reason why US still leads the world is that STEM is still much more advanced than any country in the world. So more and more excellent STEM workers are needed. Also, for the international STEM employees, higher tax ratio almost 40% of their income has submitted to the citizens of US, which is also an important income for the US government. 

So the expanding of the STEM OPT period should be approved and supported.
