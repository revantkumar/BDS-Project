To who concerned, 

Hi, I had to admit that I feel really happy when I heard the news that the opt will extend to 24 months. 
I currently work in a pharmaceutical industry. Here we need a lot of people who are expert in chemistry, statistics and programming. Believe or not, 90 percent of these positions are filled by foreigners like Indians and Chinese. They are really good at what they are doing. And of course , as the company developing, we need more people who are professional. Those people may just graduate from school and really need visa to keep their status to make contributions to their company. 24 months extension gives them more Chances to stay in United States. And help their company grow up. 
Not only in pharmaceutical industry, but also in other technology companies,, they have a lot of foreigners employee who are just graduated. If tthese employees are kicked out because of the short term opt, the company willl have a disaster. The economy will be affected so badly .. 
I saw a lot of international students in school, they are so smart and diligent.. Most of them are top student in class. Those smart students can make huge changes in the future. The are the hope of United States. They are the hope of the world! How lucky we are if we can keep all of them in United States. The longer they stay here , the biggest changes we will have. 
Some people said that they may steal some opportunities of the native people. I highly doubted it. America is a variety country,. The reason that America is one of the strongest country in this world is because it has so many genius and absorbs different culture. It offers so many recourses and opportunities to people all over the world . Won't it be win win if these people make contribution to this country? 
Remember, students from STEM will make differences wherever they are, why not here?
So I think 24 months extension will make this society more successful .
