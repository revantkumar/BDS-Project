I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. International students learned the advanced technology in US Universities, why should they go back to their own country and contribute to their own country. They should just stay here and work for US companies. 

2. Most of international students who come to use, especially the ones with higher education degrees(PhD) are the most talented students in their country or even in the world. Why should we let these people go?? We should give them more freedom to invent more advanced technology.
