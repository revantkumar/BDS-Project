I do support the proposal.

Though it seems more international students would make the market competition in USA more intensely temporarily, we should realize such a fact: The reason for USA is USA is that she accepts people from all over the world, then knowledge and cultures of Human are united by USA. The fact that USA is so strong and powerful today comes from it can contain different people, different cultures, different thought and different talents. Back to the problem mentioned before, more international students entering USA market will increase the competition, however, the Survivor in competition will always be stronger and stronger, then the country would become stronger and stronger, that's one of the most important target for a country, that is also the way that many powerful nation experienced, including America itself. 

I also think USA is not only USA, this word also means confident, advanced, powerful, happy, etc. And the reason leads to it, is CONTAINING!
