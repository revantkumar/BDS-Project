Deep Amrutiya I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I would love contributing to Innovation and American Economy. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule. As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.

If this somehow scares the domestic workers, then international workers can not be blamed for that. Even if the extension is to be removed, it cannot be done in such a hurry. What about thousands of students who are already in the US and hoped to find a job. They were not ready for such a ruling, and this Is unfair to them since they made a life choice by coming to the US.
