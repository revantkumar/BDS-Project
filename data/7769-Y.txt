I HIGHLY SUPPORT the new rule of 24-months OPT extension! America is not only for Americans! It is a land that appreciates diversity, collaboration, equality and dream! 

For a better future of the US and the entire world, we need to hold our hands together. None greatness is accomplished without collaboration, especially in this modern world and in technology field, this is the one and only way to make breakthrough! As a Chinese student, I learnt from my country's own history that being closed and self-centered will only lead to tragedies. America doesn't need to learn it the hard way by going through it again.

We need this equal opportunity to fulfill our goals and dreams!
