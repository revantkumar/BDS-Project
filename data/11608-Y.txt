I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am a Chinese international student and I am currently studying computer science at CMU. During my application, I got offers from universities in HK, Europe. But I choose to come to US because I can easily find the job and get H1B with OPT. So I think OPT will attract more excellent international students to study at US. 

Also, our international students make lots of contributions to the communities and companies of US. For example, people in the US are easy to rent their apartment to our students and then they can improve their income. More restaurants and stores are needed because of our international students. In addition, in IT field, many employee use OPT to work for the companies. Imagine that what will happen if the OPT extension is cancelled. Lots of people will lose their jobs and many IT companies won't release new service and products quickly. And that will badly hurt the US economy.
