Dear HSD,

Thank you very much for all the efforts put to fix the American broken immigration system.

I believe this new regulation is pretty much reasonable which should have been published long time ago. 

As mentioned by the White House "We The People" team, "skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans." For hundreds of years, highly skilled scientists and engineers from all of the world would like to come to the US contributing their knowledge, talents and passions, because of the America's world's best environment for innovation, the developed democracy system, and the friendly and open minded citizens. Some of them stayed in the University doing the scientific researches and some of them went to the industry to push the boundary of the engineering development. Tremendous benefits to the United States have been made and are making by these foreign scientists, engineers and students. This is also why the America can hold the leader position of the world. Without them, our world's best companies will lose the competition with other countries', and without the stimulus policies, the talented researchers and students will go to other countries which are welcome them. In stead of setting more and more barriers to lose these precious resources, we should publish more new regulations like expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degrees. 

I'm looking forward to seeing these new break-through regulations bring more and more great scientists and engineers to this country contributing and re-building the American dream!

Best regards,

Fang
