I strongly agree with the proposal. It is necessary to extend the OPT time for the STEM graduates. 

Because the STEM graduates are important for the IT industry in US. In the IT industry, there is a large demand for the STEM professionals, while, currently there is no enough supply. If we extend the OPT time for STEM students, those professionals can contribute to the US IT industry for a long time, and create more profit for the companies, and also provide more tax for the US government. 

High technology plays a significant role in US economy and people's life. But, we do not have enough US citizens who engage in the IT technology field. So we need to grant longer period of working rights to the international graduates, the STEM graduates. Otherwise, we will lack of labor in IT field, and our life quality will decrease.
