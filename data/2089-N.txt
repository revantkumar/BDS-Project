I don't think the Optional Practical Training program should be expanded because it is not fulfilling its original purpose of training foreign students who would go home and help their home countries. Today it is being used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S. The department of Homeland Security's proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the Optional Practical Training program. Because employers of OPTs don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes on foreign students, they can employ them for less money than their American STEM competitors.
