The OPT is a total fraud against the American citizens. Where as:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

When these foreign 'workers' have completed the program they are suppose to return to their home country and that is Not the case since these trained workers have already sponged Billions of dollars thru this program they Do Not return to their home country But start in bottom rung jobs not at a beginning salary But at the $60-90 K yearly range.

This is a disgrace to the American designed system of hiring and it Must stop.
