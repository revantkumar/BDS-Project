I and my family strongly support the rule, and our reasons are as follows:
1. As a Ph.D. student in STEM major, my talent and education can be used to build the an even stronger economy by working in the US companies when competing with the companies from the other parts of the world.
2. The approval of this rule will encourage more oversea top talented foreign people to have education in this country, as we know, a lot of these students are helping to build the reputation of their schools and even this country. Their coming to this country will also encourage the economy since they have the needs for shopping, rental, and buying cars.
3. This rule will also encourage the tourism industry since the parents or friends of the OPT graduates usually come and visit them, and travel around the country.
4. A lot companies are hiring students with OPT for training purpose even before their working back to their home country, with this rule, the training can be fulfilled in a much better way.

I honestly recommend the officers to have serious consideration over this matter, it is the American Spirit to be open to all talented people, to make this country better. 

Sincerely,
