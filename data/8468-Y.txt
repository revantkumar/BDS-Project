I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. OPT extension gives international students more opportunities to achieve their "American dreams", thus it will attract more and more international students come to the U.S., international students pay much more tuition than native students, this is a very big extra income for American education.

2. There are thousands of international students get their jobs at IT company, they are brilliant and have high educational background, but only 50% of them can get H1B visa every year. If the OPT extension is canceled, the rest of these people will have to leave America immediately. This will be a significant lose to American economy.
