I strongly support the Rule for the following reasons:

First of all, the industries related to Science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), for example, manufacturing, finance, professional services, and trading, are great contributors (around 55%) to the US GDP (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2014 data) . Needless to say the comparative advantage in STEM human resources that help the US to maintain its world leading position. Not only do the industries that are related with STEM, but also the maintaining the US leading position in the world require a lot of hard working employees and researchers in science and high technology field. Highly educated immigrants are great workforce while few citizens is willing to do those tedious works with medium payment. Extending F1 students' serving time will benefit these major GDP driver areas.

Second, the government has already spent a great amount of grants for science and technology every year. And a lot of international students benefit from it (just considering the overwhelming amount of international students in STEM programs). Without the OPT-extension, those students might only serve the US for one year or even leave the U.S. to other advanced countries like Canada directly after their graduation because of unwelcoming policy to international students. It can be an immediate and great loss to the US tax payers because they have spent a lot of money indirectly in grants to support STEM.

Most importantly, those STEM students all experienced high education in the U.S.. They are LEGAL TAX PAYERS and very self-disciplined. They contribute to the economy as much as, if not more, than the most U.S. citizens.

Therefore, I strongly support this new policy.
