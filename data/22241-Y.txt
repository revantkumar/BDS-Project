This is good both for F1 students and for US government.
For F1 students, we can use more time to training and learning.
For US goverment: Some F1 students got their Master or Ph.D. degree by scholarship. Since US. universities spend lots of money on them, Why US government want them leave here. It looks like US spend money and resource to help other countries to educate people. 
Thus, I think we should extanding OPT for F1 students.
