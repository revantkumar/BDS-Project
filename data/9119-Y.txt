I strongly agree the rule because by opt extension, it will let more and more talented foriner to help American's economic growth.
Besides, without these foriners , it will have a negative to american's economy. Because if opt extension stops, a lot of employees working with opt extension have to be laid off. While without these people, a great number of companies can not work.
Besides, employers may not be willing to hire international students because they will think international student will not stay in the company in a long time.
As a result, I hope opt extension can still be there. It will benefit and help American's economy
