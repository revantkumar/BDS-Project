I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..
2. University is very important for the U.S.as a math major student I think there are many international studnets become famous professors after they study at U.S. universoties. So I think give students long time to have a intern or work in U.S. is necessary for U.S. to keep the excellent people from all around the world.
3. Competition does exist but it's not a bad thing. Giving international students more chance to work for U.S. can help U.S. become more competitive.
