I strongly support the OPT STEM extension to 24 months. The reasons are as follows:
1)As a country of immigration, the basis of the establishment of the United States is that each individual, regardless of his race and origin, has equal rights and chances to pursue his own success, while contributing to the wealth of the society. The OPT STEM program ensures that we, international students, have the right and possibility to pursue our career success in the United States. 
2)Many comments talked about foreign STEM students being employed with lower wages. This is not true. Only e-verified employers can hire international STEM students, which means those students have to be qualified academically and be offered the same wages as America STEM students. 
3)The OPT STEM program is a key element of earning practical experience after studying theories from universities. It keeps the U.S. education system competitive among other countries. Cutting off this program will be a major loss for the U.S. education system
4)There are a large portion of students who are in the middle of the OPT extension and being hired by e-verified companies. The cancelation of STEM extension will make these student's stay in the United States illegal. This will be a disaster for many companies who rely on international STEM students, such as the IT companies at the Silicon Valley and engineering companies across the United States.
