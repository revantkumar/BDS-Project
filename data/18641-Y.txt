I strongly support the extension and OPT policy. Hiring a OPT student cost much higher than hiring a citizen. So it would not effect employment of citizens. Companies only will hire OPT student when there is no citizen qualifies the role. For those unemployed citizens, are you qualified for the high-tech role?
