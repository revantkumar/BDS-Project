I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

I pursued a Masters degree in Information Systems from University of Cincinnati and graduated in 2013. The decision of removing STEM OPT extension will abruptly end my current work authorization in Feb 2016. It will not even allow my employer a chance to file H1-b work visa for me. My wife (who works in US) and I are completely baffled about our future due to this decision.

This new proposal to retain and expand the STEM OPT extension is quite a relief since it provides me more time to continue my learning experience in the most technologically advanced part of the world. Id like to quote some numbers to indicate the economic benefits of retaining international students in the United States by each phase:

1.Student tenure:
a.Revenue from nonimmigrant visas in the year 2013 assuming a $300 visa application fee for 9.1 million nonimmigrant visas issued is $2.7 billion. This number grew by 2.6% from 2012 to 2013

b.Tuition fees for international students is almost twice than domestic students. Assuming an average of $25,000 / year in just tuition, for 900,000 international students in 2013-2014 accounts for $22.5 billion. This number grew by 8% from the prior year.

c.Apart from my tuition expenses I spent on an average of $500/month in living/food/travel in Cincinnati. For 900,000 students that would be $5.4 billion in additional spending. Note that this is a very low average compared to larger and more expensive Metro cities like Chic
