I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT.

This proposal embodies the concept of "American Dream". U.S. has a long history of immigration friendly policy which makes this nation thriving and strong. Millions of talents with scientific and technology skills made contribution to U.S. The leading positon of U.S. in the world is largely depends on its dominating status of science, engineering, economics technology. Science and technology is the key to the economics as well. In order to keep the dominating postion of the world and future economy, the government should allow foreign students holding their F-1 visa longer and making more contribution to this nation. Many people complained about the job maketing, actually people who cannot find a job opportunity because they are not competitive, but not from the threat of foreign students. For a short sight, it will make some people without sufficient skills to find a job opportunity. But for a long run, it will make the job market less competitive and if the companies cannot find enough skilled workers, they can out source technology positions outside U.S. like Asia or Europe, the wages paid to other countries will definitely hurt the economy in the U.S. for a long run. Lastly, STEM OPT is important for foreign students. When studying aboard, STEM OPT is an attractive item for foreign students to choose U.S. because they can polish their skills in American companies after graduated from school. If OPT is cancelled, many students will choose other countries like U.K., Australia, China for further study. This actually hurt the development for the higher education in the U.S.

All in all, this proposal will make definitely make U.S. great!
