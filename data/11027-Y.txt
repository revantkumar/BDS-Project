Dear Chief Westerlund,

I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.

The most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students.

The need for the OPT extension is for following reasons:
US needs a larger tech-savvy workforce to maximize economic growth 400,000 stem students 
from 200,000 by 2015 (Doubling of STEM graduates).
Students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in their field of study (Example Solar Energy, Medical Research)
The employers will be getting the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT ( Ex: BIG DATA in IT, Social Networking, Mobile technology) otherwise relying on obsolete technologies
STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.

I strongly commend for this 24 months rule and would urge that a clear path to of absorbing and benefiting from International graduates should be rolled out.
