I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. My husband is an international computer science master student from China and was a software engineer full-time at Kyocera. When he decided to pursue his master degree, he had another chance to stay in China. However, the most important reason he choose to study here is US could provide him the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and my husband probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

In addition, the knowledge from foreign STEM talents of their home country will help those high-tech companies to target the market better. In this way, the higher the revenue those companies can make, the higher employment rate will be for the US employment market, which is double-win for both side.
