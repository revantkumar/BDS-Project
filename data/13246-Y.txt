I approve this new regulation for the following reasons:

1. OPT extension rule is a big, big attraction for foreign students to study in US. Asfar as I know, most foreign students who are studying in US are in STEM major, and one big reason that they choose to study in US is the OPT extension rule. They know they have 29 months to get trained after graduation. If the OPT gets back to 1 year, many foreign students will choose to study in other countries.

2. If you really decide to close the OPT extension, I think you need to notice the students before they came to US. Many students currently studying in US did not know OPT extension will be revoked before they came out. Some of them are even in extension period right now. It would be a disaster for them if the extension is revoked.

3 Foreign students bring so much economy growth in US by tuition and living expense. If we lose those students, we may lose ~$50 billion/year in economy growth.

4 Many of the opponent argues that foreign students steal the job opportunities which belongs to citizens. They are saying that foreign students are underpayed and undereducated. In fact, OPT extension only applies to e-verify company. The companies enroll in e-verify program to show they treat every employee equally without racial/citizenship discrimination. So foreign employee will not get lower salary than local citizen. SO the only example of lower salary is the interns v.s. the employee. But you know foreign students with opt is only a subset of all the interns. I think they are arguing that companies should raise the intern salary, but it has nothing to do with the opt extension rule.
