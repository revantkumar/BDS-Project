Yijing Xiao I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. U.S. has always been a home to talents and hardworking people. Students who come from U.S. and obtain their degree in this country normally needs to go through a selection process. They are talented and hardworking people. Normally its much harder for them to find a job in the U.S. since the selection process for these students are usually more competitive and the level of requirements are much higher.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many scientist that has contributed a lot to the growth of technologies and economy of U.S. are foreigners. They came up with brilliant ideas and make them come true and these ideas has helped U.S. to become a stronger country and also improved the lives of American people. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Many international students are working with a salary much higher than the minimum wage and this actually helped to improve the minimum wage in the district. International students will not compete on jobs with local citizens since they need to go through a much tougher selection process during hiring process in order to get a job in U.S.

4. Companies in the U.S. are growing so fast in the past few years and many of them are starting overseas business. This will require these companies to increase the demand of international employers. Many working positions that international students are working on actually require international sights and skills like multilingual skills and multicultural background. This is not saying that local citizens in the U.S. are not doing so well in learning another language or another culture. This can cultivate a good competitive environment that helps both international employers and local employer to grow.
