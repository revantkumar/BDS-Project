Pedro Tejada I believe that the OPT STEM extension is very valuable for both the international students and the US.

For students, there is a lot of experience that can (only) be gained at a job after school, and that is very useful independently of whether students later stay in the US or leave.

For the US, there is a huge need of people with STEM degrees that is expected to increase, and getting qualified international students can help relieve that need. For many students, it is impossible to apply for the appropriate visas without these OPT extensions.

I got my PhD in Computer Science in December of 2014 and I am currently doing OPT. I want to apply for H1 visa next year, but cannot do it without extension. Talking to the director of development at the company I work for, the need for people is much greater than the number graduated by the universities.

Also, students on OPT are not just learning. They are contributing. At the company I work for, I am doing things that many people don't do, and helping solve problems and develop products.

Moreover, parts of the new proposal, such as requiring students to have degrees from accredited schools and additional oversight, can be very useful. Especially because they can help prevent students without good qualifications from taking jobs which could be done by better prepared individuals, and they can help prevent fraud from employers which do not really have STEM jobs.
