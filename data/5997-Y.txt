I strongly support this rule!!! Definitely, international STEM students contribute so much to the growth of US economy, especially in IT field. Additionally, OPT-extension has no relation with H1b abuse issue, all students with OPT-extension have a BS or MS degree and strong working skills. Certainly, I do agree that it is the time to investigate the background of each H1b application, and only grant working visas to those who are qualified, knowledgeable and intelligent for indeed shortage of the demands in US rather than hiring thousands of cheaper labors.
