Abhijeet Gautam As a foreign student, what brings one to the US is the sheer quality of education that the academia has to offer here. Many such students stay in the academia after obtaining their degrees and keep contributing their bit to help sustain the "Technological and Innovative Edge" that this great country has over the rest of the world. Many students decide to join the workforce thereby contributing to the technology industry which has had a huge impact on the economy of US. I am not sure if anybody would deny this contribution that "foreigners" or "immigrants" have been making to this country. 

I am a Master's student in one of the costliest universities in the country. I would be contributing roughly $120,000 and more to the US economy during my stay as a student. This amount corresponds what an average house hold in the US makes in 2 years. Having mortgaged our parent's and grand parent's lives earnings and property to get top quality education, any opposition to this rule would deny the student community a chance to make a bright future. After all practical knowledge is what the industry runs on. Don't we have the right gain practical knowledge by working in this highly competitive and cutting edge technology industry ?

I would not have considered US as a top destination for my Master's Degree had I not been given an opportunity to learn while working in the industry. It doesn't only help gain an industry experience which is very sought after back home, but also helps us pay back some of the loans that almost 95% of the Master's students studying in the US have to depend on.
I am certain almost each member of the F1 student community would concur to this. 

Denying this opportunity to the F1 Students in the STEM areas, would be a huge set back to the R&D going on in the Tech Industry here in the US and world wide. US would cease to be the beacon that attracts top talent from different corners of the world.
