the OPT extension will not hurt the US employees, as the employer are only allowed to hire F-1 students if there are no other qualified US candidate. 

It will however, hurt the US employer more if this regulation is not realized. when the employee under OPT ran out of OPT time, and they weren't able to get the H1-B visa on time, the employer is forced to lose a great employee.
