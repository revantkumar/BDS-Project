Qiushuo Yu I am a PhD student of Agricultural Economics at University of Connecticut, focusing on international agricultural commodities trade. 

U.S. is the world's largest soybean and corn exporter. We have many Chinese, Korean, India students in our department, all of these countries import different agricultural products and natural resources a lot from U.S. Moreover, the biggest pork process company Smithfield was acquired by Chinese company Shuanghui,International; DFA(Dairy Farmers of America) and Yili set up a joint venture milk powder plant at Kansas with an annual production capacity of 80,000 tonnes. Just to name a few... Those U.S. and multinational companies CAN NOT survival without the most diligent, brilliant international students working for them. Expanding the OPT will definitely help those companies and U.S. economy a lot.
