Stop destroying our country. Stop destroying our country! Immigrants are having more rights than we do. You are giving our rights away over theirs. You are not protecting and giving the best opportunities to our people. The people who are here now and struggling to make ends meet. I hope they would have to pay the same as Americans but not knowing, I would not be surprised if they don't. We need to take care of our own first.
