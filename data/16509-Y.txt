I support this newly promulgated regulation regarding OPT STEM extension. To begin with, America needs international students with professional skills, e.g., computer science to support the whole industry, where demand is way greater than supply. Secondly, if big corporations were deprived those international workers, they are very likely unable to create the working force from American in a short time, which the short labor force will create tremendous problems.

All in all, I support this newly revised regulations.
