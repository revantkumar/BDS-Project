I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. My Professor Pro. Ren was an international student and is now the distinguishe professor in UF and contribute a lot of frontier papers and ideas to our department. Once the proposal is imported, there will be much more imaginative scientists contribute the US!

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. Worldwide economy is never a new topic to the US, but how could a company extend the business without knowing the culture in the local place? They need international employees to negotiate with local government, investigate the peeper emcee of local people!
