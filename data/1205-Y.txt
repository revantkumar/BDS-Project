Personally, I would like to support this new policy for OPT extension with 24 months for the following reasons:

1. Majority of the international students come to U.S. for education are from STEM majors; and OPT extension becomes an attractive factor to bring excellent students to U.S comparing with other countries, which will boost the economical growth of the country from the financial aspect, such as real estate, tourism, and education. For example, the cancellation of OPT extension will result in a significant drop in the amount of money coming to the public colleges and universities, which will negatively influence the education quality.

2. Instead of hijacking the job opportunity from native residents, international students create more job opportunities in the U.S. market. Most of international students from STEM majors are actively serving in different fields of the high-level technology related jobs, assuring the stability and development of the companies' or institutions' businesses, that generates more derivative positions for U.S. residents.

3. Although this new policy seems to increase the competition levels, generally it is a good thing for the country's sustainability and development in the long term. Competition could improve the overall quality of the potential employees for both U.S. and non-U.S. residents. This could make U.S. become more competitive globally.
