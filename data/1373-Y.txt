Gailil Cragg There is no .excuse for companies in this country to hire foreign workers because they will work for less money or because they can't find citizens for the job. We need to train students to do the work that is out there and penalize companies that hire foreigners. We are overloaded with immigrants who refuse to learn our language and expect to be catered to and then we do cater to them. This country is very quickly becoming a 3rd world banana republic. I think that is what this administration wants - they will tell us what to do and we will do it because they will be in charge of the handouts. Fortunately for me, I won't live long enough to see this but I truly fear for my children and grandchildren.
