I strongly support this rule for the following reasons: 1. It will attract more excellent engineers and scientists to stay in US, thus helping US keep its leading role in the realm of science and technology. 2. This will also provide opportunities for intelligent students to set up their own companies, which in turn will provide more jobs for American citizens.
