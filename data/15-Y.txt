I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..
International students looking for job is not stealing native's job at all. Everyone need a way to feed their family and freedom to choose their way and the right to obtain success using their own ability.
