Nonimmigrant students with STEM degree will definitely need an rational extension of opt period in next years, even decades. They always make the most contribution to the development of this whole world. The origin of public welfare should always be the progress of science and technology. And international STEN students are taking the majority of it. I do strongly support this proposal.
