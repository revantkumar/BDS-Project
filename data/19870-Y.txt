I'm a Chinese student and I'm definitely agree with the extension. As a matter of fact, the fee of studying in US is much more than the fees to study in UK, Hongkong, Singapore. But in my university, nearly all the best students choose to study in USA even we have to pay much more. One of the chief reasons is that USA is more friendly to international students and we have more opportunities to find a job and stay here after graduation. If the proposal failed, then we have much less opportunities to get H1B and hence companies would not be willing to hire us. Then why would we pay so much to go to America? USA indeed has the most advanced technology in the world, but for most of us, we would not have the chance to study the most advanced knowledge, after all, all we pursue is a better future. In that case, we would not study here. If the number of students from China decreases significantly, I think the US education system will face a great loss and many companies will have difficulties to maintain the high quality of their technological workers.
