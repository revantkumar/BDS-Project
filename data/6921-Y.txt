Steve Murray This rule is absolutely the right thing to do for the U.S. The nonimmigrant students are talented and well-educated. Most of them have master and phd degrees and they are contributing the most valuable years in the lives to the growth of U.S economy. 

Most of them are working as scientists in universities, as research engineers in companies and software developers in information technology. 

They are crunch in most of the important products that U.S. companies are making, from Apple iphone to Amazon AWS. These products are essential to U.S. economy and they are the reason why the U.S. stand on top of world. 

Ejecting these talented and responsible men out of U.S., is a bad option of the US immigration.
