Deirdre Graham International students contributed almost US$27 billion to the US economy in 2014, which corresponds to a 12% increase versus 2013 when the total was US$24 billion. Technology is what makes America super power in the world. All the American citizens must support this rule. There is no doubt that to advance our economy and our society we need to create the next great technology innovations, not just consume them. That's why there is such urgency for the U.S. to develop a stronger workforce of experts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A.
