Pu Ba I strongly agree that the expansion of OPT is necessary. The primary reason is that the immigration system of United States is broken, especially the H-1b program is unworkable. The current H-1b annual quota is way under the demands, and the lottery system cannot ensure fairness of all foreign students. Before the government works out significant improvements of the H-1b program, they should definitely expand the OPT somehow thus compensate the adverse effects of broken H-1b program. 

Furthermore, the expansion of OPT should be available for all foreign students, not STEM student only.
