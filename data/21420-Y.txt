As the most immigrant friendly country, USA has benefited a lot from its huge immigrant population. Skilled immigrants keep on pumping life into the society by providing advanced technology and less expensive services. This could lead to reduced costs and increased production efficiencies, and thus a virtuous circle. I see no reason of rejecting this proposal, and hope people don't use it as an excuse of being lazy and reject learning new knowledge.
