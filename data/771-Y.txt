Sarah Lee STEM OPT does not take away job opportunities from U.S. resident and instead it might create job opportunities. 

Many US citizens blame that OPT students are taking away job opportunities that belongs to them. That is ridiculous. OPT is optional practical training and serving as a part of university education for international students. US government has imposed many restrictions on STEM OPT students, which leaves them only a small portion of the job market. Restricted by those immigration policies, they have no way to be as competitive in many aspects as an equally good U.S. resident. If a foreign student finally wins a job out from such a competition, that means this student is outstanding and is the person that every country wants. Such talented and outstanding international students are only a small percentage. They might become excellent entrepreneurs and create more job opportunities such as Jerry Yang.
