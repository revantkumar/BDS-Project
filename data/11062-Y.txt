Why do you want to cancel OPT extension ? If we can hire good software developers from American students, we will. However look at these interview review we got, these International students did way better, if you are a HR, do you want to hire somebody who said "I am not good at coding, I am good at social party". Come on, I can't image how terrible it will go if we fire all international employees using OPT. Things may different at different subjects, but please take EVERYONE'S IDEA into consideration !! We need OPT !!
