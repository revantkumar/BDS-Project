I strongly support the proposal,America is a nation of immigrants, many immagrants create great value to our country. In our university, many professors are immigrants, they teach us knowledge to give the chance to create more things in the future.The immigrant students receive the best education in our country, they should work hard to reward our country, they mastered the latest science and technology, they can use what they have learned to promote social and human development,they pay the tax and make contribution to our society.
