I strongly support this ICEB proposed rule because it does good to both US tech companies and citizens. Nowadays tech companies are still in dire need of a large amount of students major in STEM to create value, thus improve the tax income of gov. 
What's more, this extension shows little disturbance to citizens working in other industries and can also benefit citizens working in third industries.
