Anonymous Anonymous 23 years ago, I was called into my bosses office. He told me that my salary would be cut from 65,000 to 45,000 per year or I would be laid-off and an immigrant from India hired to replace me. I worked another year but was continually required to do lots of unpaid overtime under the same threat. I became a stay at home mom instead of working with the constant threats. Won't this program allow companies to more easily make the same threats to older more experienced engineers who are already citizens?
