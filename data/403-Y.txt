Meng Wang I strongly support this rule. This rule benefits both the United States as a country and people living in the US. The US is the most powerful country in the world. How can that happen? One of the important reason is that US universities attracts great F-1 students globally. And US academic institutions is competitive globally because it provides OPT programs which increase the chance for F-1 students to work in US and serve the US. OPT is a great advantage for US. One counter example is Great Britain: my friend who began to study in London School of Economics and Political Science are now back in China right after graduation, because Great Britain don't have OPT policy. If US had no OPT, the international students would just leave after enjoying the educational resource of US, without using what they have learned to help people in US. That would be a great loss for both US as a country and US people. I believe the US government wouldn't weaken their advantage. Instead, the OPT advantage should be enhanced, and the this OPT extension rule is a great point to start with. The OPT extension will attract more international students to work on science and technology related industries, and that will essentially help to improve US economy and strength.
