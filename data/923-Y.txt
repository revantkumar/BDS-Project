Vanessa Tang I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for F1 STEM students. Firstly, I think cultural diversity is really important and crucial in this globalized era, especially in the US where people are from all over the world. There are great people in the US who have made a lot of important contribution to this world and they were international students before. US really needs such diversity. Secondly, in terms of competition, it does exist and it will exist even though there are no international students here. Competition is a good thing and it makes people become better. Also, many international students do not compete with US citizens for jobs. On the contrary, international students usually work for positions that can't find enough suitable candidates from US citizens. Competition would improve the whole quality of workers, no matter they are international or local, which would further improve the competing power of the US compared to other countries. I really hope this proposal would get approved and we want to live in the competitive US. Thanks!
