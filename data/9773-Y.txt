I strongly SUPPORT the new rule for STEM program students. Diverisity and fairness are spirit of U.S., it's not only apply to American but to everyone who lives on this land. On the other hand, the STEM students obtained their degree in U.S. Education system, it makes no sense to stop them making contribution to this country with their knowledge .
