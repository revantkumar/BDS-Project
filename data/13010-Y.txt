I really appreciate the new policy that DHS proposed for OPT extension. 
The H1B cap has become more and more difficult to obtain. As an international student that just started work, I have been feeling the pressure of H1B cap ever since I graduated. The visa problem has highly affected my career plan from different prospectives, from job selection to the decision about staying in US or not. I also know lot of friends going back homeland due to the VISA problem. Therefore, I am really happy to see that DHS starts to release the VISA requirement for us international students in US. Thanks!
