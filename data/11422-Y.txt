It is true that we students need 24 months to participate in practical training in engineering field. I am an engineering student, as far as I know, it is nearly impossible for someone to make big breakthrough in a project of one year. As engineering project is very complex, you need time to configure environment and to do research preparation. One year is defiantly not enough.
