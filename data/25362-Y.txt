I fully agree with this proposal since I am a F1 STEM student right now. 

This extension of OPT may help international students to make full use of their knowledge in real business occasion. Besides, STEM student are the ones who are needed in US (That is why called STEM). The extension of OPT make it possible for us to work for a longer time in US and to contribute to the US economy. Also, more working opportunities attracts more students studying in US, which means more income to the universities in US.

All in all, I would be glad if this proposal is implemented, which is a win-win for both students and US government.
