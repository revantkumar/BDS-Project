I oppose this.....we graduate plenty to apply for these jobs. This obviously is just another ploy to drive down wages and favor foreign students over American...it also breaks the pledge these students take TO LEAVE when the training is over....but we all know once someone sets foot on American soil they will never leave and no one here will make them....a nation of laws....right, but absolutely useless unless enforced.
