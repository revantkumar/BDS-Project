Thank you DHS for coming up with such an excellent proposal. I completely support this as it will ultimately provide boost to the US Economy,
F1 students with STEM degree constitute a major portion of Technological workforce in US and it will start impacting the US market if employers loose them in such competitive world.
Looking at the increasing number of H1 application every year I would like to suggest to increase STEM OPT to 36 months from 24 so that F1 students can have more chances at H1 Lottery.
