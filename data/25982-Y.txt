I am a student who is about to apply for STEM extension. I am really relieved that DHS is retaining and increasing the length of OPT period. This will help us focus more on the studies and work than constantly worrying about our visa status.
Those who plan to apply for H1B visa will also benefit from this as it is getting tougher every year to get H1B in the first attempt. I hope there will be some improvement on that front too.
24 months is quite an ideal time frame and it should not be extended or reduced.
