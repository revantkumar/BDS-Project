I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international applied master student from China. The most important reason I choose to study here is that US could provide me industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. 

So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. BTW, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents. 

I will go back to China eventually. However, I do want a US working experience to make myself more competitive when I go back. Right now in China, US degrees only are no longer that charming to the industry company while US working experience make oneself competitive.
