Please oppose any regulation that takes away from the hometown team. I think it's great that immigrants come here LEGALLY to learn, but when you give them more opportunity to stay after they have learned, you take take away from the kids that are born and raised here. Keep on the job training open to American citizens and you keep our kids close to home. Please put locals first. Our own children should be more important than anything in the world. The law already allows for immigrants to stay longer than originally planned. Don't add salt to the wound.
