I support the proposed rule. As any effort trying to confine domestic job market competition will backfire in the long run due to the ever-increasing globalization. Those international students with expertise in STEM area will find job in other rapidly growing market/regions or countries if they are denied the chance to pursue working experience here in the US. In a long term this will hurt the competitiveness of the US companies and domestic job market. One should think about how many job openings for citizens are created by innovation led by foreign students/workers in these areas. Besides, the higher education, being a critical source of income for schools and local government nowadays will be hit hard if large pool of international students get turned away to other countries. This WILL happen if OPT is cancelled. Therefore, I support this proposal.
