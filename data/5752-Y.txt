merry song As an international student, I might not be eloquent as natives, but what we really want to say is that, we really wish we could have more opportunities to make a contribution to this wonderful nation. Many of us spent years in states, immersed in states' culture, learnt from states, and also bringing our own culture to this nation of freedom. We would love to make our own contribution to this nation, who has taught us so much. All of my native classmates, they would not mind us studying in the same classroom, competing to work for a better solution to a problem provided by a professor who might also come from another different country, since we are all helping each us to do better. Why this could not be the case, when we could have an opportunity to work with natives and to make each other a better self.
