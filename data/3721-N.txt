It is a documented fact that your program, OPT, denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

Over the past several years the federal government publicized fictions that there simply were not enough Americans qualified in the STEM areas of employment.

I would like you to comment in detail why you as a department in the United States Federal Government should not be considered:
Subversive for denying American workers jobs,
How you can under any interpretation of the constitution divert jobs to foreign nationals from Americans without being held accountable for sedition,
How you can guarantee the safety of American Citizens against criminal actions that could be initiated by foreign participants in the OPT program considering there are thousands to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants in the country that originally entered under Visa programs that you cannot find even though they commit criminal acts against American Citizens,
How you can not be charged with committing economic warfare against the US government when your actions undermine the funding of the Social Security system and the Medicare system.

I will be interested in your complete answers.
