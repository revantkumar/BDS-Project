I strongly support this rule for what it will bring to both U.S. and nonimmigrant students.
For U.S.
A healthy competitive environment is based on the appropriate rules.Though the rule may have uncertain effects on taking up occupations for local people,to whole,the diversity of talented people can moderately stimulate the competition in getting a job and bring the increase of domestic product.Actually it will make jobs more,and form a virtuous circle.Disapproval of this rule is so conservative that it seems abrupt in this immigrant-friendly culture.

For nonimmigrant students:
So exciting the news it is for the nonimmigrant students if it is approved.24-month extension can increase the possibility to get H1B,and effectively decrease the phenomenon that a student with excellent offers have to leave U.S.,which is a loss to both sides.
