Ming Gao I have to say that the extension of STEM degrees should be done long time ago. The U.S. economy will be become much more better and stronger if more and more stem student stay in America longer. 

Most of the STEM graduates will be work at high tech company and their taxes can contribute to social security, Medi-Cal, CA disabilities, etc. Overall, more STEM graduates means better U.S economy, better U.S. economy means more new employments. Again, thank you Obama and the administration.
