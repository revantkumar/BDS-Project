Some people thinks many Americans that are unemployed because of two many students? Think about how many job opportunities added because of thousands of international students study in U.S. And they pay their tuition more than twice as American native students for the same degree and same school. So they are creating thousands job opportunities!!!

For the those jobs they take after they graduate, most of those jobs are the unemployed American can not take. I believe if an American and an international students have the similar education and apply the same position, the American should gain the chance since he don't need OPT or H1B support at all. So if no enough technological people in US can meet the requirement the job position, then the companies should be closed if no STEM OPT for the international students, right?, then which will reduce a lot of job opportunities for Americans in return.
