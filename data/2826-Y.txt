I give my full support to pass the proposed rule on OPT STEM extension. We all know that STEM graduates with PhD and Master degrees are important to technological innovation and job creation in United States. President Obama is committed to attracting and retaining highly-skilled immigrants and the OPT STEM program allows the opportunity for these highly-skilled talents to remain in US after graduation. Therefore, educating and retaining the best and brightest people in STEM fields remains an important priority for this country. Companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. rely heavily on STEM graduates to fill in positions, keep making innovations, and creating economic growth for the country. If the proposed rule were to be revoked, it would be a huge loss to this country because these highly skilled talents will have to return to their own country and work for our competitors using the knowledge they gained from US higher education. In summary, I highly urge the government to pass the new rule and provide further support for the graduates with STEMS backgrounds.
