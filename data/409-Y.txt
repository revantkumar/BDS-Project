I strongly support this rule.

1. STEM foreign students have contributed tremendously to high tech industry. There are simply insufficient number of *eligible* citizens.

2. While the STEM foreign students do not pay SS and medicare tax, usually their ultimate goals are to have H1-B visa, during which time they will pay SS and medicare tax as well. In tech industry, they have a large salary and pay considerable amount of tax.
