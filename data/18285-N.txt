OPT participant F-1 holders get paid less by employers than American workers so the employers prefer them. this sends American workers looking for jobs in other areas guaranteeing that the supposed deficit in qualified American workers for computer Science jobs is true. It is not true Americans want these jobs. Disney laid off their people in Florida to hire cheaper foreign labor and forced the skilled employees to train those morons or lose their severance packages. What choice is that? You can not justify the continuance of this theft of American jobs. I strongly protest this program.
