What truly makes US great is the innovation and advanced technology.

Those American educated STEM students who have completed their advanced degree could really move the momentum of innovation forward. Around 40% key founders in the Silicon Valley start-ups are immigrants. It is a "Win-Win" situation for the US economics and STEM students. More opportunities for STEM students, more innovation in technology and science,and thus more jobs and profit for US economics. 

However, I do agree that we should stop the abuse of this rule. We ought to fix the H1b and L1 program that are monopolized by companies such as Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and HCL.
