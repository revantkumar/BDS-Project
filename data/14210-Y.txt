My beautiful unbelievable daughter in law came across the border from Mexico almost thirty years ago now trying to escape an oppressive and abusive marriage.
She was eight months pregnant with her first child and trying to provide a better life for them both.
She was caught and sent back on her second attempt she made it .
When her daughter was two she met my son.
That girl now 28 has never known another father.
My daughter in law is an RN has three degrees and is working on her doctorate had she not been given the opportunity to educate herself she wold still be struggling.
Let's give these people a chance at making their lives better they come here to the US in the hope they will do sit that they fight for our country so let's give back to them.
