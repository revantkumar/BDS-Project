I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. For international students, the reason why they choose the United States is that USA provides the industry training opportunity during college or after graduation. This is an attractive aspect for American academic sector. Therefore, OPT extension is very important to attract foreign talents to study at. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and international student would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. As said in the regulation: U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. Many companies focus on group of diversity. How to achieve diversity? Companies need employees with different backgrounds and cultures. In this way, the companies can benefit from group of diversity. Right now, many companies in the United States are global companies. Companies can learn foreign market trends from their employees. It can make significant contributions to US economy. Therefore, OPT extension is a necessary rule to the United States.
