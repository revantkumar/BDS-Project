I am an international students from China. I think the policy to extend OPT for STEM students will benefit the US people and government. I spent my last summer in the Bay Area, I found lots of talented colleagues from China, India and lots of other developing countries. Those people play important roles in developing high technology products for the United States. 
To extend OPT will attract more young professional people to surve for the United States.
