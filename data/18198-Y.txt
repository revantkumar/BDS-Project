We are against any outside workers from other countries being allowed into our country the United States without congressional approval. We need to control these out of control companies that want to profit at the expense of our native born citizens. If you need people with certain skills hire the ones in our country first and then train more citizens that want to work before anyone even considers bringing in outside people from other countries.
