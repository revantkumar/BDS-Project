Aileen Wang I really can't see any good reasons against this proposal. It's always been freedom that brought us to where we are today. Only fair competition can select the best for civilization or revolution. Employers should be given the right to hire those who can contribute the most to their mission and shareholder goals, and thus the benefit of thousands of employees and customers and citizens, regardless of the candidates' race, gender, or nationality.
It sounds ridiculous that till today, we are still having debates about how to protect those who are lazy and just want to be sheltered by the government, only for the sake of being born on this land. Every human being is born equal. Setting any kind of bans against flow of capital or labor will only reduce efficiency. Though it's hard in practice to remove all at one time, we should only talk about how fast we shall move towards the ideal condition, rather than should or should not strive to reach there.
