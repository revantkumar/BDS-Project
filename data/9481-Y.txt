Deirdre Ellison By 2017, the global middle class is projected to increase its spending on educational products and services by nearly 50% - from US$4.4 trillion in 2012 to US$6.2 trillion. This rule is not taking away any job from us. In fact because of this rule more and more jobs are being created for American citizen with or without degree in STEM field. One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
