I'm totally for this proposal about improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. The following three view points are proving that this is definitely a win-win case:

1. The companies in the US can get benefit from this proposal. Due the large volume of high-quality international students, the technology firms and the technology division of non-technology firms have much more choices when they hire, and the candidates are from all over the world (and now at universities in the US). And because the firms have much more choices, they have more chance to hire the best fit for their job openings, and bring better profit for their firms.

2. Most of the STEM major international students are with very good professional ability, and hard-working, giving them chance to work in the US is apparently doing good to this country, i.e. this country will have more talented people from all round the world to help improve her industry and economy.

3. The US is a very energetic country, and has a lot of great companies and working opportunities, there is really unnecessary to worry international students would hurt the chance of being hired of a US citizen, I mean, if a US citizen is qualified for a job, there is no reason for a firm in the US to hire an international students, even there is OPT and OPT extension for the STEM degree F-1 students. So no matter STEM degree students have the OPT extension or not, it wouldn't hurt the chance of getting employed for a US citizen.

Above all, approval for this OPT extension proposal is totally a win-win case.
