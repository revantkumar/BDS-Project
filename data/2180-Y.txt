I work for information technology industry, where international students and contributors plays an important role. 
The approval of this proposal is necessary to keep this industry productive and creative, and it would be also helpful to keep American's technology ahead of other countries. 
We should give a equal opportunity to every international students, and let job market but not regulation to decide who are eligible to stay.

As a conclusion, I highly support the APPROVAL of the proposal.
