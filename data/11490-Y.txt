I strongly support the new 24 Month STEM OPT Extension. This new rule would be beneficial to both the students and the US. If the STEM OPT Extension rule is revoked then there won't be any international student coming to the US to pursue higher studies which in turn would affect the economy of the US. 12 month OPT would do no good to students or the US, so I heart-fully wish the new 24 Month STEM OPT Extension should pass.
