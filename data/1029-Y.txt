As a citizen, I would state to support the extension and even the expanding of OPT. I've been working with some international students after my graduation. Through my work, I can tell that they are very talented people and high-qualified employees for my company. I think they deserve the right to stay in this country and work in the field that they expert in. Their thoughts, their culture, their intelligence have brought great contribution, at least to my company. I could not imagine how our company, and those companies that require similar expertise from these people will survive if these talented people are forced to leave the country. We should definitely keep them.
