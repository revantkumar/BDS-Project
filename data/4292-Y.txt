I totally SUPPORT this new OPT extension proposal. I believe that this new rule can bring more international students to come to States for studying in STEM fields. Because a lot of students can get their job at States during extension period. More international students means more income to the States and smart person working here means that the States becomes more powerful. States can gain a lot from this rule. So I support this rules.
