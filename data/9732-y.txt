Please do expand the availability of OPT for foreign students. This proposal is based on the fact that there is a severe shortage of workers educated or trained science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. I am a Ph.D. student in physics. In my experience in graduate school, I have learned first-hand that there is an absolutely shortage, of Americans interested in these fields. When I was working on my Master's Degree, I was in a program where I saw a number of companies who could not hire very qualified Americans and had to hire strong and excellent international students, and it is OPT and OPT extension that allow international students work here and contribute to United States. Also, more than 40% of the graduate students in that department where I got my Master's were foreign. The inescapable conclusion from this was that Americans who are interested in STEM fields are too few and many companies have to resort to foreign students. Job opportunity for Americans cannot be affected by international students. 

According to Sen. Grassley, "By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 years, in consistent with Congressional intent." There is clearly urgant need for an expansion of OPT, and doing so would economically benefit Americans and serve as a strong incentive to American students to enter STEM fields.
