This is an absolutely awesome policy.
I recalled the history of China, the last imperial dynasty of China is Great Qing, which held a policy called closed-door policy. It cut off China from the outside world as well as closed peoples visions and minds. Isolation means, in future, death and ruin of the country. The Great Qing was forced to sign lots of unequal treaties, free trade, and treaty ports under foreign control. This demonstrated any seclusion policy wont bring any prosperity to a country. 
Nowadays, USA, as the most powerful country in the world, should also bring out a relatively open policy in my opinion. The extension of OPT will benefit this country in the near future.
