I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First of all, if the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country, they will keep making contributions to the country. They will do some jobs and fill in some positions that American students don't want to do. 
Secondly, Diversity is very important for the U.S. It will make the U.S. University more attractive to foreign students, and more importantly, many foreign students make big achievements in U.S. after graduation, especially in biology, chemistry and IT.
Thirdly, competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.
In summary, I strongly support the proposal and I believe it will make U.S. in great progress.
