This rule is completely unfair and gives foreign students a huge extended period to work in this country without contributing to social security and many other taxes. This also displaces many US citizens who are qualified and looking to enter STEM fields.
If you search facebook and other social media, there are posts going around asking people (not just in US, but even overseas) to submit comments FOR this rule. So you have a bunch of comments on this page from all over the world. How is this fair? US citizens are outnumbered by all of the others and comments on this site come from all over.
Please use common sense and fair practices and do not allow this rule.
