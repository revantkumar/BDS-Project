I fully support the proposed rule by DHS. As an international student, I am highly delighted to have more opportunities to extend my knowledge beyond what is learnt at school. This rule grants me such opportunities. While this rule is not only beneficial to nonimmigrant students like me, but also the whole US will benefit from this. The STEM disciplines are foundations for the prosperity of US economy and the people's social welfare. Huge amount of openings in STEM are there waiting in the job market. We fill in some of the job positions and make contributions to the US society. Once again, I am in great favor of this proposed rule.
