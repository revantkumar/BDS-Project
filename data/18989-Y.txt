I think the OPT extension is necessary to help USA maintain core competitiveness in STEM fields. It is pretty obviously that there is significant portion of economy growth was driven by high-tech developing, which is strongly correlated to STEM major fields. A good example is the dynamic economic growth on San Francisco Bay Area. On the other hand, the population of high qualified US citizen/green card graduates is far less than the employment demands of STEM major students, which the foreign students in those fields could be the extra but essential driver of US economy on that field. As far as i know, those high qualified foreign students in STEM major own a much much higher salary level than US average, which means average US citizens couldn't be qualified for such positions even without foreign students. In fact, the growth of high tech driven by high tech foreign students created much more employment opportunities for USA than the position they occupied and they also paid a relatively high tax rate to support US society. I think the OPT extension is a very good and effective way to select those best and qualified STEM foreigner graduates to make contribution to the US economy growth and create benefits to everybody in the country, which has being the way how US kept it's core competitiveness capacity and led the world.
