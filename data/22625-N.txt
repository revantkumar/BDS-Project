MY HUSBAND AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THIS OBAMA GOVERNMENT IS REPEATEDLY TREATING FOREIGNERS AS GUESTS OF GREAT HONOR WHILE IGNORING THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO ARE JOBLESS
AND ON FOOD STAMPS. FOR ONCE, WE AGREE WITH THE UNIONS. THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE! 

WHEN ARE YOU OBAMA PEOPLE GOING TO START OFFERING ALL THESE GIFTS AND PRIZES TO AMERICAN 
CITIZENS? 

WHY ARE TAXPAYERS EDUCATING AND GIFTING FOREIGNERS WITH JOBS AND SKILLS? YOU WOULDN'T SIGN OFF ON THE XL PIPE-LINE. THE STIMULUS WAS A BUST, AS WE ALL KNEW IT WOULD BE. YOU PEOPLE OWE AMERICANS--NOT THE DAMN FOREIGNERS!
