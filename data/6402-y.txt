Swati Adhikarla I pursued a stem degree and graduated with a masters degree in the field of data science. I was more than glad to see the new proposed opt rule.And I truly believe opt stem extension should be retained for the benefit of the stem system. I believe, hands on experience is as important as the theoretical experience, in fact in some cases hands on experience is more important as the industry wants skilled people to cater to different needs. And I think this stem extension experimental learning will provide all round learning experience for the international students. These benefits will certainly encourage upcoming international students to join and benefit from stem programs. Not only does the student benefits from the all round learning but also the system and the industry benefits. Industry gets new perspectives to see and solve the problems, bringing in new businesses. This eventually pumps more money into the country and creates jobs. In my views workers do not compete for fixed number of jobs. Skilled immigrants along with native horns contribute to the US economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for the explanation of the economy.
With this comment I can only say that things will change for better by implementing this rule. And I completely support this rule.
