I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. I believe it is a win-win strategy for both US and international student, especially for US. Lets think about it. 
1.It is shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation. Yes, rejecting international students would gain us a short-term, illusive relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people and would cause the US to gradually lose the advantages in the science and technology. 
2.International students are making huge contributions to our country. We have to admit that most of them are among the best in scientific and technology fields. As we known, these fields are critical for US. This is the major reason to keep US as strongest country in the world. How nave you think our country can keep No 1 forever in the world without the support of science and technology. 
3.Ok, today we thought international students participation in the job market itself would increase competition. Lets deprive their legal right to work. Then what we got to do next? Deprive womens right to work to relieve competition? And then Deprive the right of anyone who are older than 60 year-old? Lets think about what kind of people we will have at the last. 
It is the GOVERMENTSS RESPONSIBILITY to provide a freedom environment and encourage people make maximum contribution to our country.
