It's a fact that high skilled immigrants and foreign nationals who have studied in STEM majors in the US have played an important role in the US tech and engineering industries. For example, UC Berkeley, in a study in 1999, showed that a quarter of start ups in silicon valley were founded by immigrants and those foreign nationals who studied in the US in STEM programs. In the following decade it became a nationwide trend. Also, in 2005, the same extended study showed that these new founded companies in the engineering and tech sector generated over $52 billion of revenue and employed over 450,000 people which is far greater than the number of foreign workers (including those who studied here) which US admitted between 1995 and 2005. 
So, it it is really important that we debunk the myth that international students, after their graduation, are replacing the US work force in fact in a long run, they are the key source of technological paradigm shift and business competitiveness which US is looking for. I highly support the OPT Extension rule for them.
