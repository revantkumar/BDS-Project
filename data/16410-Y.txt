Personally speaking I don't have extra feeling to those guys who need this extension. I just want to speak out some of my thinking sat the bottom of my heart. As a citizen I deeply realized my country is becoming more and more mean to this world. We used to have such great achievements and contributed so much for the human beings. Over a century we are the leader of this world, but now we are losing the crown on our head because we are not a country who can attract smart people from all over the world. Someone is against this new policy, I think they are so radiculous. They are not real Americans and they don't want our country to be great again. They are nearsighted. America doesn't lack oil, America doesn't lack fortune, America lacks brilliant people working for it.and now we are still trying to drive brilliant people out of this country. This will harm this country and our culture, economics in the long run. So stop against this policy and let it get approved.
