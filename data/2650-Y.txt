I cannot support this extension more as it will potentially be the most important and influential decision to international students in the US. As a STEM student myself, it is crucial for me to be able to have two years of working period in the US. If I decided not to go to graduate school directly, two years of working experience will not only enable me to find a more suitable job in the distant future, but also help my study in graduate school in the near future. As I wish to stay in the US as a researcher, it is important for me to know my expertise better to make further contributions.
