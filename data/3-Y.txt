I am a HUGE SUPPORTER of STEM extension.

American is the most powerful country because our nation takes the best of all that GOD has given to the world. Each year foreign students and scholars come to US for education and conference. Our great nation should always keep open to those talents, especially for those technical engineers workers (with a so-called STEM degrees). 

Diversity keeps our society dynamic and creative. I come to New York from China when I was 12. It is still amazing and beneficial that I can experience the whole world culture just from my small high school in town.

I saw some comments which are over addressing the privilege of citizenship. No discrimination on immigrants! My mom and dad are new immigrants. Most of American have a immigrant ancestor, including those guys who left terrible comments. Thats who we are, an immigration country.

Let us keep talents in US!!!
