I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. As a graduated student in STEM major, I hope to have more opposites and time to apply my skills and acknowledges in real industry and make contributions to my employers in United State. 

2. My employer also believe that keeping diversified cultures, skills and backgrounds from employees is the best way to promote the improvement of the company. The OPT extension is the basic guarantee to attract high education background employees. 

3. STEM students should be provided a fairer environment in job market. Without OPT extension, I have only one year opportunity to apply H1 Visa even I got a full time position. It is very limited and really influence my work and life in United State.
