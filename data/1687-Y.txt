I totally SUPPORT this proposed rule.

One thing to be clear is that the ones who benefit from this rule would also contribute more to this country. There are plenty of tech companies. And from what I have experienced, if non-citizens and citizens are competing for the same role, chances are citizens would get the job. However, only a few citizens would like to study in STEM majors. Instead, they would prefer being doctors, lawyers, politicians, teachers etc. So not only these foreign students need to work in those companies, those companies need these students as well. Just think what would happen if all major tech companies let go of all non-citizens. A real nightmare will begin. Without the contribution these STEM students make, soon there won't be enough profits produced in these companies. Then what? 

This country becomes a great one not by shutting its door to foreign people. On the contrary, this country fought its way out by taking all peoples from the world. 

This rule is a win-win to both sides. I really hope this rule could pass.
