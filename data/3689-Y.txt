YES I SUPPORT this new proposal.

We of course want to attract the best talents around the world to work for companies in the States. With this new proposal, our companies would have more chance and less restriction to hire qualified people to create a better future for our country.

As far as I am concerned, US based companies are always short for qualified workers, especially for those small or medium ones. This proposal is very beneficial to increase the chance of talented people to stay in our country and assist to the development of our economy.

This also helps improve the diversity and openness in our country as many international students DO come from minority groups and bring more fresh opinions and energy to our community.
