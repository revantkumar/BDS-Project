Yvonne Wang Most foreign students tried their best to be admitted by universities in U.S., spending a lot of money and energy, so why they can't a fair chance to get a job on this continent if they are good enough? Plus, did they really grab a lot of resources? As I know it is extremely hard to even get a intern for foreign students after graduation. 
I really don't think people who disagree with this policy and also don't have a good job were beated in an interview by a Chinese or Indian.
