I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I am an international student. I would return back to my country one day. But I would like to have chance to work in the States for a few years after I graduate. First of all, I would like to apply what I learned to high-tech industry development in US. Second, if I have working experience for about 3 years in US, i would be more competitive in the job market. All in all, this new OPT extension rule would benefit not only international students but also US high-tech industry.
