To whom it may concern, 

As a F-1 non-immigrant student myself, I'm currently working at a local engineering consultant firm as full-time employee. I think it is a reasonable and great policy. Not only it gives the recent graduates decent amount of time to legally work in the US without worrying about applying to a H1B visa, but also make a better distinction between the OPT and H1B. That means for people who only want to gain some hand-on experience and go back to their country can just stay with their F-1 OPT status, which could potentially reduce the amount of H1B applicants each year. For STEM major student especially, with extended time, I would gain more experience practicing civil engineer without applying for a work visa.
