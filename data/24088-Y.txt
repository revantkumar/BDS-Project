This proposal is quite reasonable and necessary. For F-1 students, learning is not everything we would consider when it comes to deciding whether or not leave our home and study abroad . Without proper application of the knowledge that are acquired in campus, we cannot say we gain anything much more valuable here than staying in our own country. OPT provide us valuable opportunity to grow and get to know the cutting-edge stuff in all kinds of area, which sometimes is even more meaningful than what we learned in classes. Therefore, I vote for the 24 month extension of OPT for stem students.
