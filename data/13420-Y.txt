I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reason:

1. The government should allow the students who learned knowledge from America stay and making contributions to the U.S. 
Students are the most creative and motive ones in the their filed, they are full of energy. the government should make them useful!!!!!

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International students is not a threaten for American citizens. They got jobs because they fit the position.
Most of the international students works as hard as American citizens, they can bring good competition which will push the industry develop and move to a higher level faster.

3. International students will be the best connection between U.S. and the world. But they can not do that only as a student. they need real experience, understanding and connections to be a good bridge and bring more value to the U.S.
