I strongly support the new OPT extension policy. Don't listen to those stupid people who alert that foreigners will take away the jobs from Americans. I am a IT manager working in San Francisco for over thirty years, no matter you believe or not if there is no those smart immigrants who contribute their intelligent to this country there is no Silicon Valley today. Some people claim that we have low employment rate because jobs are token sways by international students. Come on. They are the best "product" made by this country. We should try our best to ensure them stay here and contribute to this country. Look at NASA and numberless other academic organization, we are the leader of the world because we have the most intelligent people working for us. If this policy not approved I can't image what a big loss for US this is. So stop posting any negative comment anymore.
