The OPT program is definitely beneficial for both U.S. employers, foreign students and the whole nation's development. It is the most important way to attract people from the whole world, devoting their skills, intelligence and ambition to this country. If this program cannot be extended, tens of thousands talented international OPT employees will have to leave this country immediately, which is not only a pity for each of them, but also a tremendous loss for United States, a loss of one of the most critical factors making this country powerful.
