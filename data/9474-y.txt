Hebing Liu As we all know that technology is what makes a country strong, getting more and more people prepared with tons of knowledge and skills is definitely important for any country, especially the United States.
We students are staying here in the states not only because of the top facilities, but also because of great chances to develop here.
However, some of the most talented students fail to stay here and make the most of themselves because of their bad luck in getting H1 working visas, which is unfortunately for both the student side and USA. For the students, they no longer have a chance to use the resources to try to be the top of whatever field they were going to stay in, and for the country, they lose people so special that they might regret one day. And think about this, if the people fail to find jobs to stay here in the states due to the shortness of time they have to look for jobs or to get their visas, what they have to do ultimately is to go back to China or go to other countries to find jobs. They might not have as good resources as the companies here do, but the geniuses will shine wherever they stay.
So I think it is definitely necessary for the government to support to make the 24-month waiting time for STEM legal!
Thank you!
