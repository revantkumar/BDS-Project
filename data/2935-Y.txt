To whom it may concern,

I think this 24-month extension is very helpful for STEM students to utilize their knowledge, especially they learned from the U.S. institutions, to contribution to the U.S. economy. I do not understand why the U.S. government, institutions and labs spent so much money and energy to develop these STEM students, and then let them go back to their own countries. What is the benefit for U.S. government?
