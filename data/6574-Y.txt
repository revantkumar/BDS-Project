Carrie Henderson -The proposed rule changes the STEM OPT extension from 17 to 24 months so that a STEM student could have up to 36 months of OPT. The basis of this is cited as NSF funding which typically funds projects through grants for up to three years. While this is true, it's important to consider that few students are able to start their employment immediately upon the start of their OPT authorization - they have to have time to actually find such jobs - and others change employers. It makes more sense, in my opinion, to allow a STEM extension of 30 or 36 months, for a total of up to 48 months max of employment.
-Under the propose rule, students would be eligible for two STEM extensions. Since the STEM extension is only available upon the attainment of a Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate degree, why not just simplify the matter and say that students can have the STEM OPT extension once per education level? 
-It seems strange that students on 12-month OPT don't do any type of training or mentoring plan but they must do it in order to start their STEM OPT. I'm concerned about employers being frightened off by the burden this proposed rule puts on them, especially if every change in compensation and supervision must be reported. Why not have the students self-report? 
-How will DSO's be able to recommend STEM extension in SEVIS for a previous degree, especially if that degree wasn't done our institution? A major update to SEVIS will be needed immediately if this rule is adopted. 
-120 days of unemployment should be allowed during initial 12 months OPT period to allow the student sufficient time to secure employment. 90 days simply isn't enough.
-Would transitional students mentioned in Section V. Discussion of Elements of the STEM OPT Extension have to pay $380 and obtain new EAD? Perhaps their OPT could be automatically extended from 17 to 24 months through a SEVIS update?
-Students with the cap-gap extension of OPT and a pending STEM extension constantly find themselves unable to renew their driver's license without a valid EAD. Is there any way that this issue could somehow be addressed? Could they have the option of applying for a new EAD so they could renew their driver's license?
-The distinction between STEM and non-STEM is often arbitrary. Management Information Systems is not designated as STEM but Information Technology and Management Science are. General psychology is not STEM but Comparative, Experimental, Personality, and Social psychology are. I think the STEM designation needs to be expanded so as to include majors like MIS and Economics.
-"The student would be required to prepare a formalized Mentoring and training Plan with the employer and to submit the plan to the student's DSO before the DSO could recommend a STEM OPT extension in the student's SEVIS record. This would generally provide review of the Mentoring and Training Plan by the educational institution granting the degree related to the training." In cases where the student intends to use the newly proposed option of requesting an extension based on a previously obtained degree, the review would come from the institution that provided the student's most recent degree (i.e., the institution whose official is certifying, based on SEVIS or official transcripts, that a prior STEM degree enable the student to continue his or her eligibility for the practical training." Does this mean that the DSO is responsible for reviewing this, or would it be the department's responsibility? I don't feel qualified to review a Mentoring and Training Plan and determine whether or not it is adequate. What exactly are we reviewing? Furthermore, how can our institution review a Mentoring and Training Plan for STEM OPT granted for a program completed at a different institution, especially if we don't offer the same program? 
-"DHS plans to incorporate the submission of the Mentoring and Training Plan into SEVIS at a later date." It took 8 years for SEVIS to be updated to include employment start and end dates (actually, this hasn't happened yet but is supposed to occur with the SEVIS 6.23 Release). How long is it going to take for SEVIS to be able to incorporate the Mentoring and Training Plan?
