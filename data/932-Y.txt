Qiyou Liu I am a Chinese student here at US. And I am choosing to come to us mainly because of the original friendly environment for international students to get technical training and research training even after graduation.

I gave up full fellowship to study in HongKong, although its closer to my home and having a lot of opportunities as well. And the main concern there is that I can't stay in Hongkong to continue my research and get extensive training! If the extension policy is cancelled, I would suggest the majority of students like me to study elsewhere. It is absolutely worthless to engaged in a project at US and can't even finish it. 

Just to let people know, researches and even relatively small projects in STEM area(mine is electoral engineering if you are curious)may take 1 to 2 years. With a period as short as one year, nothing will come out except a broken and messy system.
