Peter Shin I fully support extending the OPT period to 24 months. The US is lucky enough to be able to attract the best and brightest in the world, and we're lucky that so many talented people want to study here. The US has always been the paragon of acceptance and diversity, and it only makes sense that we allow these F-1 students to make the most of their time here, otherwise we are losing out on their future contributions by making them return to their home country.
