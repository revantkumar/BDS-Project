I strongly support OPT extension!

Everyone living in the U.S. is an immigrant. Every one migrated to this region of the world, whether it was 5 years ago, 50 years ago, 500 years ago, or 15,000 years ago. And the vast majority of us have been brought over to do the work which creates the diversity and wealth of this society.

A number of commenters, however, objected to the 17-month STEM OPT extension on the basis of potential negative impacts on U.S. workers in STEM fields. Some commenters specifically stated that employers would prefer to hire F-1 students on STEM OPT extensions because these students would work for lower wages. This is ridiculous since DHS has ensured that employers will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student.
