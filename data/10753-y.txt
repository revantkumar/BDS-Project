Dave Keyston This is a bad idea. Americans should in all instances be given priority over aliens/immigrants/exchange students, etc.

When our country can get it's priorities straight FIRST, and eliminate the financial burden on the American taxpayer with other aliens and immigrants, then and only then, do I feel we can consider such a proposal as is being considered.
