Improving and Expanding STEM opportunity is going to be a wonderful decision by the government. All of these International students are working really hard and putting a major contribution in the tech field as well as the United States economy. Such a decision to extend the STEM training program for 24 months will enhance there chance to get better with the technologies and thus they can contribute even more in these fields. This valuable experience and practical training will be a great contribution to US research, technology and development, and very helpful for students before returning to their home countries as well.

However, a matter of concern is the added mentoring and training program; which will add extra administrative burden for all the companies which will work as a negative impact for hiring STEM students. Mainly for the small companies who don't have that much workforce to do the legal works.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment and believe that this decision to extend the STEM training program to 24 months will get accepted which will be helpful for these students and also for the US economy.
