I SUPPORT the proposal of OPT extension for international students with STEM degrees.

International students who are admitted to U.S. universities are the best students in their countries. They are brilliant and hard-working. Over the years, international graduates contributed tremendous growth to the USA economy. Their efficiency and enthusiasm made U.S. the most powerful country in the world. OPT extension is good for U.S. since more and more students can stay in U.S. and continue making contributions to U.S. economy.

Educational market is one of the most profitable markets in US economy. To finish their study in university, international students who get the support from their family will bring a lot of cash into U.S. market. If the OPT-extension is passed, more international students would prefer coming to U.S. universities instead of other countries like U.K, Singapore, Canada.

I have viewed many negative comments on OPT extension. Most of them mentioned about the competition between U.S. native students and international students. They claim that this rule will make it harder to find a job for U.S. citizens. This, however, is not the case. US IT companies have been long short of STEM employees. The job market is expanding rapidly in recent years. On the other hand, competition is not a bad thing. Pressure is a great motivator. If everybody in the society is so conservative to alien workers, this society will not last for long.

In all, I SUPPORT the OPT-extension.
