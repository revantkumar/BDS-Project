According to the Center for Immigration Studies the OPT Program denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. This program has turned into nothing more than a way to bring foreign people in to take jobs from tax paying Americans. It is outrageous that those in this program pay no taxes or social security! It is completely discriminatory toward American citizens! 

In March of 2014 the GAO issued a report that found this program was riddled with fraud, completely inefficient, and not adequately overseen. The report also indicated that this program was a threat to national security as the department does not know where thousands of the participants are and ICE cannot verify if they are even keeping their status legal. According to the FBI we already have so many foreign student spies that they have to way of keeping track of them. This program really needs to STOP! 

OPT pays companies to hire these foreigners instead of Americans. This program is contributing to the deterioration of the American middle class and the job opportunities to American college graduates. 

There are endless reasons to end this program. We need to employ American citizens. We do not need further influx of foreign students or workers.
