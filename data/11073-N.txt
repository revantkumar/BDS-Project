As a legal immigrant who became a Citizen, I find any attempt to extend the stay of 'foreign' students extremely objectionable. We, (citizens and legal permanent residents of the U.S.A.) must strive to improve public education for legal residents. 
The proposed change for F-1 students may temporarily enhance the profitability of some corporations but will have a negative long term impact. 
I respectfully request that the proposed change be denied and replaced with the original intent of the rule which restricted the time in the U.S.A. for foreign student graduates to thirty days.
