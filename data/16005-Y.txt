I believe this action would be beneficial for our country in the long run.

In economics we learned that the most important driver of long-term per-capita GDP growth is technology level. We need talented foreign people to work in the states, to help us develop new technologies so that we can always stay on top of the world. 

These phds attended the most prestige university in the world, equipped with world-leading ideas and what do you want us to do with them? Kick them out of our country and let them back to their hometown and help the economy there?

Come on, we don't need to be so generous.

Yes. We need them. We need them to be here. It's the principle of free market to stay only the most competitive. Stop worrying about American tech workers losing job. 

Any reform inevitably envolves pain. Let's be looking at the big picture. If it's good for us in the long run, let's sustain the short-term pain, and we are gonna benefit from it, for generations, and generations.
