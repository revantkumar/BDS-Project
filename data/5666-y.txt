Scott Chen I'm for the Cap-Gap relief. I'm a US citizen working in the high-tech industry in the Bay Area. Many people have been against foreign workers because that some companies abuse the system. However, in the companies (like google/facebook/etc) which are not abusing the system, foreign workers are actually creating a lot of value for the US, not stealing the jobs from Americans. It is those workers (and the liberal policies) that made US the home of the best tech companies. Without those people and a great policy to provide opportunities to highly skilled people, those high tech companies would have suffered and created less value for the US and less jobs for both foreigners and US citizens.
