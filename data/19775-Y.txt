I don't understand why some people disagree with this. In my opinion, everyone with clear mind should agree with this one. 
At first, we all know that Americans not good at STEM subjects compared to others. So there is a gap in the industry. The student who study STEM could make up this.
Second, some people said that foreign student will rob their job. This is crazy. Student from other countries has disadvantage in language. If American can do job as they did, those foreign student won't get job at all. The biggest reason those people will not get job is because their laziness.
Third, every is making their progress now. Japen, Russia, German and China. What can make more progress The answer is talents. If USA still want to make progress, he should try to keep their talents. Not push them away.
