I would strongly support the OPT STEM for the following reasons:
1) Foreign students come to study at US are most of much higher chance to get into high skill set required industries after graduation, like technology, medication, finance, etc. This means it is of much high chance that they are going to contribute to US economy and development if they choose to stay here to work. While the working visa is mostly from OPT STEM. Which also means, if OPT STEM is not going to continue, they would not be able to contribute as they could in the before, then firstly it is a loss of US since the demand of high educated employees in certain industries can not be satisfied any more, and this may further cause the much less development for the whole country; second, these high educated people can go to some other countries and then cause the US lose the competitive position in so many fields;

2) What the foreign students can bring to US is not only the ability to work and contribute as an employee, they would also work as the bridge between US and so many other counties. For international companies, international students can help to communicate and even bring some business relationships. Especially for emerging markets. On the other hand, since the international students need to pay much more for their tuition, schools especially colleges can then have more funding for research and then contribute the whole society with more academic support. 

3) Also, in terms of tax stuff, though international students may pay less tax as they can exempt the SSN for F1 period, but once they get into H1B, they would have to fully contribute as a US citizen in terms of tax pay. I was told by a consultant that a quantitative financial engineer would need to support a 5-people family with both parents file unemployment. While right now I would say 50% of the quant in financial industry are international immigrants, who came here for college/graduate schools, get a job, file H1B with OPT STEM,
