Glenda DeVaney This rule appears to be yet another scam by the tech companies to deprive American workers of jobs so the greedy companies can hire foreigners for a fraction of the cost to pay a decent wage to an American. This is shameful. How can they say there are no "qualified" tech workers in the U.S. when everyone knows they are plentiful, having been let go from their previous jobs which somehow they were qualified to have but, now, magically, are not. This needs an explanation. And, furthermore, our government needs to be purged of corrupt actions such as this against the citizens of our country.
