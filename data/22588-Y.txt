Desperately agree!

With the development of global economy, more and more talented students can be able to find opportunity to study and pay for the fee. There are so many smart and friendly students who can bring vitality to the States. As your know, since the States have the ability to attract them to study here, why can't allow them to stay here?

Not the burdensome,but the hope of future!They should have worked in their countries and made economical and intellective contributions to there. But they choose to come to the States, devoting themselves to the States building. I can't find any reasons for the States to refuse their continuous contributions.

So please making a considerate decision for this issue!
