I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I think a 12 months and 24 month extension is a good and appropriate time length for OPT program.

First of all, it will benefit not only the foreign employees but more crucial to many scientific/development companies. Base on my work experience as Technical Specialist at one of the top 20 software company, most large scientific company or development institutes need people employees to focus on a project lasting more than two years or more. And foreign employees on OPT account for a fairly large number of their employees. If OPT extension is shortened, it will not only results in the sudden loss of workforce, but also deeply harm the potential interest or future development of the company. 

Second of all, OPT extension will continue to be a strong attraction of foreign students, which could bring huge economic growth of the educational sectors of US economy. More importantly, it is crucial that we attract foreign students to US that we can keep the pioneer place in all research subjects in the future. Just like myself, before coming to US, I had multiple choices to pursue my degrees in other countries, such as Canada, UK, Australia, etc. One of the most important reasons I choose US is that US can provide the post-graduation curriculum training opportunities. It is no doubt that to keep at the pioneer place in the world in all research subjects, we will need large numbers of foreign excellent students. 

So I think the implementation of the new rule will be greatly beneficial to the long term development of US education and economy. And hope there are more people supporting this.
