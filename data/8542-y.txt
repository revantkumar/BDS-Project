Richerson Zimmerman High Tech companies hire STEM international students not only because they qualify, but also because they cannot find qualified local employees. The only goal of the company is to make money. For those people who were shouting "you're killing Americans", are you trying to kill all high tech companies by forcing all STEM international students going back home? I don't think that's gonna work, and this regulation sounds reasonable.
