If an individual comes to our great nation to educate themselves, why would we forcibly remove them from our country once they finish their education? This is stupid action on our part. We have just educated someone and now they would like to improve our nation by using their intellect and we do not allow them and force brain-drain to occur, why would we want that. I personally know someone who is earning their Master's degree and they are worried about graduating as their visa will soon thereafter expire. Why do we do this? They want to make our great nation even better and we say no they should go back to where they are from and make other nations better. 

We NEED to stop this policy of educating people and forcing them out; if they would like to stay we should allow them.
