I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. international students should have the right to take practical experience after they get education in U.S., otherwise the tuition and the time they take is wastes. After all we contribute a lot for U.S. universities, no matter in tuition or in culture.
2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.
3. U.S. technology development needs efforts from people in different countries and nationalities in the world.
4. International students will also contribute to tax for U.S. government.
5. A developed society should encourage competition instead of preventing it, thus the society and technology will sustainable develop.
