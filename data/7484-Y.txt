Bob Caponi US is strongest because we have the smartest people in the world. If you can not find a job, that is because of yourself, not others. As a US citizen, I really hate those US loser saying international student destroy their job opportunity. Come on, for those loser the only way to let them find a job is there is only him/her in US. I have hard work, I never thought anyone can steal my job and I enjoy the process to compete with others. I am US CITIZEN,but I am not a US LOSER.
