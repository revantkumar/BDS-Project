I firmly believe that extending F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees benefits America to a significant degree. After all, most of these students received their education in US with full fellowship, which means that the US government and universities have invested greatly on these students and of course we expect returns in accordance. If we keep these skilled students in the country, facts have proven that they can create way more value than what we have spent on them. If we drive them out of the country, it's purely a waste of taxpayers' money to pay for these students' education in the first place. Moreover, if we cannot keep them in the US, these highly educated and highly skilled talents will seek jobs in competitive countries, using their knowledge and skills learned in US. I don't see how this will do any good for America.
