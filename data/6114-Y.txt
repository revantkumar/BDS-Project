Justin Gudani As someone who has worked with many international students in college and in the workplace, I highly support any policy that would allow a student and/or recent graduate to extend their period in the United States to continue learning and gaining valuable experience. Working with international students provides brand new perspectives on subjects, taking on challenges by looking at them at different angles and surely can bring positive effects to other people's learning experiences. From my experience with working alongside international students, I would encourage them to extend their stay in the United States as much as they can as they will certainly learn and experience great things here while at the same time providing a positive educational and cultural effect on those living here.
