I read some of the opposed comments and cannot help but wondering since when does US closes its door to foreigners and refuse immigrants? Aren't this country built on diversity and immigrants? Since when does this country lose the confidence and afraid they will lose the competition to other country? 
This proposal is talking about educated and legal international student, not thieves, robbers nor murderers. They are EQUALLY recruited to companies(if I say, they do NOT even share the equal opportunity with natives since some companies do not sponsor H1B). They are NOT granted green card nor citizenship through longer OPT. They also pay taxes and most will eventually go back to their country. 
For the problem of unemployment and veteran employment, it is a totally a different topic. Government passing Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees, and passing policy to lift native employment and welfare are not conflict!
