You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. I think this is a great step by DHS which would definitely promote new inventions and innovations in field of science and technology. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow them to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. One of the most important reasons leading to US being the most powerful country is diversity. F-1 nonimmigrant students play a critical role in this diversity.
