I totally support this rule. And it will be better if OPT extension extends to 36 months.
First, as we know, there are so many international students studying STEM in USA now. Why do they choose USA? Mainly because USA is inclusive and comprehensive. International students can not only learn in USA but also have chances to work here for some time to gain working experience. But if there is no OPT extension for STEM students, international students may not want to study in USA. They may study in there own countries or choose other countries to study abroad. This will cause negative effects in travel industry, tuition income in USA. Second, STEM international students have contributed much for USA. If they do not have opportunities to work a relatively long time in USA any more, USA's technological progress will slower down.
