I strongly support the proposed rule for extending OPT program. This proposal will greatly help US companies to hire talents in order to remain competitive in the global economy. And it also makes it easier for students to get training experience.

The foreign students majored in STEM DO NOT take away jobs from US citizens as there are more jobs than the qualified US students with STEM degrees. The current unemployment rate is at historical low and in the economical sense, it can be considered to be full employment. In other words, people are unemployed mainly because they choose to be so for personal reasons. For those with a bachelor degree, there are more jobs there than the number of graduates. 

I believe the proposed rule will strengthen the US economy and thus creates jobs for US citizens rather than taken away jobs from them.
