I support this proposed rule.

This notion of this rule taking Jobs away from American citizens is false and a common misunderstanding. STEM jobs are always on demand and there are thousands of jobs waiting to be filled every year. Having highly trained and qualified students working in America after college, filling up the open positions paying taxes in USA is a better scenario than losing all those jobs to countries having an excessive talent pool. These jobs that STEM students end up taking are highly and more importantly equally paid regardless of if the employee is American or not. When the jobs are not filled, the companies look elsewhere and all the potential tax that the government is lost. 
It is important to rremember how this OPT is only for STEM students, those graduating from the best universities in the country. A nation cannot do wrong accomodating the best talents from all around the globe. 

My views on it come after being one of the many thousands benefitted by the program and with a clear understanding on the job market for STEM graduates.

"The new analysis of millions of job postings found there were 5.7 million openings in STEM fields in 2013, 4.4 million of which required at least a bachelor's degree and 2.3 million of which were entry-level jobs that call for less than two years of experience. "

-USA Today (Report on expanding STEM job market, Feb 2014)

Students working on OPT pay taxes like every other American, from the jobs they take which when left open often end up creating a job for a willing candidate in another country. Companies that hire STEM students would have to fill their openings. Rejecting this rule puts all the tech companies in a spot where they can find cheaper labor elsewhere and avoid all taxation in the US.
