International students spend lots of time and money studying in US. It is not an unreasonable request to let them get some industry experience here. This both benefits the student and our companies. Various news articles and research reports show that the demand-supply shortage of STEM is widening rapidly. If we really want to keep the STEM jobs, we should have more kids studying STEM. But unfortunately, not every kid is that into science and technology. I believe extending OPT isn't a bad thing, cuz having more STEM workers does boost our economy.
