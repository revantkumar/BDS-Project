I want to dispute those arguments of negative comments:

Companies should hire more US students instead of foreign students: 
It will take a long time to train new US students to fully compensate loss of foreign employees who lose the chance of opt extension

There is no shortage of US students in STEM: 
For my school, US students in STEM are really few. The government can easily provide data to prove that US STEM students are in shortage.

International Students take away jobs while paying no tax: 
That's definitely wrong! foreign students working on OPT DO PAY TAX! They indeed help local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge shortage of talented employee. Also, industries like house renting, food service will face great loss due to the loss of international students.
