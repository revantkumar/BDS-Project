* I oppose DHS's proposed rule that would expand the OPT program. Immigration policy must serve in the interests of American workers, not against it. Please, please, Federal government - don't do this to your own citizens!

* The existing OPT program, and expansion of it, provides corporations financial incentives for hiring foreign students in place of American citizens. Corporations can avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Also, the OPT extension could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree

* The OPT program is corporate welfare. A subsidy from Congress to corporations that helps them lower their labor costs by increasing the labor supply side of the equation. What ever happened to the free market and laws of supply-and-demand? If supply were really low then wages would increase to the point where supply would be satisified.

* The OPT program will hurt chances for older unemployed STEM workers to get back into the field. Over the past fifteen years there has been huge churn in the tech industry in the form of layoffs and hiring. Many older STEM workers that get caught in this cannot seem to get their foot back in the door - employers don't want to hire them because they don't have to! Dont' believe me? Then just take a look at the 38 year low 62.6% employment participation rate - this includes laid off tech workers that have never ever been able to get their foot back in the door because of the huge over-supply in the tech labor market. 

* It is a myth that not enough Americans are entering STEM fields. "According to the latest U.S. Census Bureau data, only 26% of science and engineering graduates are currently employed in a STEM occupation." [1] Why is this so? Americans are being pushed out in favor of foreign labor - which the government keeps supplying in terms of H-1B, L-1, OPT, ... and so on.
