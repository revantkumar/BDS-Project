I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

Reasons are as follows:

Firstly, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

Secondly, diversity is very important for the U.S.. Many elites in the U.S. are international students before, and they continuously contribute the society.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Since the international students who works in the US only occupy such positions that Americans cannot be qualified, competition does not exist between Americans and international students. If an international student have to do technic work and compete with Americans, he/she will prefer to go back to home country and get better jobs and higher social status.
