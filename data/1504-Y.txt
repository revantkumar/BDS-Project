United States of America needs F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees to grow strong. These students are highly skilled and they do work hard. Let the market resolve the problem. If most companies want to hire F-1 students and United States doesn't meet the needs, the market in every sector will be weaken. Companies cannot find talented worker. Technology and economy fade away. The dream of getting America great again will be vanished just like a bubble in the air. 

Chinese government send hundreds and thousands of students to study in America. Most of them are in STEM major. Now, Chinese government are short of talented workers just as America. If America doesn't open the door, I do think most Chinese workers won't hesitate to contribute their skills in Chinese market. A decade later, the silicon valley will be in China. The most advanced technologies will be in else where rather than in America. People will fleet from America. Even right now, the American infrastructure are so outdated and dilapidated. Chinese infrastructure is peerless now and advance American by 50 years. Ignoring the facts will only make it implausible to compete with any other country.

As a matter of fact, forcing F-1 student out of U.S.A is a way of avoiding competition. Therefore, using the government force to shovel the best talented scientists, technicians, engineers, and mathematician toward other countries. 

The companies need STEM F-1 students. The government and everyone should do their best to help and make this happen.
