Bonnie Holland I strongly SUPPORT the proposal! 

The international students in stem majors contributed a lot and are still contributing to our countrys economy. I want to explain this from a micro level. 

I have rent my house to international students for 8 years. Many of my neighbors are in a similar situation like me. My house is not in downtown, but the location is close to some universities. All my tenants are international students especially the stem students. Rent is the most important income for my whole family!!! Most of my tenants told me why they choose American is because they can get longer OPT. If we don't offer a longer opt as we did, we may lose a ton of international students in the future!!! That means a DISASTER for my family ever the whole community we live in!!! 

We need to let the students who learned knowledge from our universities stay in our country and let them keep making contributions to us!!!
