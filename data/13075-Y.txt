I strongly support the extension of OPT. Our country's education can make the best of the world mainly because we can get all the elites from all over the world. If this is gone, without OPT, you can see a lot of students will go to Europe or Asia. Do you want this to happen? The rise of China, and the less tuition of German and French schools. OPT is one of the main reasons why so many students come to this country to do STEM and contribute to our Economy. If those students are leaving this country now, so many important positions will be vacant and who's gonna do their jobs? Those people who work in McDonald's? Wake up America! Don't be idiotic! What makes our country great is not your hatred but the technology and economy. Don't be a fool! Let the students stay and keep contributing to our country and make this country better!
