I strong support the rule to extend OPT. U.S. economy will benefit from this rule, as more talented international students could be attracted to work in America and make contributions. 

Admittedly, some of U.S. Citizens who graduate from STEM can not find jobs. However, such phenomena is not result from international students. Each class consists of top students and normal students. Not every graduated student could find an appropriate job. This phenomena happens in ANY country. I am a graduate student in U.S. right now. In my department, a talented American student with multiple rewards successfully got a job from Apple, while a Chinese girl who is bad for programming can not find a job and hence go back to China. 

Thanks for your time. I sincerely hope this win-win proposal could be passed.
