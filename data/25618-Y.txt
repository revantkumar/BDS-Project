I support the proposal. The U.S government finally made some right decisions. Most of engineering and science students who go to grad school are international students. And if we asked them to go home immediately after they graduate,they will use their knowledge learned in our universities to contribute their own countries without giving any benefits to America. Extending OPT for nonimmigrant STEM students is definitely a good thing. We should keep them working here and let them contribute to our science and technology development as they have done for years.
