I strongly support this new rule.

Immigrants are the base and origin of United States. And this is the spirit of America and also the reason why USA has been the most competitive country over the past 2 centuries. Talents from Europe, Africa and Asia arrived in this continent in different ways and at different times, contributing to the prosperity of US with all their talents, labor, innovation and even lives. 

We should keep up this momentum, which guarantees US' continuous power. Embracing the immigrants does not mean accepting them without a standard. We look forward to attracting the most talented and skillful people from all over the world in a progressive and planned way. 

Now we came to the point: OPT international students, for whom we invested billions of tax money to educate and cultivate and who are equipped with the smartest brains, young, skillful, innovative and mostly harmless to other people. I can not think of a reason to refuse such talented people to contributing to US if they would like to.

On the other hand, if we hold a conservative attitude and want to stop any "outside" people to compete in the labor market with the excuse that they will take away the jobs from the US citizens, we are doom. True, less people will compete for the cake; however, the cake itself will shrink and become less tasty. In the end, every body loses its value, which is a loss-loss scenario.

As a university stuff, I have seen so many outstanding international students and would expect how much they will benefit the country if they are willing to stay. The last thing I want to see is that the government manually creates a gulf for such talents.
