Adding more workers on the OPT program is just a way of bringing in cheaper labor. The congress needs to look at the American people first before putting immigrants before them.

OPT program is an easy way for tech companies to recruit cheaper foreign workers at the expense of American workers and STEM students. Please stop this rule today! Stand up for American citizens instead, anything less is un-American.

The current situation in the high tech industry throughout the US is already overrun by foreign nationals flooding our job market with low capability, low pay candidates that keep qualified Americans from fairly completing for the jobs that are available

Government policies should be focused on protecting the American work force rather than facilitating its continued destruction.

I vote against this proposal.
