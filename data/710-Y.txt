I do think that the OPT is really good not only for the immigrants but also for US citizens and the government.

USA, as one of the most open country and the most colorful cultural holder, keeps standing on the top of many research field. The invention of computer, the moon-landing project, and also the introduction of Internet, are all made possible by the cooperate of US researchers as well as those non-US immigrants, those foreigners majored in STEM. Because of the possibilities of staying in the most developed country and work with the most intelligent researchers, they get the chance to do their best to contribute to the human society. The choice is mutual, the US government choose them, but they can also make the call. Keeping the most competitive people is the key to maintain a strong and top-notch country.

With other country proposed more and more appealing laws for attracting foreign researchers, it is critical for US government to propose more attractive laws to keep those researchers. Much of the revenue was spent on teaching and a large amount of this was spent on foreigners. If they just take the money to study for the top-level knowledge and just leave the state to devote to another country, that would be a huge lost of USA.

Foreign students not only bring the country money, but also their knowledge. So huge amount of foreign professors working in US universities, teaching and researching, have made invaluable contribution to the development of USA.

Finally, as a country that have so many different races and cultures, it is in the constitution that we should be more hospitality to others.

Thank you for your time in taking this into consideration.
