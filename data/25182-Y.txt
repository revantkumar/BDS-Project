Ofcause I will agree with this opt extension. Firstly, with longer opt time, American college or university can attract more international student study here and they are willing to pay the high tuition here, this can bring more money to America and at the same time this can improve the higher education resources to American people. Secondly, more and more smart people, no matter American or international people, can be involved into higher research in science or other field, this can improve and increase american research development speed and American can be the top country forever because we have more educated people. Thirdly, we can have those educated people work for us even longer after they get their degree here.
So I think extend the opt for international student have more benefits for us.
