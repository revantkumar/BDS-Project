I strongly support the proposed rule.

Having OPT after academic study is one of the major reasons why I came to US for my graduate study. Without a proper duration of OPT, I don't think I can get enough training for my career development, which would result in more Chinese students searching better training opportunities in other developed countries.

The proposed new time frame for OPT STEM extension is fair given the fact that usually recent graduates start to significantly improve their skills/performance and contribute to the company after the first year.
