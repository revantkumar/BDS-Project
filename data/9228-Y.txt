Lucas Chang I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. Firstly, STEM jobs are just a small part of job market, and they need very hard-working and smart people, there won't be enough American fit the requirement. Secondly, all the STEM students didn't take one cent from American social security system, they work hard and pay a lot of tax to support social security system, it's them who do the job most American don't want to do and pay a lot of tax after their hard work, I can't find any reason why they shouldn't have this treatment to just expand their OPT, in fact, I think to raise the H1B quota in related area is also necessary.
