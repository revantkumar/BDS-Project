I strongly support this rule and I believe this proposal is absolutely beneficial both for the U.S. and the students. Since it's just an extension for STEM nonimmigrant students, in the long run it will not pose problems for the U.S. citizens. Instead, it will provide a large amount of work force for the U.S., which is definitely critical to boost the U.S. economy. Besides, with more opportunity, more talented students will be attracted to the U.S., helping to improve all aspects including technology, culture and economy.
