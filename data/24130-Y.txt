The DHS, when referring to why it chose a 24 month extension, says that it believes that the proposed option would have higher benefits to students and employers and increase attractiveness for U.S. academic programs.. I completely agree, which is why it perplexes me that there is still no provision to deal with what happens after the extension expires. 

Will STEM workers have to leave? Thats a huge influx of highly technical & skilled workers out of the economy. Why would a company take the trouble to train someone only to have them leave in 3 years? It will result in a lot of churn. 

The H1-B, by virtue of being a lottery, provides no guarantees on this front. From a students point of view, the United States does not seem like a more attractive destination for higher studies than comparable universities in the UK, for example, where there are provisions for technical people to continue to live & work if they choose to do so after their education.
