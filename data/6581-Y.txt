Luke Yang I strongly support the proposed 24-month STEM OPT extension. I believe this increased period provide a vital opportunity for foreign students in STEM fields to find jobs, through which they would gain necessary training and experience that is critical for their future service to the flourish of our economy. We can't keep these brilliant talent away from our great nation.
