I strongly support the proposal! There are several reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. They usually study hard to get the degree and want to make make use of what they learned.
2. Diversity is very important for the US, many famous people are previously international students. For example, the Nobel prize holder this year from UNC is previously an international student from Turkey.
3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition could help the U.S to select more intelligent people and improve the average abilities of the US citizens.
