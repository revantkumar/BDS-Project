The whole STEM extension is completely pointless and should be scrapped. You should instead increase the bar for the H-1B visas, so they would be available and instead of allocating them yearly, move to a monthly quota. The H-1B visa quotas should also distinguish US Master's students from US Ph.D.'s (especially US tax payer funded Ph.D.'s). Why not rank the monthly H-1B applicants based on their offered total compensation (with some geographical scaling factors to account for differences in wages around the country) and choose the ones from the top. Let the market sort out who is in need by who is getting paid the most. This would allow talented students to quickly move to an H-1B and the ones who are not good enough could do a regular OPT and then either use their gained skillset to move to an H-1B or go back if the job market still doesn't want them badly enough.
