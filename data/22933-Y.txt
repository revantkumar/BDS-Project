I strongly support the STEM extension rule for F1 students.But i believe there is a need for reducing burden on students who work for a employer after the degree and also on employer to recruit a STEM graduate..In order to make it easy please change the verification of students using so many paper submissions from students,employers,and from clients. This will not create a nice environment to work in a Tech company. I urge DHS to Remove the declarations from employers and managers to extend OPT for a stem graduate hired by them..It is ok to take self declaration from a STEM graduate but will be a burden for employers. so please work on it. 
Thank you for extending OPT to 24 months.This will help USA to remain on 1st and best place in the world to work, to live and to be happy.
