Mona Williams Docket # 2015-26395

HOW CAN THIS COUNTRY, THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THESE UNITED STATES, PUT FOREIGN STUDENTS OVER AMERICAN STUDENTS? It is already too expensive to go to college, and then add the fact that a US citizen is passed over for a job due to this proposed rule is beyond comprehension!! Facts are listed below. I do not agree with any part of this proposed rule and would like to know how/who to contact on this matter. - 

The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT), which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.

A Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed two shocking takeaways about the OPT program that DHS proposes to expand:

OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. - 

Sam Rolley of Personal Liberty:

"not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes."
"a 2013 study from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors."
"Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields." - US CITIZENS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BEFORE ANY FOREIGNER - OUR/MY TAXES SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS MANNER. JUST SICK OF ALL THIS POLITICAL NONSENSE GOING ON.
