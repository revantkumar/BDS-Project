I STRONGLY SUPPORT the approval of this proposal and any opposition would be short-sighted and will do harm to American citizens and U.S. economy eventually.

1. United States is the strongest country in the world because it has been absorbing the most intelligent people in the world and provide them opportunities to contribute the United States. If the OPT extension proposal cannot be approved, many intelligent students have to go back to their country, less and less intelligent people can contribute the United States.

2. United States always attaches great importance to Competitive Spirit and Fair Competition, we should not stop intelligent foreign students participating in this long-standing and well-established competition. IT IS FAIR for foreign students, including STEM students participate in this competition, which will make US become stronger and stronger.

3. Actually, less US student like STEM, which is very hard. If STEM OPT extension cant be approved, less foreign student will come to US, less intelligent student can leave in US, and the whole intelligent level in technology competition will be lower and lower, it definitely destroy USs competitive spirit. 

4. Financial situation of University will be damaged. As we known, foreign students contribute a significant part of income in US university, if less foreign students come to US, it will destroy most of universities and colleges, and it will indirectly bring negative influence to the education environment of universities.
