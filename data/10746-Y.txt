From my point of view, the United States should equally treat all the overseas student. The United States symbolizes freedom, democracy and opportunity. That is why people who want to improve their education and prompt their career want to study in the United States. I strongly support the new OPT extension rule that students from all over the world could gain experience after graduation!
