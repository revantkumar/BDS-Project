This is America, a dreamland for all human-beings from various countries and backgrounds.

This is America, you can not just kick latecomers out when they step on this land with their hope, and do not forget that they have striven a lot.

This is America, you can not seclude it when the statue of liberty lifts her lamp beside the golden door!

So, here I strongly recommend, pass the new policy please.
