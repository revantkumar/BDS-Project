Qu Jin, UCLA I strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.

Over the years international scholars and students have made great contribution towards scientific researches and technology advancement. Such extension not only allows them to continue contributing to our economy and scientific fields, but also shows the world that the United States of America, as a country of immigration from the very start, continues to be accommodating for cultures and top talents from all over the world.

For those who are against this proposal, I hope you understand that it is those so-called "outsourcing" companies that are doing all the dirty deeds to damage the reputation of the international students and scholars. And I strongly agree that there should be regulations to restrict Visa selection process to weed out cheap labors instead of top talents. Opposing this proposal will not resolve the issue and will severely damage America's tech industry and economy infrastructure. 

Closing doors to international students does not help make America a better country. Instead, it will create an image of America as conservative and non-progressive. Our nation has benefitted greatly from international scholar/students (sorry to disappoint but Albert Einstein was not American to start with). Unlike a decade ago, many international talents do not depend on green card to live anymore. There are many other countries that want them. If we are not welcoming, they will not beg to stay.

I truly hope the United States of America continues to be progressive and accommodating as it has always been.
