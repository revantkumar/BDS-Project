The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.

I know that Disney and a company in CA had American workers that they were laying off and filling them with H1B foreigners-- so these people lost their job but had to train the new people before they left. How is this justifiable--??

Now, think about this. American colleges produce about 300,000 STEM graduates per year. Many of them already cannot find jobs in their fields. This new expanded OPT program Obama is pushing through will swamp the job market with cheap, no-tax foreign workers angling to become permanent.
