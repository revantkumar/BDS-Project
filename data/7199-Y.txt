Xian Zhang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. Employees from diverse backgrounds bring individual talents and experiences in suggesting ideas.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. The sustainable competition can generate more value and innovate ideas.
