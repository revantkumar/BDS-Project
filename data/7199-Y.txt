I do support this proposal. OPT for F-1 Non-immigrant Students is a brilliant innovation, it shall be improved and expanded. 
My opinion comes from: 
First, OPT gives F-1 students opportunities to make contributions to the United States. They are paying a significant amount of taxes and not taking as many benefits as U.S. citizens from the society. They make positive addition to the common wealth of the country.
Second, the fact is that U.S. has already benefited from OPT for F-1 students. U.S. universities have attracted much more foreign students than before because of OPT policy. Only the best of them can work in the U.S. And they are 
indispensable part of the most growing companies, such as Apple, Google and Facebook. The most of OPT students left and spread the ideology of the U.S. all over the world. European developed countries have left behind the U.S. recently, because they don't have OPT policy and they cannot attract talents.
Third, OPT does not grant foreign students advantages over U.S. citizens. OPT, in its nature, is only for a limited period of time. U.S. citizens are still more reliable working force to employers.
