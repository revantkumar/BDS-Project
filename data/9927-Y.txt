Yuan Zhao I strongly support this rule for the following three reasons:

1. With longer STEM ,international students will stimulate domestic demand during their stay in USA. Many international students come from well-educated and wealthy families . They are good citizens in the society and are the ones that help to increase domestic purchasing power.

2.International students deserve getting longer STEM extension to practice their skills learned from the colleges in the industries. For families who decide to send their precious ones to USA, they treat it as a long term investment. If they don't get the fair investment returns, less people will invest their resources in the USA education sectors. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance,so it is not fair to disallow or shorten the time students to practice their skills after graduation.

3. The immigrations and foreigners have been contributing tremendously in many fields to help Unites states to become the best and most powerful country in the world. More and more talented scholars, technical works, students are willing to invest their resources and time to come to United states to chase their dream and contribute their part to USA's economic growth ,because United states has been a immigration friendly country for a long time.
