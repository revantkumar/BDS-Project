I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees are important talents from worldwide. They are well-educated and can fill in the positions that require people with skills related to high technology.These people are a treasure to USA and they are important power to stimulate the improvement of this country.So it is very wise to keep them in US for a longer time. 

2. US Universities have spend a lot of money on these students and it is time for these students to pay back by working for the US. Most of the nonimmigrant students in STEM majors have assistantships, which means they get their tuition, insurance and living expenses covered by using the research funding of an average 40,000 dollars per year. It is a waste of resources if we just let these students go back their home countries immediately after obtaining their degrees.
