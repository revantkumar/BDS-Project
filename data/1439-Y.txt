I strongly encourage this rule because the following reasons:

First, these years a lot of international students majoring in STEM really contribute to America's economy. They have already created miracles in Silicon Valley. It's hard to imagine a silicon valley without Indians, Chinese and talented students from all over the world. Many technological companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple create amazing products improving everyday life for Americans.

Second, A number of stem graduates return to their home countries and make contributions
between America and other economical entity. This will enhance the economical exchange among those countries.

Third, America is the number one nation in the world in education and also in STEM fields. This rule will greatly make higher education more attractive because more students from other countries will come to US to pursue education and practical experience. What's the most important thing is that more students will spend more and contribute to US economy directly. After all, income from higher education covers a reasonable proportion of US GDP.

At last, this rule will give a good signal to the world that US is still open to the talented person and those guys can bring fresh stuff for American society.
