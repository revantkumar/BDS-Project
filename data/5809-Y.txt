James Johnson Strong support! There should be common ground as US should retain talented foreign students. Just imagine yourself as recruiter and you are doing a career fair or info session, two international students approach to you. You know both are competent for the job. Then you ask them, how long can you legally work in the U.S.? One says 12 months, the other says 3 years. Whom would you choose?
