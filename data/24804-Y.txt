I am a first year master student in Information Science and Technology. As a F-1 student, it's grateful to experience excellent education in the U.S. Meeting nice professors and schoolmates, attending interesting fairs, and working with smart teams make me feel plenty of possibilities. Besides, I luckily got a Teaching Assistant position when I came to school, which covers my tuition and enhanced my confidence on working in a foreign environment. Personally, life here gives me a lot of pleasure, encourages me to be a hard-working person and helps me to implement self-realization. That's why I want to pursuit a job opportunity in the U.S. At the same time, I believe there are many international students like me, trying their best to work, and contributing their effort and intelliegnce to this country. However, it's not easy for international students to get a job since with uncertian HB1 guarantee many companies don't want to spend time and money on international students. For now to get HB1 within 12 months is difficult, thus the OPT extension is super important for me, as well as other F-1 students. 
Thanks for providing us a chance to speak up. Hope this proposal will be approved soon!
