I strongly support the OPT extension not only for international students' but also for US citizens' benefit.

I read some of the opposing comments online.
The most common reason is that international students take American's jobs. It is common sense that company will only pick those excellent students with specific academic background. The majority of international students have either Master or phD degrees obtained in US. They've lived in US for at least 3 years without any income. Also, students's families all come to US on travel. It's a contribution to US economy! 
IF OPT STEM is no longer valid, those excellent students will go back and contribute to their home countries. It will definitely affect US economy.
