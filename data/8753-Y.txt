As a international student, I strongly approve this policy of extending OPT for STEM student.

Frankly, I really feel heart-broken to see so many disapprove comments. I came across the earth to learn something hard and want to stay to make a contribution to the US. Is that a bad behavior from the native peoples' point of view? I feel like it's discrimination that international students do not deserve a job especially a good job in the US, from those negative voice.

Maybe it still needs many years to make the US a real world of freedom and equality.
