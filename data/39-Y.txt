STEM-related job positions require specific skills with higher bar than other positions, and they are usually offered by industrial corporations like IT companies from CA and fundamental research institutes like national labs. These corporations and institutes prefer STEM foreign students from India, China and East Europe, mainly because they have solid skills that match the jobs and are hard-working, but NOT because they require lower salary. Actually, the annual base salary of a software engineer with just 1~2 year experience has been around $130,000 in CA (just refer to Glassdoor.com), much higher than the average salary of US. OPT extension policy provides a larger talent pool for these corporations and institutes to choose the most appropriate employees, so that they keep competitive and innovative, and also tax contribution. It is absolutely bad news for them, if their scientists, engineers, technicians, and mathematicians are expelled by the stop of OPT extension, and join their competitors in China and Europe. It doesnt make any sense.
