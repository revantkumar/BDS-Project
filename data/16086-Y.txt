I fully support this.

OPT and its extension is an inseparable part of the STEM education that US universities provide. This new policy will help those students to gain not only knowledge but also working experience from their education. While OPT (withouth extension) is a 12-month long program, a lot of entry level positions in the STEM areas have training programs that last from 6 to 18 months, some even longer. In my view an extension is absolutely necessary. An OPT without extension, or as some of the other comments suggested, no OPT at all, clearly deteriorates the quality of higher education in the US. 

The contributions STEM nonimmigrant students make to the economy are very important. Giving them better opportunities to work in the US is not, as some of the other comments ridiculously claimed, taking jobs from US citizens, but its very opposite. I believe the US government will be wise enough to decide whether to embrace hundreds of thousands of well-educated, talented and hard-working people, or push them away. 

This country used to treat people differently based on where they or their ancestors came from. Then someone said "I have a dream". Well, we all do.
