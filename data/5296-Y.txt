US educational institutes have international acclamation for the rich content of subject matter. They have constantly featured among the top institutes of the world. Students all over the world seek to gain knowledge and earn a degree from these universities to further their academic goals and secure a good future. 

Being an international student, I could tell the difference in the mode of study when I joined a reputed US university for my graduate studies. It has been a huge exposure into the job environment since I started working for my current employer on F1-OPT after I graduated. This job has given me practical opportunity to implement the skills I acquired during my school days in the US graduate school. 

STEM OPT is an extremely helpful platform that buttresses growth opportunities for international students like me who look forward to acclimatize with the work environment in the US by means of implementing the knowledge acquired in the US grad school. This new STEM OPT proposal is a positive step forward that has ingredients to give a substantial amount of time to support the courses covered in grad school. This will truly help to 'complete' the education that an international student seeks from the US University he/she goes to.
