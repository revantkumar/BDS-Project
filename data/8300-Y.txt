I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons. The proposal could offer student with opportunities to practice their knowledge and make great contribution to the technology development of US. With some competition, companies could find more talented people. Also it may encourage more people to get into science and technology filed. To prevent the abuse of OPT or H1B working VISA, the government should be focusing on those fake companies.
