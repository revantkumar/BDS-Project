I strongly support expanding OPT STEM policy

The international students in STEM fields will not have a bad impact for local workers. First, the STEM industry is in lack of human resource, so that a foreign student in those fields does not "occupy" a position for local workers. Second, the STEM field is highly paid and this is way beyond the minimum wage. For example, a fresh graduate software engineer who works in Google gets paid more than $50 per hour, which by no means keeps the minimum wage from growing.

Therefore, I strongly support this new policy for a better USA
