I am disgusted beyond words that my own government is more interesting in helping foreigners find jobs that helping a natural born U.S. citizen myself, I have been struggling to find work for a decade even though I have a STEM degree from Cornell University. Companies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse H1-B and OPT to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas. The H1-B and OPT programs should be eliminated, and the U.S. government should focus on programs that match Americans to employers and make "older" workers (35+) a better investment to the company by creating incentives. This kind of program is what the American middle-class desperately needs before it disappears altogether.
