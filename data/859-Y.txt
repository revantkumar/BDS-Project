I'm an international student graduating in the coming few months. Now I am actively seeking a job in US. I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada and Hong Kong. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. 

Companies in US are actively seeking young, talented students. It's hard for them to do so if students who do not get H1B visa have to depart from US. Companies would like to hire employees who could work for them for a long time. If international students are insecure about the work authorization, students may choose to leave US and build their careers somewhere else. It would be a great loss for US companies as well.

For both students and companies, I believe it's beneficial to have this new STEM extension.
