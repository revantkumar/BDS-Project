This is the most Un-American, Treasonous policy I can imagine! It blatantly spits in the face of Every Legal American Citizen! 

No One has a "right" to come into this country. It is a Privilege that should be Rare and Deserved by Only those who can Better America!

As Disney is the most recent company to be known to exploit this policy, I will mention that I used to work at Disney Studios in Burbank, CA.
I attended Disneyland in July 1955, and dozens of times since.

Because of their disgusting treatment of their employees lately, I am now boycotting them, along with Every other business that treats it's employees...and all Americans...in this deplorable manner.

Shame on them all. Shame on anyone who allows this to continue.
