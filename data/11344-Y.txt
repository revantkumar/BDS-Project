It would go against the fundamentals of American spirits, should the extension of Overseas students be shortened. In my humble opinion, as locally trained talents, they deserve the equal right to apply and work in the US upon their choices like their peers with permanent citizenship. The exchange of talents and diversified working environment could benefit not only the States or companies such as Apple or Google to just name a few, but the innovation and technology industry across the world. Computer science, characteristic and with language of its own kind, was bounderless since its birth. Its openness should be expanded, not the other way around. With all due respect, pray that the authorities think twice before stopping the stem extention program. Many thanks.
