I strongly support this rule due to the following reason:

It is the American Spirit, which gives everyone equal chance, attracting the talent students from all over the world. However, limited number of H1B working visa every year already seriously limits the working chance of foreign students. Most of the foreign students have to leave the USA eventually even with the help of OPT extension. Taken into account the same or even more amount of time they spend in school compared with American students, they deserve more time, which could be given by the OPT extension, to practice their skills and to give their contribution to the American industry before going back to home country simply due to the limited number of working visa.
