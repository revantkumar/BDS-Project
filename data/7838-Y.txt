Vidya Rayachoti This Rule would improve USA economy and try to remember that only legal non immigrants pay tax. 
It would give USA more CEOs, engineers, scientists, programmers, doctors, nurses, etc. create more jobs and also provide more intellectuals who are reliable and efficient employees too. 

These OPT students could create great apps which make lives easier for all. USA need this rule so badly......
