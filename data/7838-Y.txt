WHO IS TAKING MORE JOBS FROM US CITIZEN?

US relies on high technology industry. US needs more talented workers from all over the world to support its international position. Non-citizens need MUCH more restrictions to work in US. Non-citizen workers can get H1B visa ONLY IF EMPLOYER CAN PROOF NO US CITIZEN IS QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION!

OPT is temporary. Only qualified, exceptionally talented aliens can remain working here. They are extremely NEEDED in US!
