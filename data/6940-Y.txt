The OPT must be expanded due to the following reasons.
1. The emigrants built up the American history.If the OPT extention were cancelledit would reduce the diversity of colleges and have negative influence on bringing foreign students to study in American.
2. It will be bad to American economy.It will cause the large IT companysuch as GoogleFacebookto lose their excellent foreign workers.These workers would go back to their own country and serve in the local companies with their outstanding skillswhich will cause the American IT companies to lose global markets
Based on the reasons aboveI strongly support this proposal.
