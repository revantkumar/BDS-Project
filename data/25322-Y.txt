I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer science master student from China and now I worked at BitSight Tech. as a full time engineer. I wasn't plan to get a foreign master degree in the beginning because my parents don't have much money, and they tried to use all they got to support me do this, which is not what I want. However, after I got to know the OPT extension rule, I realized that I could try my best in university, and then use what I've learnt to pay them back. That's the major reason that convince me came here. I don't think there would this many talented international students here if you don't have the OPT extension rule.

Also, I spent 6 months as a co-op intern in BitSight before I joint them, and that's when I really got to know the big picture of the entire project. It would be sad that I have to leave the team when I can finally do something matters much due to the policy.

As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.

Hope more people support this good rule!
