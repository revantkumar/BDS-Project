Before getting an internship opportunity I wasn't quite sure how can I help U.S. economy; but now after joining an engineering firm for a couple of months, I was able to bring two great projects for our company so far (one from overseas).

I strongly disagree with the idea that international students will take American jobs; I believe they create more jobs for this country.
