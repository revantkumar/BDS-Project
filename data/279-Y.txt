I strongly support the proposal.

It is almost ridiculous worrying that foreign students would simple grab jobs opportunities that should have belonged to US citizens. I graduated from one US top ranked university and as far as I know, there is fewer US students than one can ever imagine are determined to work in CS or related fields. These positions are simply not as attractive as other areas and it would be benefiting to give these relatively more technical jobs to graduated college students abroad. 
There is no doubt that OPT needs more serious regulations to prevent some appliers from "cheating" by applying through multiple businesses to improve their fighting chances. However an absolute "NO" to the proposal will be a disaster to all of us. Currently there are thousands of foreigners on OPT are waiting for their chances to play the lottery, once this proposal is rejected they will be kicked out leaving behind such a mess that you or me could not handle. 
I agree that the current provision "accredited universities" is too vague and needs to be specified. Cheaters need to be punished and put into blacklist. 24 months extension is a resonable amount of time and if this sounds too much for some others, I suggest increase the number of seats to give a larger possibility for the draw. 
And for those who argue "citizenships", most of us who work on OPT are as decent as you are. We take what we earned legally, nothing more. It is shameful that you forgot you and your family are immigrants once yourself.
