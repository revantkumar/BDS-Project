Alick Wong I do support this regulation. Many of the comments here are really unreasonable. The US high tech companies hire STEM students because they qualify, not because they are paid less by the employers than the citizens are. I have many HR friends working in the high tech companies, and I'm sure that all employees on the same level are guaranteed to have roughly the same offer package.
