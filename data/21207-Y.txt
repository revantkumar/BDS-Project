I strongly SUPPORT the proposal! I'm a STEM student in U.S. and it was because of the benefit of the OPT extension that I decided study in US rather than Canada or Europe. This proposal can keep US competitive in the education market and attracting top students to US, and in turn contribute to the blooming of the US economy. This proposal is not only for the benefit of the foreign students, but every American!
