Support this act

I support for this act because I believe America is a country with equal working opportunity regardless of the nationality. I am also an international student who is not from stem program. But I see my stem friends are suffering too much when looking for jobs even though they have better qualifications than many other candidates only because the their working authorizations. Think about the money and time they paid in order to get a better job here, it is unfair for them to be rejected by employer who only wants local people. 

I hope all people could truly get their equality in employment in U.S.
