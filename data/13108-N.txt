We need officials in office who are representing the American people who actually put them in office not foreigners or illegal
immigrants who our current administration seems to be protecting and doing anything and everything to empower them with
money, jobs, homes, or whatever they need. America needs and should be great again, but only when stupid people stop
electing greedy, retarded, blind politicians who don't realize they are killing America with their greed and STUPIDITY. Politicians
kill more americans in a day then a terrorist does in a year. If I could I'd FIRE every congressman, senator, vice president, and president;
then replace them with random homeless people on the street who would do the job for 10% of the salary and do a 200% better job
than the people who are doing it now.
