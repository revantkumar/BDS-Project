Jason Rodriguez I fully support the stem extension. Without Opt, and with H1b being unavailable to American educated international students, American industry will risk a death spiral because skilled foreign students will be working for other foreign companies, which are more likely to compete with US companies in the global market. If we cannot keep the talents, we will loss the competition.
