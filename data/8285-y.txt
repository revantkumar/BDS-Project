Yi Zhong, North Carolina State University This is surely a good news for both companies experiencing lack of qualified employees, and foreign students who have an american dream. I hope the American dream is still alive - people can earn their right to stay and work here not because if they were born here or not, but if they are willing to work hard and work smart. The economy is globalized more than ever before, and so should human resources. 
Studies have shown that by accepting more international students from STEM, there are much more job opportunities created by them than taken by them. If anyone think they can get a better job by repelling those people without an American citizenship, please think again.
