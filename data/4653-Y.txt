Some people think that some of us lose job because of the OPT for foreigners. However, the STEM students is actually creating more job opportunities for us Americans. They are NOT WORKERS who earn a living by offering cheap request. The students develop the Hi-Tech which our country is based on. America win its worldwide reputation of freedom and warm welcome of all talents. The rude shouting of some guys for this policy only reflect their ignorance on the future of our country. Instead, they only focus on how many of the tax can be spent now and only on their own need other than all citizens.
