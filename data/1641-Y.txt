Strongly support the new rule.

I am a foreign student, a tax payer, and an economy contributor. 1 week ago, I just spent $1.5K on purchasing Disney World experience. Hundreds of thousands of students like me, have been, or will be spending tons of $$ and help eventually benefit your country.

I graduated from The George Washington University in 2014. In 2012, my school admitted over 700 Chinese students and raised the tuition, because my school is planning to build a new building. And they made it. Now all students, local or foreign, are benefited from this.

My landlord owns a house, she makes money by renting each room to international students, because the house is really close to George Mason University.

My point is, without this OPT program, we would not come to the US if we didn't have chance to work.
