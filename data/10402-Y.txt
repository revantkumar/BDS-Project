I strongly support the proposal of having the OPT STEM extention period to be 24 or 36 months. I think it is important from the perspective that while on a project if the initial OPT period finishes, and that if H1 file does not get picked up or H1 visa gets rejected due to some reasons, it will cost the company time and money to find an equally good replacement. Since OPT candidates are hired on huge numbers, if the extention period is made to be 24 or 36 months, it would be a great advantage for the companies as well as employees on OPT to continue with work.
