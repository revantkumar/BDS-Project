BAD IDEA. unless you think it's a good idea to create huge incentives for businesses--which are ALWAYS looking for ways to cut costs and maximize profits--to hire foreign workers instead of americans because they won't have to pay their 7% share of taxes to our government. more unemployment for americans...higher tax burden for americans...corporate fat cats getting fatter in the bargain...yeah, that's the best idea i've heard in ages. sign me the **** up.
