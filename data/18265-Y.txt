I Oppose. 

Please think of the African American family who pooled their resources to send their prodigy child to college for a STEM degree. Picture this proud graduate at the top of her class. Now picture her as she hears about the foreign students at the bottom of the class getting OPT opportunities to work at corporations where she had applied and never heard back.

This is the reality in my family.
