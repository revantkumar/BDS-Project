Xi Wang Hello Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau,

I am writing this comment to support to improve and expand OPT for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees.

I, as one of them previously, had been through the tough experience for H-1B working visa. Hence, I am willing to share my experience and opinions to approve why OPT needs to improve and expand.

First and foremost, F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM are the most important resource for the blooming development of IT, Internet, Medicare and other advanced technology. As an Engineer who has been working for 3 years after graduate school, I would like to say, without any doubt, most of my colleagues used to be a part of the huge F-1 Nonimmigrant students league. 

Secondly, They devote their efforts and intelligence to the company, meanwhile, they also contribute to the US economy. From other perspective, each one of them bring in different culture, different work style, and different dreams which precisely reflects the spirit of the American Dream.

Last but not the least, F-1 Nonimmigrant students actually are branding America, American companies and American products to every corner in the world. I do not truly believe commercial advertisement will help the other side of the world to know about American products. Even though a few seconds might worth millions of dollars, it is unable to impress a person who grew up in a totally different culture. But, F-1 nonimmigrant students, they have the unbreakable bond with their original culture. The information delivered by them will definitely be more convincing. They are just the butterflies whose wings' movement cause the unforeseen storm in the other end of the earth.

Thank you very much.

I sincerely hope the government can consider this as one of the priorities.

Best
Xi
