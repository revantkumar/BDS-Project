This regulation should not be approved as many American STEM students cannot find employment related to their fields of study at this time. This appears to be simply a program to allow foreign students to be hired (and for a longer period of time) at cheaper wages than American counterparts who may be just or more qualified. Additionally since they do not have to pay FICA or Medicare taxes, this hurts all Americans who would be benefiting from qualified American workers paying these taxes.
