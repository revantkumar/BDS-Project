I support the OPT extension for the following reasons:
1. It can prompt American students to work harder to improve their competitiveness.
2. It would not reduce American citizens' possibility to find a job because American citizens and permanent residents are always first priority.
3. It is not a good idea that those STEM students make contribution to their own country instead of the US after receiving high-quality US education.
