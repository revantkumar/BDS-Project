1. Those who EARNED higher degrees in STEM in the US, have been contributing to the country after being educated here with the policy of OPT extension. Sending those with knowledge out of this country right after the education time period is an action with no vision... you got the money of tuition from those students, and that's it. And this is going to be a loss in the long turn - because you are "giving away" people who are well educated and are proven to have been contributing in creating more value for the society as a whole. 

2. The number of Americans who are out of work(listed by someone above) is showing a problem I agree- however, this is not a problem CAUSED by educated foreigners...they are here to add values. And I believe the quality of workers is one of the keys to a healthy and wealthy county.

All in all, those who SPENT triple (maybe even more) amount of money in the US for a master or higher degree ( who have been proven as a large group of contributors to this society) at least deserve the "equal" (not asking for triple) opportunity in the job market.
