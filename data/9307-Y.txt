Josh Reich I live in Sillicon Valley. If the OPT STEM extension is revoked, the economy here will suffer. Industry in SV depends on those international STEM graduates, and in fact, a large portion of companies are founded by former international STEM students. They in turn creates more jobs for Americans, and keep US being the most attractive place for the best and brightest from all over the world. We must not lose them.
