Jackie Chang I STRONGLY support the proposed rule:

This rule ensured thousands of F-1 Nonimmigrant students to continue contributing to our country after their high eduction in U.S. 

Also they pay taxes. They will guarantee more jobs in U.S. because they will pay the rent, grocery. They will buy vehicle and pay the gas. They do not have the right the same as U.S. citizens, but they contribute to our economy and technology even more than average citizens.
