Strongly support this rule to be approved,as every one could see, this rule could bring a huge economy benefit and job market benefit to US.

1. US is a free and fair country, which everyone should share the same right to work or live here. The approve of this rule could help this spirit goes on.

2. STEM student bring a huge economy benefit to US. The reason why so many international student study here is because OPT and OPT-ext could give them chance to learn and learn by work here.More and more international student could driven a huge education market here and bring even more good job for US people. Not only the education market, but also the commerce market. The growth of students will driven the needs of local market. Please check Malden, MA economy growth situation. This small town is open to a huge number of international student, the economy is driven a lot by the welcome of international student. 
Also, STEM student could pay a lot of tax while they are working here. Most of STEM student's annually income is higher or equal with middle class of US family. Who pay a lot of tax. I saw some comment said that STEM student will pay less tax, however, overall the tax they paid is even more because the higher base income. 

3. STEM student bring a lot contribution to US economy by working hard. And driven the technical industry moving fast. This rule can help US attract more outstanding people working for US. Where the benefit to United State or to US people is so huge that can not measurable.

Strong support this rule being approved.
