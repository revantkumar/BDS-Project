First, the U.S should let the international student in STEM fields stay longer in the country as this can continuously boost the technological and economic development of the US. U.S has a long history of immigration friendly policy which makes the country strong and thriving. The dominating status of the U.S in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely due to the contribution made by millions of scientific and technological talents from all over the world.

Second, the diversity of the society is very important. Diversity could help U.S absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices.

Third, intense competition for jobs in the U.S is beneficial in a long run. The competition can push the majority of citizens to enhance and strengthen their skills. The citizens already have a natural edge when competing with foreigners because they do not need sponsorship and they have language advantage. We should probably blame our elementary education in STEM instead of immigrants if our citizens still find it hard to land a job in the STEM field with all these advantages.
