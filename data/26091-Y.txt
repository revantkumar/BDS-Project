I strongly support this proposal, not only for my own interest, but also for the interest of this country.

With the extension, foreign students are encouraged to bring their talent and education to the benefit of this country, instead of bringing them back and construct their own. Many of these students have college degrees, and they are excellent students that work hard in their academic career. They are exceptional talent that can benefit the development of this country, especially in the field of science and technology. 

At the end of the day, the proportion of foreign student employees is still only a small fraction of the entire workable American population. 

Concerning the issue of immigration and the worries from the American people who are afraid that their jobs are taken by foreigners, first of all, as mentioned above, that amount will be very small, and the worries are mostly excessive. Second of all, companies can raise the standards for offering jobs, and thus the best of the best will be remained in this country. 

Although, from a global stand point, more and more talents are coming from other countries to the U.S. is not as beneficial for their home countries, yet for the interest of this country, if it let those talents go back, its not a win for America. Extension does not guarantee employment, and only the very excellent foreign talents will remain. This makes the country stronger, more diverse, and maintains its leadership position.
