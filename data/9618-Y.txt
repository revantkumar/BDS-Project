I don't support this policy.
First a lot of students illegally make their opt valid even when they are unemployed through some school fake project and some so call consulting company like CCC and ICC.
Second this students consume lots of occupation in USA when make others difficult to find jobs, next it also make the H1B getting more and more difficult to get.
As a matter of fact, a policy that let those who deserve jobs but not getting one is not a go0d policy, I believe 12 months of OPT is already enough.
