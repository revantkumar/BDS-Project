I positively agree with the OPT extension.
I think the OPT extension is a double-win for America and international students.
Those guys who refused this is reasonable, since they just saw a very small view.
The main reason that this rule is refused is many job positions are taken by international students. But this is not true.
If someone is able to apply for the extension, that means the person has already got job. So the extension doesn't affect the number of available job positions much.
Also, the extension is kind of a promise that an international student have a high chance to get a job, which in turn will get more international students to study in America. This is good for both academy and economy. If you search the payment that international students made in America in 5 years, you will see more than 30 billion dollars!!! If this is a bad thing for America, I don't know what is good for America then. For academy it is more obvious, different education will bring more brainstorm.
For the reasons above, I believe the OPT extension is a perfect double win for both America and international students.
