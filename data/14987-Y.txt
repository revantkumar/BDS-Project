Currently a lot of high tech companies hire foreigners with STEM degree to work. So directly abolishing the STEM policies will highly impact our IT industry, which may impose negative impacts on our economy. 

It is true that foreigners with OPT STEM visa may compete with our citizens in the short run. However, the major employers of those OPT visa holders are in high tech industry. The reason They hire those foreigners is only because of number of US citizens in high tech job market cannot fulfill their demands. Otherwise, no employers will be happy to pay same amount of salaries with extra visa commitments to those foreign workers. So This indicates that those foreigners do not occupy positions of our citizens in a large scale.

Moreover, OPT STEM visa is considered to be non-immigration visa. So a large part of those foreigners will finally back to their home countries instead of staying in US. When OPT STEM extension collaborate with small H1B quota, and long green card waiting time, the policies help US citizens to stop immigration waives while keep foreigners serving for us for a long time.

In conclusion, STEM policies help high our tech industry grow, and also collaborate with H1B and green card policies to stop immigration waives while keep the foreigners working for us.

Considering the benefits for US citizens I stated above. I strongly agree to preserve STEM extension policies and even increase the extension period.
