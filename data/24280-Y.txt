There is no doubt that OPT extension is beneficial for both America and common American people. Students from all over the world are all elite in other countries. They will promote the development of science and technology, invent new and cool staff. I knew a genius guy who didn't get h1b and has to leave his company. I think this is a huge loss for company and American society. I truly advocate the OPT extension!
