The 24-month opt extension would be great for US economy. Here's the reason. There are huge labor gap in many technical industries. There are not enough qualified US citizen to do the jobs. Companies still need to train the new grads at first several months. If the trained new employee leave after one year because of they don't have opt extension to work legally in US, it will waste the money of US companies, and of course will hurt US economy if many this kind of thing happen. 
So we should support this policy for US economy.
