With the condition of our economy the way it has been in our country for the past seven years, WHY, WHY, WHY are we not offering special training to OUR CITIZENS first and foremost?

We have allowed too many foreigners into our country and it has put our economy in the toilet, and will continue to do so until we focus on helping our own citizens get employment first. Immigration limits, decided decades ago, were designed to allow for assimilation into our country so that the economy would not be overtaxed and would continue to flourish. With 13 - 20 million illegals in our country, clearly we are in this horrible economic condition because we have lost control. To prevent another crash like 1929, we had better get a handle on our borders! WE DO NOT NEED TO ENCOURAGE IMMIGRANTS TO COME HERE!

We have millions of people on Welfare, many of whom are illegal and sucking our social benefits DRY. Americans are sick and tired of helping the world with our tax dollars. We cannot afford to continue to do that. Look at the national debt!!! ENOUGH!!

We should be helping lift up OUR CITIZENS FIRST into the job market to improve our economy! A strong economy in America will then allow us to help others.
