I really want to express my SUPPORT to the extension. Globalization is an universal trend that cannot be reversed.Think about the situation when Walmart extended its production and market to the rest of the world.US workers use to hate this idea because in this way the entrepreneur can save costs by hiring cheaper labor force and cheaper sources from all around the world. In the several years, however, did this idea ruin the Americans life? Of course not. On the contrary, it is globalization that makes several good as well as cheap products from all over the world accessible to the American daily life.

I concede that globalization is a double-edged sword, so why don't we make the best use of it instead of fettering ourselves? For instance, within the 24 months of training, employers could test carefully about how capable a STEM student can be in his job and make the best choice. 12 months, otherwise, is a little bit too short for a program in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

Even though job hunting pressure do exist, I believe the government and enterprises would prefer well educated employees with extraordinary capabilities rather than average somebody. With their industry and intelligence, STEM students will help the society as a whole solve existing problems including employment and many others. What we need to do is give them a chance as well as give ourselves a chance.
