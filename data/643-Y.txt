Support. 

I'm a former recruiter and now employer. I'm newly US citizen, work and live in US now.

Obviously, OPT students, especially Chinese, are the most polite, talented, hard-working and respectful group I've ever seen. I think many of your guys have the same feeling with me.

Many of you guys complaining those OPT students took the career opportunities away from you. But think, they are better than you, and why should a company hire you instead of them?

You are afraid, because you do not work/study hard enough, or you are not so good at the very beginning.

You have the right to complain, but remember, it's just because you are randomly born in US, that's all. 

No one can choose born country, but every one has the right to love another.

They deserve a better chance to show abilities, to make US and us better.
