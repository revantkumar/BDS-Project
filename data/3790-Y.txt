I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them have opportunity to making contributions to the U.S. Diversity is very important for the U.S, currently there are a large number of international employees working in u.s. company. This rule would benefit both the foreign students and also the US society.
