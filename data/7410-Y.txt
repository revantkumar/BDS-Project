I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S industries and economy. There are many international talents and they bring great benefits to the US. They are only STEM students and many US students do not want to choose STEM as major, and they will stay only for three years, so they will not bring pressure for US employment rate.

The tuition fees of US universities are really expensive compared UK, Australia, Singapore and many other countries, the reason for many students choosing US is because they want to take advantages of the OPT to practice and gain valuable experience. Canceling the extension will make US universities less competitive with those countries, harm to US economy and reputations.

Looking back to the US history, diversity is a really important factor that contribute the country to prosperous developed country. We should never forget the history and hold the advantages forever to develop the US.
