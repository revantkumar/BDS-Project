Xu Gao I am strongly support the new proposed rule about the opt-extension. The new OPT-extension policy will not only benefit the international student, but also lots of companies and most importantly the USA as a whole country will benefit from it. At first, OPT policy make lots of American companies can hire lots of correct employee they need and want, which is obviously very good for the companies and enterprise. The graduated F1-OPT student got the knowledge and skill from the university. The companies like to hire them because they can provide what the company need. In the free market, the companies know what is best for their development, while hiring the graduated student with OPT is definitely in line with the companies benefit. But if without the OPT-extension, most likely, the student can only worked one year for the company, because the limited H1B number each year. The result would be that companies will lose the most productive employees just after one-year training, learning and adaption in the companies. 

Since there is a big number of student with OPT working for American companies now, cancelling the OPT-extension will have a very big hurt to the companies' development. Therefore, I would strongly recommend the proposed opt-extension rule.
