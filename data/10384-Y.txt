Yingjie Li I would like to thank the DHA proposing this rule to STEM students. I think the new rule benefits the high tech companies, especially the small ones. Even though the international students the hired could not get the H1B, they are allowed to work for the companies legally about 2.5 years. This is a huge bonus both for the employees and employers. For one thing, the employees are encouraged to hire talented students and don't need to worry about they could leave very soon. For the other thing, the employees have more opportunities to work and spend money in America. It doesn't make sense as someone said the new rule will damage the locals' chances in job market because the present situation is, the employers prefer to hire natives. It's easy to understand that they have to spend extra money and provide H1B to the natives. Under the same conditions, the natives absolutely already have had huge advantage comparing to the international students. If the locals, graduating from the same school, would not complete the internationals in the present job market, I think the problems are happened to the education system rather than the new rule.
