For time being this is a great decision by DHS. I completely support this. I request DHS to consider increasing H1B cap too. Because employers after training the students for 3 years doesn't like to leave them. So this would make the employers reluctant to hire a STEM student. Although this would make the situation better than what is now for students. This rule along with increasing H1b cap would make more sense and would be fair.
