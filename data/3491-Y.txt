As a STEM graduate student, I am supporting the extension. With two years extension, I could better apply the knowledge I learned from the US college to the US industries. It is a both-win strategy. It could acttract plenty of smart international students to work in the US and make benifits the US economy. It also follows the spirit of America as an immigration country, this extension will make the best yonger generation have more chance to work in the US and the US will benifit from these talents.
