Vandhana Ramamoorthy As a former graduate student currently working in the U.S under H1b Visa, I strongly support the 24 months OPT program for students studying in STEM programs. The program clearly gives a chance to explore the real world opportunities and applications of the various concepts and ideas learned through text books. This application oriented education will immensely fortify the knowledge gained, help the students acclimate to the corporate culture and eventually benefit the employers in tapping the vast potential of the new grads. The provision "Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields" will help avoid any detrimental effect to the U.S workers. This clause will help treat the new grads and their U.S peers as equals in terms of responsibilities, compensation and benefits. I strongly suggest to implement this rule by december 2015 and helping the new grads with protecting their futures.The proposed changes will eventually help to increase the University revenue, city, state and ultimately the country's economy. The 24 month OPT program will attract the best minds from all over the world to study in the highly competitive universities. It will immensely help the current research and technology scenario and reinforce the country's stand as a technology leader.
