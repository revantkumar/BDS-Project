I strongly agree to extend the OPT for students in the STEM program because they have made our life better and our nation stronger. Each year there are tons of students coming to the U.S. for education. Some of these students choose to study in the STEM program and become the best and brightest in fields such as computer science, math, chemistry etc.Take a look at Google,Apple, Microsoft, where a large amount of its employees are international and come from the STEM program. They are the reason that we can search in our finger tips, browsing videos from our favorite YouTubers online, get thinner and lighter iPhone/iPad/Mac year after year. They are the reason that our life is so convenient, the reason that companies can function efficiently, and our nation stronger. 

I strongly agree to extend the OPT for students in the STEM program because U.S. is a land of dream and freedom. The nation is founded under the constitution that enforces openness and fairness, we should support fair competitions if there are any, because that is how U.S. get to its leading position in the world.
