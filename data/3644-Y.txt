Zach Wang I believe the STEM OPT extension is a win-win policy for both American citizen and foreign students. Foreign student bring huge amount of economic benefit, not only for the higher education system in America, but also countless other industry like hight tech. I think the American citizen will benefit from the economic boost and prosperity created by foreign student in long term.
