I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It is absolutely shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. The United States of America itself is built up by immigration from all over the world ever since the beginning, different ethnic group with different education background from different countries is making their own contribution to the great development of the States. If international students are excluded from the future of the United States, the United States might lose its great attraction for talents all over the world, US might lose potential power for further development. Let's say, Albert Einstein is one of those international guys with academic background who comes to US to make a live.

2. There might be some competition between international students and local workers, but everyone would agree that competition is not a bad thing. Without these competitors, employers are not able to pick up the best guy for the position, companies will lose internal motivation of development. As a result, without better economic outputs, obviously the people of US are not able to enjoy a better life, at work or after retirement.

I strong SUPPORT the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
