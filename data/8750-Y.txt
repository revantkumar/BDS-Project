I strongly agree with the OPT extension for international students, especially STEM students.
OPT is a very attractive program for international students. Every year, majority of students come USA from all over the world. One reason is the high quality education USA can provide. Moreover, the other reason is these students can get opportunities to be employed by US companies during the OPT period. But the 12 months OPT is far from long enough for international students. Because most of the STEM projects need at least 3 years to complete. The employers surely hope their employee can make a such long time promise before offer them jobs. But right now, the H1B quota is limited. Lots of people cannot get their H1B in the first lottery. That means they have to leave America after their 12 months OPT exhausts. Considering this, the employers may not be happy to offer jobs for international students. A 24 months extension can help these students. Also, it benefits employers. They have more possible to hire high quality employees and contribute to American economy and prosperity eventually. 

Right now, more and more markets rise from various country around the world. If American companies hope to explore these oversea markets, they have better employ the people from those countries, who are more familiar the place where they grow up, and they can help their American employers make correct and effective policy. Therefore, international students are a great bridge between American companies and these oversea markets.

OPT extension won't induce unqualified labors be retained in America for a long time. Because the extension application needs a positive review from companies or institutes. Unqualified labors are not possible get a positive review from employers.

Last but not least, international students won't rob jobs of native people. OPT extension requires the employers must be e-verified, which means these employers commit their job hiring is equality to every person fro
