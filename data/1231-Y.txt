Jiawei Chen I Strongly Support the OPT-EXTENSION for following reasons:

1. U.S. Tech companies need STEM international students to contribute their work to tech industry after graduating from college. We know that there are so many startup companies, which are built up every year, they need employees with specialty to improve their companies. 
2. And for Most STEM projects, the completion period lasts for more than 1 one year. If we cancel the OPT Extension, many companies who hire the students in short OPT may have to recruit new employees to replace OPT students, which do harm these projects.
3. If we cancel the Extension, it will make the universities in America less attractive than now. We know that many intelligent foreign students choose America rather than U.K, because America has the advantages in giving them the opportunity to practice their skills after graduating.
4. If we cancel the Extension, many international students will come back their countries after graduating and contribute to their countries' development, which is not beneficial for America.
5. I strongly believe international students do not take up native American students' positions in IT companies. Employer only hires the right person, no matter you are a American or foreigner. As a result, it makes no difference whether we allow the OPT extension or not when a American student satisfies the companies' requirement.
