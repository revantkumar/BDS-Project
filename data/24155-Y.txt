I strongly support the proposal.

1. This allows US to attract talented people from all around the world. Without this, many of the future geniuses will choose to attend schools in Europe. 
As seen from the past, US benefits a lot from its diversity and many experts in computer science, communications, material sciences, etc are actually from other countries and are able to stay in US because of OPT and STEM extension.

2. A big portion of professors in universities came to US with F1 visas. They helped to maintain the high research and education quality. 

3. The competition from international students helps to increase the work efficiency and boosts the US economy, which will create more jobs opportunities.
