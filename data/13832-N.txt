Expanding benefits for foreign students at a time when unemployment of American workers is at record levels and American college graduates are facing a shortage of jobs and career opportunities is lunacy. The first priority of government should always be toward meeting the needs of citizens first and expanding this program is contradictory to that principle. I OPPOSE this proposed rule.
