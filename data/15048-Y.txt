Too many students and adults are training for jobs in which labor surpluses exist and demand is low, while high-demand jobs, particularly those in STEM fields, go unfilled. The hardest jobs to fill were skilled positions, including well-compensated blue collar jobs like machinists, operators, and technicians, as well as engineering technologists and sciences.
THEREFORE, it is beneficial to extend the OPT extension and the people who in STEM OPT can fill the position and make contribution to US economy.
