I support the OPT extension: 

1. US is a great country with great people who have or should have confidence in competing with people all over the world. Using the law to protect the weakness of mind is a bad bad idea for the sake of this country. If US born Americans in STEM are really competitive and know what is going on, the OPT and its extension has nothing negative on them but stimulating their growth. 

2. A lot of Americans think they can do STEM jobs, which I agree. But the problem is there are not enough options for STEM employers when they need STEM students. Using my department (Civil & Environmental Engineering) as an example, professors desperately want Americans to join their research group. Unfortunately, not many Americans submit the application (we are not talking about the qualifications of these applications). So, now the situation becomes, if you don't hire international students, you don't hire. So, it is the choice of US born Americans. You create the problem to STEM employers. If you lose jobs or can't find a job, it is not problem of international students, it might be owing to your choice of your education at the beginning. Note, the situation I am referring may not represent the entire STEM departments, but it is true in my area. 

3. The majority of F-1 students who come to US are exceptionally talented and brave. That is why they can be here. They pay rent, they pay taxes and they support the development of the country, if they are hired through OPT. They are not sucking the blood of the country. Objecting OPT is equivalent to refusing the chance of speeding economic and social development of United States.
