I support STEM degree opt extension because of follow reasons.

1. It makes no sense to abandon STEM opt extension because there currently have thousands of hundreds of F-1 students holding their opt and work for U.S companies. It will be a huge impact to IT industry and scientific research institutes that will suddenly lose huge amount of work force.

2. I strongly disagree with those whom said this action will increase U.S job market competition. There are not many U.S. citizens choose to study in IT, math, science or other fields related to STEM, and most of U.S. citizens who have STEM degree would be hired prior to students who hold F-1 visa. Therefore, in terms of competition, I believe it's more like an unfair competition to foreign students. In addition, I believe those foreign students who have the ability find a job in this UNFAIR competition will be the most excellent ones and could create huge value to society. 

3. Many people holds opposite views pointed out that:'' OPT removed a lot of many from SSN or other benefit, and tax payers pay extra to feed those foreigners." When I interned in U.S. I paid for SSN and medicare using my paycheck, and I believe a lot of F-1 students did same as me. However, as F-1 student, I don't have the right to enjoy those benefits. Like everyone else on this land, we pay for tax, we are not fed by anyone else. 

4. Compare to huge amount of illegal immigrants in U.S. F-1 students contribute more and have lower criminal rate. I believe laws to this group of people should be loosen instead of tighten.
