I strongly SUPPORT the proposal based on the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S., so that their knowledge and potential can be maximized to the largest degree.

2. Diversity is pretty important for the U.S., from the historical, cultural, societal and population perspective.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition by itself can select the most excellent talents and promote the diversity to the most extent.
