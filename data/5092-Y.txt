There is NO reason to bring foreign students in to train, then allow them to work here. We already have enough of our jobs given away to illegals. These students will be allowed to work here "temporarily" which like everything else will turn into permanent. There is no policing of people who have over stayed their visas & this I am sure will be the same. They will be paid lees than our citizens so big business will win again. No more foreign workers!
