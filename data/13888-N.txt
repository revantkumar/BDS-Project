I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. The new rule would extend the program's length from 12 months to 36 months for these STEM students. The program incentivizes U.S. companies to hire foreign students and recent graduates because they do not have to pay the prevailing wage or their share of the 7.65% payroll taxes for the foreign worker, costing Social Security an estimated $1 billion dollars a year. Costing Social Security $1 billion dollars. All the tax money is from lawful U.S. citizens and a small number of foreign employees. I don't think we want to the government to spent our tax money that way and our next generation's employment are not secured.
