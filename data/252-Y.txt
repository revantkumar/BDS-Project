I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. The proposal won't hurt American workers to find a job. It is unfair to say that a top student find a job with his outstanding talent violate Americans right because he is more qualified and he could make more contribution to the company and even the country. High-tech companies always hire a lot foreign workers not because they are low-cost labor but they are more qualified for the job. While America is country of freedom, why students cannot have the same right to find a job and companies should hire their employees by nationality?
