Krista Fariel I strongly support the new rule on opt. Ending of opt extension will cause more than 30000 foreign students to leave the US. All these students have been well-educated and trained and they are probably going to go to some other country and make that country better. It will be a big loss for the US. 
Some people are arguing that these foreigners take a lot of job opportunities. But these STEM students are not the reason of the unemployment of Americans. To protect the benefit of American citizens, most job postings require citizenship or permanent residence. To hire a foreign students, the company needs to pay more money for the visa application than Americans. The foreign employees needs to pay exactly same payroll tax, social security and medicare. These STEM students are hired due to the high demand in their field. They are not competing with American candidate for Disney and SCE. In contrast, they are contributing to the US economy and creating more jobs. 
I think the new rule on opt extension will benefit greatly for the US.
