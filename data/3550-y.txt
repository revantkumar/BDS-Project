Victor Goma I strong support the OPT extension to allow foreign workers contribute their skills to build the democratic America. 
Foreign workers not only generate a huge tax revenue for the USA, but also bring in asset and investment that makes up a key portion of new jobs. 
The USA as a diversified country generates its economic and political dominance because of its openness to foreign talents. These talents are not only highly educated but also bring in innovative ideas that transforms the market. Without them, the USA is not the one that was founded more than 100 years ago. By banning the extension, the USA will lose the top spot for competitive talents. Talents will go to other developed markets where they are more welcomed to build their dreams. They go there to revive a new economic force that would transform the whole society. 
The longer the OPT allows the student to practice in the USA, the more benefits they could generate for the society. The whole welfare of the society is also depending on the foreign students.
