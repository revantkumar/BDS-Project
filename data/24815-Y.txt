The STEM OPT extension helps the foreigners with higher education background and top-level talents better serve US industry, academia and economy. Without OPT extension, many talents just leave this country immediately and serve other countries with the knowledge obtained from USA. Actually we see US already loses thousands of top-level foreign scientists and engineers in the last few decades, which is sad.These people get higher education in US and their knowledge and talents cannot be replaced by other people. They contribute a lot to US industry, education and economy. 

I believe the extension from 17 to 24 months will definitely strengthen the power of US science and technology and boost US economy in the long run. I don't know why some people do not like OPT extension. This rule is for the interest of this country. I think US must always welcome the high-level STEM graduates, providing them better opportunities like OPT extension. This is a world of competition, if US do not like them, they will work for others.
