I strongly Support the OPT-extension.

1. Without any doubt, OPT-extension will help America attracts many talented people with high skill for certain field, which will obviously boot the economy of America. There are lots of examples of how talented employee can contribute to development of high tech company. Just think what makes Apple Inc reach today's achievement. It's pretty clear.
Some of these fields listed in OPT act are the pillar industry of America. America must not lose in these fields to maintain its leading position. Nothing is important than this. If a country is weak, then its people's living condition will be worse no doubt!

2. What I want to say here is to verify why OPT-extension won't affects American employment.

First, at least as I see, there aren't many American like to learn or are learning those majors listed in OPT-extension. In my university of my major, there are only 0.3% students are American. This means this act won't affect most of the American's employment.
Second, for those very few American who's major are in those fields in OPT-extension, as far as I observed, if they are qualified for the job position, they always get hired.

So in sum, passing this act won't affect American's employment. Not doing this will cause a disaster to American's economy and leading position.
