Xixi Wang I strongly support this: 

The OPT extension will help improve American's domestic consumption, leading the increase of GDP. With more foreign students coming to the states, the consumption demand will be aggregated, which creates and offers more job positions at the same time. 

The OPT extension will not decrease American citizens & residents' employment rate. This extension is only applicable to STEM students - with the rapid increasing of job requirements in these areas, OPT extension will attract more talented people to work in the states and to ease US's employment pressure. 

With the OPT extension, US universities will benefit from cultural diversity, cultural tolerance and global viewpoint. Which will benefit US's research in STEM areas as well.
