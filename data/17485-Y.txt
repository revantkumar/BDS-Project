I extremely support this proposed rule. First, US government spends their time and money to train those international students. If the government just let them leave after graduation, why does the government train them? The government just want to train students for other countries? Second, it will be beneficial for US citizens. Competition is important for people to improve themselves. This competition will inspire the people of United States to become stronger. Finally, I strongly support this rule.
