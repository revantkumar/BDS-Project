I really SUPPORT this opt-extension. We all know jobs related to STEM are much more technical than any other vocations. The eligible workers should be educated and trained in a not short period. If they don't have enough time to find and adjust to work, there will appear a severely lack of employees in many fields of American companies, which definitely do harm to the economy of America. And I am afraid that it will reduce the speed of economic development. That's why I think this extension is very important to America.
