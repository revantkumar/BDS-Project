I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

It is clear by the actions Obama and his administration have taken over the past several years that he has no hesitation in placing the interests of some of big business over the interests of American citizens. I'm not surprised, but am very disappointed, that people like Johnston will sell the future of their grandchildren and other younger family relatives by going along with this. Apparently there are no administration employees who are willing to say enough is enough, and bring this to the public's attention. Certainly it would cost them a job, and perhaps that is the major consideration, seeing as how the economy is not sufficiently strong to give them hope they could find something comparable. I protest this action, and support your effforts to bring this to the public's attention and stop it.
