Anonymous Alligator I am highly worried about the shortage of U.S workers in the STEM fields which might lead to these jobs eventually moving out to other countries. The best solution would be opening up our borders to these international students who are highly intelligent and motivated to retain the edge US enjoys currently. These students pay high tuition in our universities, stay here spend money, build companies, create jobs and therefore stimulate the U.S economy. Sending them away after a great education , will deprive the US of much needed talent and create competition to our own companies down the line. I strongly support the legislation the expand the OPT program.
