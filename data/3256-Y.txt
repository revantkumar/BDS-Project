xin zhang It would be a great honor for me to provide my suggestion here about the extension for the OPT for F-1 student. 
Study here in American provides me a lots of chance, opportunities to enlarge my knowledge, my horizon to the whole world. I enjoy the life here as well as the great time with all my friend. Upon to the end of me academic period, I really appreciated if we could still got enough time at USA to achieve more.

We have got enough knowledge and we want to use that to do something for this society, for the people around us. Having a longer extension would really improve the aspect of that.
