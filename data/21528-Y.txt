I strongly support the proposal of OPT extension!

I see so many international students study hard, gaining 
Knowledge as much as possible from university here. They are excellent of learning and can do a 
great job in the future. Nearly all of them have the ability to find a decent job which are closely related
to tech, finance, etc. They make great contributions to the US economy. OPT extension help to
improve the opportunity for those people working in the US and continuing to making 
contributions to the US. OPT extension is a wise decision for the government to make!
