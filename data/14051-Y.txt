I am opposed to importing cheap labor, which only benefits profiteers. We have plenty of skilled labor in the US. 
This comes under the heading of a " sell out".
Filling up the US lowers the standard of living of the general populace (look at China), loads up the natural resources, increases poverty, and benefits small percentage of the US.
