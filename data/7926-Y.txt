This is a very exciting news for both international student and employers. It not only supports students who is willing to earn educational working experience after their graduation but also provide employers opportunities to look for best fit candidate. My company hired me as an internship of model risk analyst. Due to the role requires both strong finance and math background, no one applied it prior to me. My background and research in the graduate school is what they exactly look for this position. They hired me right away when the interview is finished.After only two months internship, I was promoted to the full time employee. In the U.S,I believe the company might suffer a hard time looking for employee with STEM background prior to DHS offers OPT. Like my experience would tell me, if they could not find the right candidate fit in the position in time, there could be severe financial impact to the business. 

In addition, the company would not pay you less because of you are on OPT status. Since most of the company would continue applying H1B visa for the international employee, the H1b visa regulation requires employee's salary higher than the average of the position in the area. Moreover, the OPT is a transitioning period for those international students who have sponsor sponsoring their H1b visa. 24 months would give ample time to get the H1b visa due to the quota of H1b has not been changed yet.
