I truly hope that everyone can support OPT extension policy; this is an absolutely wise rule to help all graduates and undergraduates in America work and find a proper job in future. Now no one can ensure a new graduate can adopt into real industrial field quickly and correctly as they usually do not have so much experience as professional engineers. Please be affirmative in this OPT extension rule to give those students more time to be an active factor of the great country!
