Why import workers for jobs that our students are training for in college.........the cost of an H1B Visa is very high. First you have to have an immigration lawyer who charges by the person, then there is the fee paid to the government which doubled after 9/11, and then housing, medical, etc. to be paid for by the company that brings them to the U.S.A.

If would be cheaper in the long run to hire candidates from Universities or specialty graduate schools and would not displace American workers.
