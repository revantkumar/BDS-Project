I strongly agree the OPT extension. I finished my CS master in Duke and this is my first year working in Google. I came to US not Austrilia or UK because there is an opportunity of diving into the real industry to gain experience. And as we all know, people with only one year experience is still being considered as new and inexperienced. Working here for three year could highly improve my competence, so when going back to my own country, I could do better than those who doesn't have experience working abroad.
