Indraneel Patil I support decision for extending the STEM OPT for 24 months. Big tech giants would from suffer talent crunch if present rule is discarded. Having 24 months extension will give ample opportunities for them to file H1B if they think the candidates are good.
The present quota for H1B of 65K is not able to suffice the talent crunch. This new rule will be beneficial for industry also for student to get exposure.
