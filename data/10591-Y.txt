This rule is absolutely worth supported. Let foreigners with STEM degrees working in US benefits a lot, not only to foreigner themselves but also to Americans. US is currently lack of talented people in science field; with this rule, more talented STEM students could stay in US and help develop the economy. Also, US is known for the spirit that everyone should have equal opportunities. So to my point,like Americans, foreign students deserve their chances to work and continue study after they graduate, as long as they are able to bring benefits to US companies with their knowledges and creativities. Without approving this rule, students who are planning study in US may stop their path. Education will go down because of losing a whole bunch of money from foreign students, as we all know, their tuition fees are double or even triple the fee of local students'.
