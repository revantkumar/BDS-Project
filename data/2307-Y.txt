I strongly support this new rule for the F-1 STEM students. After the F-1 students spend time in the US to learn advance knowledge and technologies, they have the chance to work here to apply what they learn in school in the industries. All these students are smart and they will greatly help the US development, both technologies and economics (the most important one). However, I don't think 12 months is enough. 24-month extension is a great improvement. With longer time, they can contribute more on this country development. And also Consider what they have brought to the US - taxes, monies spent on accommodation, dining, travel, insurances, etc. And all these aspects will bring many jobs to various industries.
