I support the extension of OPT. The work force from foreign students is very valuable to the US and keeps US's competitiveness in both technology and economy. An what about those who are using OPT extension now? Putting abrupt termination on their working authority will pose immediate hardship for those students and their employers, as well as US economy. The greatness of our nation is based on the diversity of its population.
