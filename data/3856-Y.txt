Qian Wang I strongly support this rule because I cannot imagine without the OPT extensions for STEM students, will the most talented STEM students in the world still choose the United States as their priority place for further study.
When we consider about going abroad for our further study, the chances for us to gain practical experience after graduation is a very important one in our criteria. Thus, if the United States revoke its policy in OPT extensions for STEM students, it will lose its long-term competitive advantages over many other universities in the world, and thus lose its attraction to millions of STEM student that has brought numerous money to US education industry each year! Besides, these most talented STEM students is the important reason for US economy, technology and research.
1) If the OPT extension policy is revoked, why we not going to France for study since a lot of excellent universities there even do not charge us for tuition. 
2) Why we not going to the UK for study since lots of world-class universities there have shorter programs for both undergraduates (3 years), masters (1 year) and PhDs, which means we can pay less tuition, less living expense, invest less time to gain a degree and begin making money earlier? 
3) Or why we not going to Canada, Australia or New Zealand for study? Because they have less expensive tuition and much much more friendly policies to us!
