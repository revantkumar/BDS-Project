I think it's a good way to make USA stay the leadership of STEM, since more STEM foreign students will consider to stay, so that we can have more options of nonimmigrant students. Currently, some other countries (such as China), are promising more salaries for those students, so that we already lost those future employees that we already spent millions of dollars to educate! And now they go to another country to work, using our best technology! And USA is doing all this effort to make other countries better. I think we'd better let them stay for a while, and later, just let the best stay, and others leave.
