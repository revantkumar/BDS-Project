Kun Hu I am one member of our foreign students and I support this act.
First of all, I cherish this opportunity to study in US since it costs me and my family a lot, time, money and energy, to seize this chance. I do not want to restrict my studies merely in academy but oriented to life, society and even the world because study itself appears in many situations, places or environments. Besides, expanding training opportunities is a win-win game. I get what I want, broader knowledge volume, different culture, new ideas and etc. You let me consume with my money here to accelerate the economy and contribute to native organizations with my own time and efforts. With this act, you and I can both receive more in a longer time period. Additionally, this act can attract more foreign promising talents in the future, which is also what is expected. Moreover and for those objectors, I don't know what is bad in this act and leads to such ideas of yours. I admit there exists a small number of foreign students who are black sheep, troubles or exceptions. This is a "risk" to introduce people from other countries, and nobody knows what they will do so people permitting and introducing them has some responsibility. Though, the key part is to make them responsible for themselves. If they do not want to be the good, they are what they are no matter how this act is changed, and then agreed or disagreed.
