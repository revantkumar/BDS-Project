The president's actions have and will forever injure those American citizens who are qualified and seeking to work in those industries where jobs are being given to foreigners first. Where will these citizens work after being denied gainful employment in the industry(s) for which they have sacrificed and been trained? The president is pandering to these foreign workers and his program is just more evidence of his globalist, anti-American plan to destroy the sovereignty of this nation while lining the pockets of his high-tech donors.
