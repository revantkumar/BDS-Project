International students brings tens of billions dollars to US every year!!! 
US Department of Commercence has listed the education of the international students as the number 6 Service Export business.
Most of the international students will come back to their home countryThose stayed in US will have more chance to establish new companies and creat more job opportunities for US people. According to statistics, the possibility of the graduate of the international students to start new business is 4 times of that of the local students. It is totally wrong for those who thinks that international students take away the job opportunities of the local people.
