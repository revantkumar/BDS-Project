Charlotte Yip I strongly support the OPT extension proposal for the following reasons:

1, Employing international students will not cause a decrease in the job opportunities for normal u.s. citizens. The companies which are hiring international students are the high tech companies like amazon and google. The only kind of international students they would like to hire are the students majoring computer science and mathematics, which common u.s. students do not tend to be good at. For the popular area among domestic students, like business and finance, companies in such areas don't hire international students at all. 

2, Those international students hired in high tech companies comtribute a lot to the government tax income, which will be used to benefit the society.
