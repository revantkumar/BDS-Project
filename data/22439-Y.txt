I really hope this rule passes!
Before I came to the US, I've heard about the OPT and OPT-extension programs. I think they contribute a lot to my final decision to pursue my master's here rather than in Europe. I think it's great benefits of the STEM programs here. If I'm aware OPT extension will be in danger and possible get invalidated, I would not have come here to spend tens of thousands of dollars for the master's program. If you know you can't turn what you've learned here into valuable work experiences, you will possibly doubt the value of participating in the STEM programs here.
If OPT-extension is invalidated, lots of companies will have trouble hiring international students. And they will lose lots of skilled international workers. I can't imagine the history going backwards that way.
I'm frank that if the rule is invalidated, I will lose my job which I've been pretty good at and go back to China. I will feel so disappointed about this land which claims it's fair and democratic. If I go back with just limited work experience, I don't know if it will still be worthwhile to come here. The promise the United governments gave all the international students was not kept!
I really appreciate everyone's efforts working towards this. And I hope my voice could be heard. Please don't let all the international talents down! Please don't let all the companies down!
