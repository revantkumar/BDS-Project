Mengwei Liu I strongly support the initiative of expending training opportunities for F-1 students based on the following reasons:

1. The Optional Practical Training program is one of the selling point for universities/colleges in the U.S. to attract high quality foreign students from all over the world. If foreign students make a comparison between the U.S. and Europe regarding the high education systems, students are more willing to go to the U.S. because not only can they learn knowledge, but also they have much more opportunities to apply them in real life. I would imagine that stopping this program will jeopardize the reputation of the universities in the U.S., discourage students from choosing them.

2. Foreign students (especially STEM students) have been (and will continue to be) a great help in the development of U.S.'s economy and industry. From the U.S. government's perspective, pushing them away, forcing them to go back to their home country is a short-sighted, unreasonable action. Look at the high tech companies in Silicon Valley, although being at the bottom level of the pyramid, foreign students/graduates are contributing in a dispensable way in these companies. High-end technology development will get stuck or even regress if these students/graduates are not allowed to work in the U.S..

3. Different from immigration, OPT is a temporary working permit that won't cause too much trouble to the domestic labor market. Admit it or not, there are hundreds of thousands of job opportunities that cannot find U.S. citizens to fit in the positions. It is very easy to control the number of foreign employees by shrinking the number of H-1B petitions, so why not provide more opportunities to foreign students?

4. Becoming a threat to U.S., China has hundreds of thousand students studying in U.S.. Is it really a wise decision to push these well-educated young people back to China so that they can contribute in the development of China?
