So if you look back now, take gun shooting for example, how many tragedies are made by non citizens and how many are made by Americans?
You mentioned OPT took jobs away, but do you know how many jobs OPT workers creates? 3~4 jobs are created when America has one more STEM employee. The reason US is giving STEM students more opportunities is that they create much more than they take. Give some credit to your government, please.
