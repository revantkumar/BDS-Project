This is definitely a good move. It will be good for both US and F1 student. The F1 student come to US and get higher education. Their knowledge and skills can be used by US. There are lots of professors, researchers from all over the world. They came to US and contribute to US. US should give F1 student the opportunity to work here longer and contribute more US.
