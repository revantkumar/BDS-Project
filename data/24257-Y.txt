I DO SUPPORT 24-month OPT extension!!!

These international students will create a lot of job opportunities for local resident. For example, I owned a restaurant very close to a university. There are a lot of students had lunch and dinner at here. Almost 80% of them are international students, from India and other countries. They make a great contribution to American economic growth.

Some people said that these international students stole their job opportunity! How ridiculous they are! If the native student and the international student applied the same position and their performance in the interview are identical, I think the company will definitely hire the native student. If they hire the international student, they need to apply the working visa for the international student. It will cost a lot of money and waste a lot of time. I don't think the company will make a wrong decision in this situation. The only reason they hire an international student is that they can't find a proper native candidate for that position! So, how could you guys said that they stole your job?! 

Anyway, I STRONGLY AGREE with 24-month OPT extension!!!
