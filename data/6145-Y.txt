Robert Ashby With 94 million Americans out of the labor force (the highest in 37 years) and wages stagnant since the 90s proposing to bring in MORE foreign labor to take jobs and suppress wages to make corporate donors happy is a slap in the face to American workers and MUST be stopped.

For every two students that graduate with advanced degrees in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).. Only one is hired. For those with Computer Science degrees 32% said IT jobs are unavailable. While 53% found better jobs outside IT . This indicates the supply of graduates is substantially larger for those with STEM related degrees than the demand in the industry. While pushing for more foreign born tech visas (H-1B) HP, CISCO, Microsoft, American Express, TMobile, Procter & Gamble, etc recently slashed tens of thousands of American Workers. The census bureau reports "74% that have a BS in STEM are NOT employed in STEM occupations." 

This does not stop the Chamber of Commerce, Silicon Valley and their mouth pieces from pushing for increased immigration for tech workers! This affects our children and our grandchildren who cannot find jobs in these industries because we are importing foreign workers to take these jobs. Wages have remained flat since the 90s which is exactly what Silicon Valley and the Chamber of Commerce want. The flow of guest workers amount to 1/3 to 1/2 of all NEW IT job holders in America!
