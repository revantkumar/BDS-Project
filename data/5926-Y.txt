Kranthi Addula I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.

I Love contributing to Innovation and American Economy. I love the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.

The growth of the technology sector in America is attributed to the Technology Innovators living in this amazing country. Highly skilled minds from across the globe come to America to get the best of education from the world's top universities. Students come here to learn and then apply that knowledge to build some of the most innovative products. If these students are not given the opportunity to fully blossom and spread their fragrance, its going to be in some way killing the aspirations that drive them. 

Please do something meaningful with the STEM OPT extension.
