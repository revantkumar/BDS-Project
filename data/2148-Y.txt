American is a nation of immigrants. See what generations of immigrants have contributed to the country. That's one major reason why the US can always be the most powerful country in the world in the last several decades. New immigrants/Stem F-1 students from other countries like India and China are all very nice and hardworking. They deserve equal chances as the US citizens to compete for a job. That's also the spirit of the United States. 
F-1 students are all the smartest, most hardworking students from all over the world. With less barrier for them, there will be more competition. More competition for a job means higher quality of candidates. The employers can have more options and choose the best. That's why the high-tech companies in silicon valley nowadays are so energetic and can bet any companies all over the world. F-1 students are working hard to help the US keeping its competitiveness. 
By the way, many native Americans who oppose the Stem extension are descendants of immigrants. They oppose it just because they want to get a job more easily, not because it's beneficial to the US. 

To sum up, STEM extension for F-1 students is a win-win situation for both the US and the students. It may attract more and more excellent foreign students to come to the US and help US develop its economy in the future.
If it failed to be passed, it will be a great loss for the US. Standing still and refusal to progress will eventually do harm to itself.
