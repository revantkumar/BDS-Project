24 month STEM OPT extension is great! Especially for us who plan to study abroad, work for a few years and then back to home country with the experience, knowledge and skills that we achieved through working in U.S based on OPT and extension. I am in OPT extension work for a international tech company which hires lots of international students, lots of them after they return their home country are still keep in touch with company. Connections make opportunities, those who got chances to work in U.S would definitely be more familiar with U.S no matter culture or custom, which means if there we allow more international students to work in U.S they are all potential business partner in the future.If we wanna expand our business or market, it would be much easier if there are people whoever cooperate with us. To best improve that odds, we should recruit more international students, build more connections, offer more opportunities to let us know our study area, which is exactly the new OPT and extension policy will do. I root for this new policy not only for myself, but for the spectacular future which will exist between U.S and lots of countries. That sounds great! But only be possible if we support this new OPT and extension policy!!!
