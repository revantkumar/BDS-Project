OPT is not for illegals! All OPT applicants are legal to stay US to pursue higher education, and they have right to get the opportunity to practice their skills in real industry and get intern position like other US citizen students. Also, all international students pay tuition, medical insurance and tax as US citizens, they make a great contributions to local economy. As I can see, most college town now is more vigorous than other city as International student do help college town's economy, and that means these students create job for local people who run the business like car dealership, restaurants, and grocery stores. It is a shame that you even don't fully understand the OPT before you make such ridiculous comment
