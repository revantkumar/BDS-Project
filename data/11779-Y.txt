I strongly support the STEM extention proposal, mainly for two reasons:

First, In America nowadays, the STEM talent shortage is real. For example, citing USNEWS, ".... There are some 40,000 computer science bachelor's degree earners each year but roughly 4 million job vacancies for computer workers....". And it's similar case in other STEM related fields. I admit that improving American STEM education is the key; however this definitely can not be achieved with one stroke-- it takes years or even decades. American industry and economy would not want to fall behind, and they MUST utilize tremendous resources from outside, and that is F1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees.

Second, if STEM extension no longer exist, American higher education as a study-abroad destination will lose its attraction: hundred thousand students will choose Canada, Europe, Japan, or Australia. Consider it, this means giving up enonous amount of international students' tuition revenue , and their consumptive power.

Individuals, do not be short-sighted and just consider your personal lost or gain. The STEM labor market is huge. With so many vacancies, if you are really competent, your job will never be "stolen".
