Frank Ong I support the extension. Most STEM projects require years to complete. A 12-month OPT is simply too short for companies to evaluate student's OPT performance. Also, international students have historically contributed a lot to America's tech companies. Cutting the extension is a strong blow to the students and also tech companies.
