I find the program entitled F-1 Nonimmirant students with STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for all Eligible Students to be unfair to American kids. As parents of American kids, this idea is completely offensive and pathetic. We have an enormous amount of talent within our country and do NOT need to bring in kids from any other country in the world to take away our jobs, our education benefits and our life as American citizens. These people are users, freeloaders and they come to this country in bad faith. They are free to do what they want - even break the law and then disappear into our society. EVERY student and every person that is in this country under the pretense of becoming a VALID STEM STUDENT should NOT be allowed in this country. OUR opportunities are for OUR kids - they should stay home. We don't want them, we don't need them and we are tired of them using us. Our kids are intelligent, smart and deserve the opportunities that American taxpayers are prepared to give them. We owe foreigners NOTHING and they should NOT ASK to come to our country. 

American taxpayers are in a helluva spot these days - between illegal aliens stealing us blind (with the approval of our government) and these dishonorable STEM students coming here (with the approval of our government) seems as if our life is all about fighting off the freeloaders for us to support.
