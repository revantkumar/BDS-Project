Sung-Han Lin I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

(1) If international students cannot have the OPT extension, they cannot contribute what they learned to this country.

(2) There are not many American students doing fields about Science and Engineering. If there is not OPT extension, all those technical companies cannot achieve a big achievement.
