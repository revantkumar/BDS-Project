I strongly support this rule for several reasons. 
1.As we know, many companies train employees for several months, if foreign students are allowed only 1 year opt to work in United States, company will have to find replacement for the talent after one year. It will definitely be a waste of resources and is not good for production. 

2.It's good for US education. I believe longer OPT will attract more foreign students coming to US for study, which will certainly benefit education in United States. 

3. America promotes equal chance for everyone. Foreign students who spend so much time and money on education and left home for education deserve the opportunity to gain more experience in US companies. 

Thanks.
