Sharon Bolling The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be an extreme detriment to American technical workers, especially recent college graduates. Your ill-advised program (to allow U.S. companies to hire foreigners no matter whether they are pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S. or forever), would artificially bloat the pool of available workers for jobs (particularly in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields).

As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all technical workers. Furthermore, the program actually gives employers incentives to hire foreign students over American citizens because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.

Not only is this outside the purview of the Executive Branch of the federal government according to the United States Constitution, it is particularly imbecilic since our current unemployment rate among college graduates in technical disciplines keeps rising due to our stagnating economy.

I am vociferously and unequivocally OPPOSED to this rule change and expanding this program. America first for Americans!
