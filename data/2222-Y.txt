I strongly support this extenstion for the following reasons:
Talented International students need equal chance and deserve more time to practice their skills after graduation.
It's good for US economy and education.
OPT extension actually won't hurt anyone, because it doesn't necessarily lead to job competition with US citizens, many students are planning to gain skills in US and develop their careers in their home countries.
