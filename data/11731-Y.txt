As a STEM student who works in renewable energy field in US, I strongly support the pass of this Act, not only due to my own career interests and goal, but also for the benefits of the development of high technology and innovative industry in US. 

First of all, as I know, most of the STEM students holding F1 visa have very strong academic and professional background. Take my foreign friends, colleagues and classmates for example, they are from top universities and educational institutes in their home country before they came to US, and they all graduated from top 50 universities in US. They major in cutting edge field such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, Engineering Management and Environmental Management, and they work in companies and industries that play the role of backbone in US economy. They contributed their knowledge and intelligence to the development of this country, and they are paid at what they deserved. Therefore, Visa and Identity in US should be the least factor that block this group staying in US and make contribution. 

Second, personally speaking, I graduated from Duke University and got Master's degree. I work with my brilliant colleagues from diverse countries and experience the culture and intelligence melting everyday. Based on my experience, US native colleagues are offered the same level benefits as we are, and we really enjoy learning from each other and contribute to the company as a team. I think this is exactly one of the most important parts of American spirit. As a foreigner, I can see open culture and equality, and the possibilities to realize my career dream of mitigating climate change through collaborating with the most intelligent people. 

Therefore, I strongly support this Act and look forward to seeing it passed.
