I strongly support this new rule.

I believe stem opt is essential to the leading technology companies/industry in the United States. They need international students to fill the increasing demand for tech talents. As most tech projects in these companies take years to implement and it takes months to train a new graduate before he can do the real valuable things, OPT extension is a great idea to create a win-win situation for companies and students.

On the other hand, if stem students knows they will be just forced to go home after one year rookie training, they might not decide to come to the United States. That is because only years stem education without really getting into the tech industry in the United States, the US degree is not that valuable in their home countries. 

Considering the shrinking domestic education market and increasing international education market, the opportunities cost of canceling OPT extension is huge: a lot of US universities have to cut its budgets, decrease faculty funding and graduate program funding, which harms the leading status of the US universities. A lot of US companies have to outsource their jobs to overseas, and thus the US government will losses huge taxable incomes.

What's more, US needs more tech talents to fuel its economy. McKinsey predicted there will be a shortage of 140,000 - 200,000 data analyst by 2020; NYC is building its tech industry rapidly; Boston, Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, all these big cities are seeking tech talents to transform their industries. I would argue that with STEM extension, these goals will realize much sooner.
