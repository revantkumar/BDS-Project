SUPPORT the proposal.

It is necessary to provide more than 3 years training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. 
For US companies, they need talented students. If the proposal cannot pass, lots of outstanding students will not have chance to contribute to US. In addition, it will decrease the passion of brilliant international students to seek education in American University, which will further slow down the growth of number of highly-educated students.

For international students, US is an ideal country for them to practice and improve their skills because the environment of US encourages innovation. Many of the innovative ideas are from international students after they accumulate the industry experience. It will be a pity that such innovation becomes more difficult to see just because of our policy is not friendly to foreign students.

For the problem some American citizens concern: The competition. It does exist, but it is a kind of good mechanism for the whole society. Some citizens' difficulty in job hunting results from their low competitiveness, but not the number of international students. If the proposal cannot pass, American young adults will become less and less competitive. In fact, it is even more difficulty for international students to find a job or an internship because of the visa status. Companies tend to hire candidates with more stable status, when all the candidates have similar level of skills.
