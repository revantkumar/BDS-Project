Grace Wen I think OPT extension up to 36 months is even more important to US employers than STEM students themselves. 

First, I want to say I am grateful for those employers who are willing to give STEM students chance. They take the risk of hiring someone who may be forced to leave after 2 years employment. It is not a very efficient operation model. Those companies are not charity parities, why they choose to take the risk? The reason is very simple, STEM American workers are not enough for them in job market! If an employer wanted to hire someone to do model or math staffs, they have to hire a Chinese or Indian, since only they applied for those positions or they are much better than Americans applying for the same positions. Therefore, same as OPT students themselves, their employers face unstable future as well.

OPT extension up to 36 months could provide both parties more security. Even if an international employee could not get H1B through his employment, three years are enough for him and his team to work on some big projects and develop new products. One year for developing, one for testing and improving and the last year for introducing it to client and modifying new product based on clients feedback. Three years are perfect time to bring an idea into reality and finally use it to make money. 

In summary, OPT extension gives employers more chance to realize international workers value and in return, OPT students get more opportunities to be hired.
