OPT extension for STEM students is necessary because 1) Foreign STEM students want to contribute to the US after the US has invested in their education for many years. 2) The current working visa limit is rather strict in number and in time frame. 3) The need for Foreign STEM students is urgent. 

STEM students have the longest training to obtain their PhD in the United States. US has provided the most outstanding training for students from all over the world. Reasonably, the US may want something in return from the students after they are well-trained. We, the trained foreign graduates, do want to add values to this country as a return too. However, due to the strict working visa policy, it is extremely hard for new graduates to obtain working authorization right after they graduate, and thus OPT and the extension to OPT serve as a crucial buffering period, so that the STEM graduates can work for the US without any delay after they finish their trainings. 

Some may worry that hiring the STEM PhD will reduce job opportunities for others. This is UNTRUE. The trainings STEM students received are highly specialized, and therefore the jobs they are suitable for are also highly specialized. It is very unlikely that these jobs can be done by someone who is not from the STEM fields. It is obvious if one takes a look into the job openings that recruit STEM graduates, these can be done only by STEM graduates, and there are definitely more job openings than the number of American STEM graduates that would take these jobs. Therefore, there is an urgent need for foreign STEM graduates for American corporates and organizations.
