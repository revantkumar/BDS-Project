Bruce anonymous Foreign students do not cost US a dime, but brings in tens of millions of dollars to our economy.

I own a small bookstore close to the University of Kentucky's campus. At the end of the semester, families of the students come into town and will shop in my store. 

Our economy has been better days. For the past few years, my biggest customers are families of foreign students. Each family will buy thousands of dollars of souvenir. I am very thankful that foreign students are stimulating our economy. Personally, I would have gone bankrupted a long time ago, if it was not for them.

Please be friendly to them, and keep them coming.

I support OPT program
