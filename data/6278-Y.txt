I totally agree on this rule.
China and India have been spending trillions of dollar on high tech industry for years and are about to become the industry leader. One of the most important reasons is that they have the most brilliant brains. These talents get education in US and go back serving China. Actually, most of them are willing to work in US but couldn't, for they don't have a legal status. By extending the OPT, these students have chances to work for US companies and serve US. 
Therefore, OPT extension rule helps US retain the best high-skill people and maintain leadership in high-tech industry, which will benefit US eventually.
