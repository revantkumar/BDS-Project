I see no reason some comments say international students will take those work positions that should belongs to American citizens.

1. Lots of companies in US need a great number of qualified employees to complete their programs that can realize the development and stability of the society.

2. STEM graduates consist large part of such kind of employee.

3. Most of native American students prefer majors in other field, which means the number of well-trained US citizens much less than the need of those companies.

4. One should see there's almost no complaint from US students major in STEM.

5. International STEM students are important both for those companies and US society.

6. STEM extension means a lot.
