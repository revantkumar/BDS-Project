I strongly support this action. It could benefit the US's technology industry as well as those foreign students that work so hard to pursue their American dreams. Currently, the H1-B lottery becomes more and more tough because some IT consulting companies try to file multiple H1-B applications for only one employee. This breaks the fairness and hurt the true students. This STEM extensions can give these qualified students more time and chance and eventually help the USA's economy.
