I feel that STEM OPT extension is very much needed for Students coming under F1 visa, as it not only give them chance to explore the job and work culture in USA properly which they can utilize once they move back to their native country the but also strengthens US stand as favorable study destination for foreign students.

Also it helps the US industry to get highly skilled employees and retain them.
