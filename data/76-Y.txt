I'm a F1 student in electrical engineering and I think it is good for America to further extend OPT for STEM major. 

US industry needs a lot of engineers in our field. However, no matter in campus or in industry, I saw very few US citizen in this field. In such case, it will be very hard for employer to find skilled American employee in Electrical Engineering major and the research institution can hardly find enough talented students to continue their research . 

As we know, STEM major greatly contributes to economy. So improving and expanding the training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students would greatly benefit American economy, since it will firmly provide enough talented students for employer to find better candidate and also avoid the turbulent when they cannot find enough candidate in short term.

Also I remember even in the career fairs I attended, I saw a lot of positions are only opened to green card holder or US citizens. I never ever see a position only opened for "F1 students with OPT". Based on these observations, I strongly believe the existence of F1 OPT students would be beneficial to America.
