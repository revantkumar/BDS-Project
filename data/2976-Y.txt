As many high skilled foreign workers have planned for, the path from OPT to H1B and then to Permanent Residency is not an easy one to take. On one hand, America opens its door for those who are high skilled, on the other hand, some companies abuse the wide open door policy and flushes in "not so highly skilled" foreign workers. We know those companies names, but no action has ever been taken. Instead, people think vacate the OPT Extension Program would solve the issue. Or, they just think about themselves because it is always good to have less competition, higher pay and less work--exactly what some unions are after. 
We all know there are some issues with the current immigration policy, and we all know who are causing the issues. People should focus their attention on the causes, but no on the people who are innocent. 
Here are the right things to do:
1. Re-establish and enhance the OPT Extension Program
2. Investigate companies who are abusing the H1B program and take actions
3. Create a clearer path for those high skilled workers who want to stay in the US
