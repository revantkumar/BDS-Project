Xiaoyu Zheng Dear Chief Westerlund:

I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.

I strongly support the new rule. The new rule brings lots of benefits to high technology companies in United States. It will make more talents work for high technology companies and make high technology companies more stable. I'm an international student and graduate with a master degree in Computer Engineer. When I was a grad student, lots of grad students were international students, which means the ratio of international students majoring in STEM is very large. Longer OPT extension period could make more talents stay in United States and work for high technology companies. Also, in the high technology company I working for, I noticed that most new hires are international students. With 24 months OPT extension, our company would be more stable, since with longer OPT extension period, more new hires could obtain H1-B and continue to work in United States. If many new hires are forced to leave United States, because of not obtaining H1-B and shorter OPT extension, our company will lose a lot of talents, which is a big loss to our company. Many high technology companies are facing the same problem. 

With this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.

Sincerely,
Xiaoyu
