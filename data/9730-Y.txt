First of all, I'm so glad to know that DHS has propose this rule.
As a F-1 visa student majored in STEM, this rule will directly benefit me by giving the opportunity to work longer at USA.It's good for F-1 student.
What's more, I thinks this rule will benefit USA itself more than the non-immigrant students.
First, a lot of STEM project/work need a long time to get the research result, especially for those large project that will accelerate the technology for USA, 36 months is a more appropriate than 12 months.
Second, these non-immigrant students themselves are also treasures as well as their work. 36 months of OPT work, will bring USA priceless fortune, not only technology, but also economy and moral of the whole society.
Third, these non USA citizen students will build a health competitive job market, which will bring the country full of vigor.
Last, when those students return back to their own country, 3 years work at USA will be their preciousness experience and make them have deeper affection for USA then just 12 months, this will build up USA much more international impact and connect the world more intimately.
If this rule haven't be passed. For me and all other F-1 STEM students, we just back to our countries earlier, with well education, they can build they career everywhere. However, the USA provide us the best education in the world, after that, then just send us away, even we have spend tuition and live support fees at USA, I still think this is kind of charity for other countries and don't mention the huge scholarships every year.
I think pass this rule is win-win and reject would damage USA'w own benefit more than these skilled students.
