I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for expanding OPT for international students with STEM degrees. The reasons are as follows:

1.There is still gap between the demand and supply of skilled labor in computer science, statistics, electrical engineering and so on. Employing international students professional in these fields will ensure a prosper future for the industry of USA in terms of enough supply of labor.

2.It is beneficial for the government if more people are employed rather than keep the positions vacant without employing any qualified workers as it will increase the tax income significantly, which will certainly alleviate the social burden.

3.In terms of the companies, it will be more productive if it employs more skilled workers. In fact, in the industry related to STEM majors, international graduates are playing an important role especially in the R&D department. Diversity in staff ensures a working environment where comprehensive thinking ideas will be taken into account.
