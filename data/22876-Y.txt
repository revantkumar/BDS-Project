I have a STEM degree and have been forced into an area other than what my degree covers to remain gainfully employed. My company seems to have a policy of replacing experienced American STEM workers with H-1B and former student visa holders as a cost savings policy. 

If you are an American with a STEM degree, you are an endangered species in the work force, and government policies like this one are the primary reason. 

I have two very gifted children who I will NOT allow to go to college to get STEM degrees if this policy goes into effect. They would be running up student debt with no hope of ever paying it back.
