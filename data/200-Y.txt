I graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in engineering. I'm currently working for an American company. It doesn't take me too long to become the critical person in my department because of my education and intelligence. My company will suffer a lot if loosing me suddenly. Most of foreign students are elites from their countries. And I can definitely say that they are much better than the majority of most American people, based on their education, intelligence, and internatioanl perspective. American economy is currently at a very critical stage, it definitely needs these foreign elites to work for this country especially in those high tech area such as chemical, biological, electrical and computer engineering and science. America will never truly recover from economic crisis if loosing these people.
