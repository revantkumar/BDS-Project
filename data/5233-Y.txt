I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for STEM OPT Improvement which is not a bad thing for US citizens. The opportunities for working a few years after finishing college work or graduate school are the most inviting and competitive things of the higher education in United States because it is the work experience that makes international students competitive when they go back to their countries. It should be noted that the large number of international students bring about not only benefits for colleges but a huge need of consumption that stimulates the economy all over the country. In other words, these foreign consumers somehow create a great many job opportunities for hard-working Americans. Denying the OPT is denying the huge population of these foreign consumers, which will depress the growth of economy. Moreover, STEM students do bring some competitions but in fact more fulfillment of the industries. International students are hired for "TEMPORARY" positions which are not a threat to US citizens.
