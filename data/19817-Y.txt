The new OPT extended period is what necessary for this country to stay strong in science, technology and math. I have been helping international students looking for post-graduation opportunities for 15 years and have seen many tallanted people had to go home when we really needed them. The current OPT 12-month limit and the work visa quota are hurting the economy by letting many American-trained scientists and engineers to work for our competitors in Asia and else where. I really hope that the congress will pass immigration reform and open more doors for qualified international people to come and work in the United States.
