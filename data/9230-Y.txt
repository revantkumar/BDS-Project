Bharath Sivaraman I appreciate the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.
As an International student, I would like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the large number of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated F1 students who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements.
It is not the cheap labor that allows international students to get STEM jobs, but genuine interest and eligibility (due to advanced degrees).
So I conclude STEM OPT Extension is must.
