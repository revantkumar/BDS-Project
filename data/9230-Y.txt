I strongly support the OPT STEM extension. Both the US and the international students can benefit from this program a lot. 

From the US side, the government has made great effort to bring up excellent scientists and engineers, among which many of them are international students. Its not a wise choice to let them go back to their own country with what they have been taught in America. With a 2 ~ 3 years OPT program, the graduates will be able to conduct some new state of the art researches, which may lead to new technology and change the world. It definitely cannot be achieved in a short period, thats why a longer OPT is preferred. If the OPT program cease, many intelligent people wont have the chance to contribute to the US society, which is a big loss. 

US is the country with most international students. A key factor is that it provides the opportunity for them to work after graduation, helping them apply what they have learnt into real life. It doesnt mean to seize job opportunity from local people, but just a part of their life experience abroad, which serves as a big advantage when they start life in their own country. Without this OPT program, US may lose its attract to international students. They may choose to go to similar countries but at lower expenses.

From the international students perspective, this OPT program is a good way for them to gain hands on experiences, get access to newest technology, concept and know the trend in their own field. It can broaden their horizons and make a smooth transition from student to a social being.

In summary, OPT STEM should be supported and understood by more people.
