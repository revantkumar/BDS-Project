I strongly support the proposed extension. The STEM trained foreign born graduates are among the smartest people on the earth. They can perfectly make up for the lack of US born STEM talents. To maintain the leadership position, US needs to keep the world first class talents. Given the lower rate of successful application of H1B, this proposed extension of training period for STEM graduates is a very effective way to keep the badly needed talents. Please note the non US born STEP students are not taking away job opportunities from Americans. They help US solve the problem of not sufficient US born youth taking the STEM training. I am an executive working for a top financial firm. When I recruit for talents which require people with STEM background, I could not find enough US born candidates. Therefore, I have to consider many foreign born candidates. A simple fact is STEM trained graduates are highly sought-after talents. If US does not take them, other countries will. If this happens, US soon will lose her competitive advantage and in turn hurt everybody including those who oppose the proposed extension. Please ACT!
