We have to face three big issues in the following ten years if F-1 students cannot work in US after they graduate:
1. IT industry will be significantly impacted. Large amount of engineers have to leave due to the status problem. If the F-1 students only have 12 months to stay here, they will need 3 months to find a job, 3 months to be trained and only 6 months for working here. Which company would like to hire a F-1 student for working 6 months? If no, where can they find enough engineers for coding and debugging?
2. US will loose large amounts of high-tech engineers. Most F-1 students in STEM are graduate students and for many graduate programs, F-1 students are the majority. They are smart and they receive high level education. If they don't have the opportunities to work here, they will contribute their brain to their countries. One day, there will be not only "made in China" or "made in India", but "invented in China" or "invented in India". 
3. Studying in US is not as attractive as before for them. Government and institutions can get benefit from tuition and fees paid by F-1 students. If they cannot see the enough benefits to study here, they may not want to come to US.
In conclusion, it is critical to have the F-1 students to work after their graduation for at least 2 years.
