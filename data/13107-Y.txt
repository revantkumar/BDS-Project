I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. Here are the reasons:

1.If there is no extension on OPT for STEM F1 students, the number of F1 students will decrease sharply, undermining the financial situations in US higher education system. Obtaining work experiences is one of the most important motivations for F1 students to pay tuition and study at United States. The amount of their tuition contributes to a substantial portion in United States education system; in some top universities, the proportion of foreign students can be as high as 80%. If there is no extension, there will be harmful impact to US higher education system.

2.Extension of OPT does not hurt US citizens. Only positions that cannot be filled by US citizens are allowed to be filled by F1 students with OPT. If there is no extension, it is harder for companies to fill those positions and it will hurt those companies and even certain industries.
