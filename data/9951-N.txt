This is absurd to move forward on extending F-1 Nonimmigrant Students over and above millions of unemployed recent American college graduates, especially unemployed American Science, Technology, Engineering graduates.

STOP the liberal promotion of F-1 opportunities and give the unemployed American college graduates the opportunities we deserve. If the positions are not filled within 18 months of advertisement for American college graduate citizens, then we can pursue foreign workers on a temporary basis, without any immigration promises.

Make America Great Again.
