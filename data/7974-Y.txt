I strongly SUPPORT the proposal to extend OPT to a total of 36 months for international STEM students. It creates a win-win situation for both U.S. economy and international students. Science and technology have been boosting U.S economy for decades, and talents from foreign countries have been contributing their technical skills and brainpower to American companies and organizations. Extending OPT helps American corporates to attract and keep more international talents working for them, and maintain the advantage over international competitors. Extending OPT also helps general Americans who may see more international workforce as threat to their life. Why? International students pay higher tuitions than in-state students in college, which indirectly fund public higher education and save tax-payers money. Millions of international students creates huge demand in every single aspect of economy, and demand is one of the key factor in U.S. economy recovery. Better economy means more jobs, both stem and non-stem jobs. Since international students can only find major-related jobs, all the non-stem jobs created will go to American workers. For centuries, Immigrants created the great American history. Well-educated international STEM students are going to make America even greater!
