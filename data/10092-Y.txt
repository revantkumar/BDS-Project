I support the proposed rule of improving and expanding OPT period for F1 students. US has attracted a lot of international students for its high quality education as well as the following job opportunities. The country also benefits from the well trained work labor from graduated international students. The OPT extension and improvement would help international students obtain legal H1B visa status and contribute to US economy.

US is well-known as an immigration country and historically a lot of international professionals have come to US and made great contribution. It would allow more chance that current international talents have more time to get used to US working environment, obtain H1B visa and cooperated with US work labors. US workers will find more job chances and improved productivity thanks to the input from graduating international students.
