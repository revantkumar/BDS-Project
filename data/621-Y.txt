The OPT STEM extension is a boon for the international students who come to USA to pursue higher studies and make their career in the relevant fields. It does not give them the right or an open door to take on the jobs of the US citizens. Instead, it gives them an opportunity to utilize their skills and show their talent, in turn contributing to the US economy. OPT STEM extension does not affect the eligibility of a person, be it US citizen or international, for a job opportunity available in the market. If a student is capable enough, skilled, experienced, and ready to learn and take on new challenges, he/she will be selected for the role he/she deserves. Since its very difficult for any international student to settle down in the US, due to the immigration rules, the OPT STEM extension is a big help for them to live and prosper in the world's most amazing and modern country. Hence, OPT STEM extension rule should be valid and not terminated.
