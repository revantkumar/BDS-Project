Robert Eschef I still can not believe that the US government deems that any type of immigration is mandatory and screwed it's US citizens over and over again. This emulation will allow these students to end up staying without any mandatory things they need to do the us taxpayer ends up paying or losing their own jobs because of immigration in one form shape or another. US corporations should be looking at US citizens for anything, should be training US citizens not citizens of the world countries. We have close to ten million Americans without work and this government want more immigration? These students many of whom will stay here in the US may become good citizens but may not. I say no close this OPT down And force American companies to train and hire the American citizen
