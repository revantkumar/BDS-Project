I am keen to gain industry exposure in the area of my interest which I intend to leverage for my Doctoral studies in the future. Such an opportunity would be missed if I cannot complete my OPT and repay my study loan most of which was already spent in the US. I believe lot of students if not all might also be in the same boat. Hope that this law will be brought into effect as soon as possible providing enough visibility to employees and employers alike by the beginning of the next hiring season which can have a huge positive impact on everyone including the economy.
