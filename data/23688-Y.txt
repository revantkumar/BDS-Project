It's immigration who makes United States great. I dont think its a good idea to kick STEM students out of this country. Competition is what makes a good economy.I think anybody who try to make a statement that blamed people original from outside the country took jobs away has already lose the spirit of America. The statement is flawed by itself, and is based on cowardnss and self seclusion. What makes a country great is its openness, and what makes a person great is its openness too.
