I support this proposal. America is the most powerful country because how diverse and accommodating its society is. STEM students are NOT ILLEGAL CHEAP LABOR NOR IMMIGRANT WORKERS. They come through forests of legal procedures. My experience with some of my friends coming from such background shows great intelligence and insights that may help America to stay on top of the world.

Extremism is never the way to go. Also, please do some research before you throw negative comments and stop using templates from anti-diversity/anti-immigrant groups. Babbling about non-facts about international STEM students and scholars being cheap labors and hurting the US job market does not help America to advance its economy and tech industry.
