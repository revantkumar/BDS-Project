As a business owner, I strongly support the 24-month OPT extension proposal. 

We need a longer period for our workers in OPT status to finish their projects in hand. Most of them joined our team one year ago and is applying OPT extension in order to continue work in the current projects. Our projects normally last three years and that's the reason we welcome the 24-month OPT extension and would benefit from it. Can't wait for the pass of proposal.
