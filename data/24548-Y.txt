I totally SUPPORT this opt-extension rule. I got my master degree from Purdue University and I'm working as a mechanical engineer now. We STEM employees have made huge contributions to thousands of corporations in the United States from the first we came here. We apply the knowledge and skills we learnt from universities to different projects which brings huge profits and greatly simulate US economy. I see some comments arguing that we international STEM talents rob jobs from the American citizens. This is totally ridiculous. Do they know how hard it is to find a job in the United States for international students? Do they know how much we have paid for the education here? Do they know how huge contribution we have made? We are not illegal immigrants, we have legal status. Personally speaking, I totally have NO intention to become an immigrant. I just want to apply my knowledge and skills here. What's wrong with that???? Always remember one thing, only weak people keep finding excuses. Strong and powerful people will always be able to find their ideal jobs!!

Again, I totally SUPPORT the opt-extension rule!!!! Please approve it, for the benefit of international employees, US citizens, thousands of companies and the Nation of United States!!!
