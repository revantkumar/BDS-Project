What a "shame" that another step has been taken to subjugate American Graduates to Foreign Students!!!

Giving employers such an incentive (no payroll taxes) hurts the rest of the Citizens who do not have special treatments.

Do we not have some feeling for "our own"? Shame on us...What about beeing FAIR ... a LEVEL Playing Field.

What ever happened to "America First"--Let's be reasonable !!!!!!!
