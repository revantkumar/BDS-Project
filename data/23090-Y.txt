I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. University is very important for the U.S. As is know to all, great achievement were obtained by some foreigners who were international students when they were in college.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It is a benefit that U.S. can select high-level people from both local people and international students, improving U.S.'s competitiveness in the world.
