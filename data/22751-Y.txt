I would like to register my strong support for the OPT extension currently under review. From a policy perspective, I understand that the economic consequences for U.S. citizens is the primary consideration. On this subject the consensus is clear. Immigration is a net positive for the U.S. economy, due to the increase in working-age population (contributing to GDP), increased demand for goods and services (which are mainly provided by U.S. citizens), and increased tax revenue. Moreover, since technological progress is the main driver of economic growth, attracting the most talented workers from around the globe to U.S. firms is vital to our future prosperity. The OPT extension will thus be very beneficial, as it will provide a crucial window of opportunity for recent graduates to secure the best possible employment for their highly demanded skills.

At this point, however, I must confess that my main motivations for supporting this policy are personal and intangible. As a professor of electrical engineering at a U.S. university, I have spent my entire working life interacting with non-U.S. citizens studying under student visas. I can say unequivocally that these students embody the very best American virtues of hard work, education, diversity, and community spirit. After spending years assimilating into this country via the university system, they are ready and willing to contribute to the American economy and become part of the national fabric. The first step in this journey is finding a job and transitioning to the work visa program. They have earned that opportunity.
