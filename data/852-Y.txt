As an American born in this country and also a friend of many international students in STEM majors, I support a policy that would ensure that they can apply their skills in the workforce. These hardworking students came to the United States with the understanding that this country was open to them and I believe that this understanding should hold true. We have much to gain as a country from the insights and skills these students bring.
