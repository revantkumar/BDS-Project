Cheng Cheng I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. First, it's good for US economy which highly depends on high technology industry and science because it attracts more STEM talents come to study and work here. Second, 24 months extension is good for international STEM students to accumulate experience before they go back to their own country, and eventually attracts more talents to come here.
