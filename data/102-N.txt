By the mere fact of allowing this program to be continued, the ICEB continues to put foreigners ahead of well
deserving Americans. This undermines the American job community and allows those that live here as citizens at a risk of being unable to provide for their own families. Hasn't 9/11 taught us anything? Why allow more foreigners in this country on unvetted work visas? This is preposterous and must be stopped. We, the American people have had enough. Please reconsider this program.
