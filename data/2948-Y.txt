Joseph Scott You must be aware about thousands of dollars international students pore in the US economy every year by paying huge international fees. International students also help promote a global learning environment. Our country has reached on top of the world because of the technology and because of this rule actually the whole world is contributing towards the technological growth of our country. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.
