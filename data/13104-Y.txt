I strongly support this extension.
I am a master student in computer science and I come from China. The main reason why I come to US is that I want to gain several year's working experiences in US after graduation which will help me get a higher position after I come back to China.
I think OPT extension is perfect for me as I am willing to spend about 2 or 3 years in US after graduation and then I'll go back. And it does benefits to US as well. We come to US because there are more chances for us to find a job, and if there is no OPT, a lot employers will take that into consideration and they will not hire as many international students as they are current doing. Then why we do not go to other countries e.g. Canada and Australia for study? We pay the tuition here, and we spend a lot of money on rent along with other living expenses. If there is no OPT extension, fewer international students will come to US. In this case, not only those high tech companies like Google, Amazon and Oracle will suffer, but also those Americans who rent their houses to international students or do small business near university campuses will have lower income.
