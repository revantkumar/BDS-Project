Think about this, foreign student pay for US education and pay for US products. They bring profit and revenue. As long as they stay at US, they keep giving their money to US companies and universities. 
As far as I known, many foreign students come from wealth family and have quite reasonable purchase ability. The more they purchase, the more US companies earn and the more salary everyone will gain.

The most important thing is that for most foreign students, they don't want to stay at America forever at all! They just want to pay US education institutions and company money and labor to gain a good resume and go back to where they come from. They won't occupy those working positions forever. 

So just give them the extension, let them spend more at US and maybe 3 or 5 years later, they will leave this country and left great amount of money earned by their parents to US.

Let them stay longer and let them spent more!
