I would like to see our so called representatives fulfill their oath to follow the constitution and do the will of the 
people they promised to represent!!
Had they done their jobs the imposter and chief would not be in the white house,
the government would not be 16 trillion in debt and our borders would not have been over run.
We need to reduce the size of government stop the duplication of services, close/stop the entitlement programs for our
citizens as well as illegal aliens, not allow US birth certificates for illegals of any nationality.
Why are we supporting countries who's intent is to destroy our nation and our allies??? 
Customs and immigration are not doing their jobs as it is what's the point of increasing their numbers?? 
lets get back to running this country THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE RUN , BY HONORABLE REPRESENTATIVES
AND TERM LIMITS WITHOUT SPECIAL RETIREMENT PLANS AND ALL THE OTHER BENEFITS THEY HAVE AWARDED
THEMSELVES OVER THE PAST 50 YEARS!!!
