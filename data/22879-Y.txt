To whom it may concern, 

I strongly support this proposal and firmly believe, once approved, it will be beneficial to United States as a whole. I know there is some thoughts going on like "foreigners are taking the jobs from the native." As an international student, I think it's not the case. International students are usually taking on the jobs that require years of accumulation in one area, which means a narrower career choice, if dismissed, in the future. Actually internationally students are taking the risk and doing the jobs that many of the United States citizens don't want to do or lack the skill to do. Therefore, the demand from companies do exist and it can not be substituted well only by local people. The US. economy consists of the companies. If they are doing well, the US. economy will do greatly. Since the logic is clear here, I request for the approval of this proposal. It will be a win-win game and beneficial to the society. 

Thanks for your kind attention.
