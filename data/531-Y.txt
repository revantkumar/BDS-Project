With unemployment reaching higher percentages and people still having a hard time recovering from the last recession (no, it's not over from 2007-2008, folks, we're not stupid), it is not only against what Americans are fed up with; i.e., doing the exact opposite of what the government knows they should be doing to strengthen the Economy. Hire Americans, bring our jobs back instead of being imperialistically global, and we as a country will cease to be headed toward being a third world country. Remember, you are elected to your positions to serve the will of the people!
