Haoxing Bai I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons

1. The government should leave international students who learned knowledge from US Univeristies to contribute what they learned back to the society of US. 
2. This country is a country of freedomour international students are not requiring some priviledge our the native guys but applying for a chance that enables us to compete with native people equally. Everyone should get a chance to survive and prosper in this land. We really don't want to get blocked to from this freedom of working hard and getting the chance to contribute to ths US-the country we really like and trust.
