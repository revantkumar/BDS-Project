William Stephens Is it true that OPT workers often hold jobs that pay between $60-$90,000 a year , but they cost our Social Security system about $1 billion dollars a year?

The GAO issued a report in 2014 finding that this program is full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud and that the Department is not adequately overseeing it. The GAO also found a major national security problem in that the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in this country! I want to know that the OPT program has been secured and all of these students have been located and accounted for.

Is it true that U.S. employers are given a substantial bonus for hiring an alien graduate rather than an American college graduate with the same skills and the same salary, I have heard that this bonus can be over $10,000 dollars.
Please explain to me as to why you would put our American graduates at such a disadvantage in the hiring process and as to why this bonus is necessary if there really is a shortage of STEM workers coming out of our Universities.
