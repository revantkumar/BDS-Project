I believe it's wrong to cut the opt of STEM students in USA. It's important for these students stay longer and work in all those American big companies. Once government cut the STEM OPT stay period, I am afraid that a major number of American big companies will suffer too much. I don't believe they can deal with the loss of talent people in their company.
