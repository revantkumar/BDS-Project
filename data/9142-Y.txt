I strongly support this new OPT extension rule because this is not only benefits the international students by practicing what they learn in school in real life but also the hiring company and entire american society by having those energetic innovative young talents attracted by this OPT extension. 

I was an international student at boston university majoring in material science and technology. During the two years at boston university, i met a lot of the best professors around the world and learned a lot not only in material science but also other fields like biomedical engineering and computer engineering,etc. It was just such diversities in my school make me more competitive and integrated than students graduated from other universities. OPT extension is the best opportunities to attract lots of the young talent all over the world to united states which greatly diversified american society and STEM field. It just because such diversity make entire science and engineering in US more innovative more creative than any other countries around the world. If US losing this OPT extension program, it will be detrimental to STEM field and entire american economy. 

I am working at saint gobain R&D department a french forbes 500 company at Massachusetts. At R&D center northborough, we have almost 20-30% of new hires using this OPT and OPT extension every year. Each year, they are contributing almost 40-50% of the new US patent to our company. In my company, 20-30% of people coming from france or other european countries and about 20% of people coming from Asia, like china, india etc which makes saint gobain a very international company. people coming from different country bring their own culture, way of thinking and languages that truly make us more competitive because this will help the company to learn better their customer from their employees. It is not adding something to old system, it is like adding another dimension into old system which make them entirely new.
