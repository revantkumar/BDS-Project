xiaoliang li I support this extension policy because it meet American people's benefit. 

The extension policy will not add the number of H1B and green card given out each year, and will not increase the total number of long-term residence in the United States. Those who are working using a OPT extension are young people with healthy body and great energy. They pay their tax and insurance but no one use old-age pension or seldom use their healthy insurance. What they are creating is much more than what they are consuming for this society. How stupid we are to get these young people out off the USA?
