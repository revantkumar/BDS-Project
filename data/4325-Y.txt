I strongly support the proposal for following reasons
1. Freedom and diversity and equality are what matters to the US. The extension will avails more students to build their career in the most advanced industry in the world. They will make contributions to US and the world no matter if they remains inside US or leave the country later. 
2. Industries related to STEM majors in US is experiencing a lack of Human Resource. Failing to extend the OPT will result in a huge loss in competitive employees in US and will have negative effect on the US industry.
3. International students are not taking away US people jobs. If it's a free and equal market, skills are what matters. It's a total equal environment. 
4. American dreams means everybody is provided with equal chances to fulfill their dream and prosper in US. If the extension is taken, it's against the American Dream.
