Chloe Young There is no doubt that the STEM OPT extension brings incalculable benefits to U.S! It's universal believed that the situation in the company is quite different the one in the university. The future dream job one assumed as a graduate student might not be suitable for him when he works in the company. And one can never know whether his dream job matches his own interest and ability until he is experiencing what is his job. But for international students, especially for the top-level STEM talents, twelve months is too short to get to know which area they want to contribute to for their whole life, especially for those who find that he cannot make full use of his various abilities in his present job and wish to switch to another job.

Those top-level STEM talents have studied really hard for almost 24-28 years to foster the various abilities, but will be compelled to choose the certain job in twelve months. Don't you think it's too ridiculous? How can they think critically to decide whether the job matches him and whether he matches the job in such a short period? However, the fact is if they don't choose a job quickly, they will be forced to leave America, the land they love and wish to contribute to.

Some may argue that such top-level STEM talents will compete the job opportunities with the native residents. However, I'd like to point out that without the influx of international talents, our science and technology, even the economy, will lose the energy and therefore our citizens will enjoy fewer opportunities. STEM talents are not taking jobs away from the citizens. On the contrary, they are creating more job opportunities by contributing to the development of high technology.
