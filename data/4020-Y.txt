I strongly support expanding STEM OPT for F1 students. 
This expanded OPT program attracts many students, especially STEM students come to US for study and they pay tuition at very high rate. The living expense and tuition they paid greatly improves the local economies and provide job opportunities for US-citizens. Some comments show their hesitation regarding the opportunity for US-resident students may become less when applying for universities. However, this is not true. Clear statics show that the universities are increasing the number of total student admitted in recent years at no sacrifice of the number of US-resident students. The extra number of international students brings extra income to the region. The attraction to international college students will be negatively affected if OPT for STEM is as short as 12 month. Instead, they will prefer universities in countries like Australia, China and etc, where the tuition/living expense are much lower, and the student training program is much better. 
Students in STEM OPT program are highly professional in their own narrow field. And they are only allowed to work in the exact field. US-citizens are always the priority consideration for any STEM job opportunity. However, there is still a lack of suitable job candidates in STEM. This is the only case when international students get considered. In the fields other than their study field, international students are not allowed to work at all. It is not true that these international students are competing with any US-citizens, especially for STEM fields. 
STEM OPT is a student training program, which aims to attract more international students and provides full study experience to STEM students. It does not harm any existing job opportunities for US-citizens.
