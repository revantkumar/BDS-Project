I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S
2. Diversity is so important at U.S. There are lots of people has been make a difference who studied at U.S. before and use OPT to stay for the first couple of years. 
3. Although there is competition exist, there are not enough U.S. citizens for those jobs. In addition, such kind of competition also make those citizens study even harder to obtain those jobs.
