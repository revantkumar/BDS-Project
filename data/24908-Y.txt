The U.S. has always been one of the most innovative state in the world. Some of the innovations are brought by the awesome immigrants who receive education in the U.S. and have huge potential of contributions to the society. Stopping the OPT extension and the immigrant friendly policies will hurt the U.S. in a long run. You are officially saying "we don't want those smart people who do good to the society and please send them home. Let other countries enjoy the innovations and we are feeling good to stay where we are today." OPT extension and OPT policy create win-win situation, not hurting the domestic job market.
