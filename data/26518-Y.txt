It is hard to believe a federal agency would have a rule that puts immigrant students ahead of USA students for STEM job opportunities. That rule is a disgrace. I would like to see whoever is responsible for the rule, and whoever helped to make this rule, fired for incompetence with a undesirable job recommendation.
To offset this incompetence, the new rule should require all employers seeking job applicants to do a national search for several months. The job search should be done by a national company that is totally separate from the government. Only after this search fails to find someone, can a employer look for an immigrant. The prospective employer will then have to submit endless volumes of paperwork to the government to justify seeking to hire an immigrant. The government is very good at making endless volumes of worthless paperwork. This would encourage employers to look closer for a student form here. Then, that immigrant must be paid the same wage that the citizen would be paid. 
The government should then do something to make students from here more attracted to STEM jobs, something like, paid off student loans after working for several years (6-10) in a STEM field.
