I strongly support this proposal. 

International students pay thousands of dollars every year for America University, this is a big support for the scientific research of Universities. And they also pay high rent for landlord of house or apartment near the University. They contribute a lot to American economy. If OPT extension is cancelled, most students will select other countries for their education, like Singapore, Germany which has low tuition fee.

The extension is only for STEM students now. Many scientific and engineers are international students, they contribute a lot to the development of technology in America, making the top 1 in the world. Not allowing students working here for a few years will bring big loss to the country.

All in all, OPT extension is really important and beneficial for the U.S.
