I strongly recommend this proposal for the following reasons:

1. Elites from all over the world who can have a chance to stay longer will definitely help to boost the US economy.

2. Equality, which is highly appreciated and adovocated, should be extended to every individual as long as he/she can contribute to this country. So students really deserve more time to apply their skills to the real life after graduation.

3. Longer OPT will unequivocally attract more top students to US, which will benefit US in all aspects.

4. Longer OPT means more competitive job markets, and only those who trulty stand out can be employed, which is a very good way to promote the caliber of the employees.
