I believe STEM extension is good for US economy and industries and this should be adopted for F1 students.

At present there are few American students in STEM disciplines for example Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering compared to the high demand from employers in different industries. So international students are a very good supplement in workforce as they could make up the gap between low number of US students and high demand of employers.

Only if industries hire enough people, they could grow up healthily and create more job opportunities, which in turn will benefit US economy and people. If international students lose STEM extension this great opportunity, there would be a huge shortage in workforce, which leads to the result that employers have to rely more on existing employees. Company's growth may slow down, employees will get much more stressed out and finally the whole industry and country is not growing.

Therefore, international students and STEM extension are healthy for US economy and job market. They are not the enemy of American students, instead they are fulfilling what few American students are doing. So I do hope STEM extension could be effective. It would benefit the whole US.
