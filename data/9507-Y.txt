USA is a country founded by immigrants. People from all over the world work together and build the largest economy of the world. Now there is a voice that we should shut new immigrants and kick them out of this country.

USA had better keep these young students with a STEM degree because some of they will grow up to be the leaders of IT, Manufacturing and Research areas. Kicking them out of this country is equivalent to losing valuable human resources. These students with a F1 visa are well educated in US universities and they should be given a chance to work here.

I suggest that the federal government should improve and expand training opportunities for F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.
