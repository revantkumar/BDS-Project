As a potential student, I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The extent opt can appeal more international students. Since most of the STEM students are high educated, they can have a long benefit for the technology industry. Many programs need large amount of time to conceive and test before it can have real contribution to the society, thus the extent opt enables creative ideas to come true. If international students are forced to go back home after one year, they would probably loose their interest in considering coming to American for further education. Without many people who are elites in their own countries coming to USA, I believe the economy and technology would decrease in the long rum.
2. The housing, food, entertainment industry are bound to benefit from the increase in the number of international students. Not only study, international students need time and space to rest and recreate. Many job opportunities can thus be created which not only benefit international students but is good for American citizens as well.
