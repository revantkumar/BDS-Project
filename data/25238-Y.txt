I strongly support this OPT extension rule because it is a win win situation. 
1. This rule is very critical for US education institutes and companies in STEM field. Without the OPT extension, colleges in the US would be much less attractive and competitive to those talented international students. It's certainly not a good thing for the colleges, and it would probably have a negative influence on the community economy too (few renters, few visitors, etc). And the companies would also suffer from the lack of qualified employee candidates. 

2. The extension is also very necessary for the students if we consider the nature of STEM work. Anyone who works in STEM field would know that you need enough time to complete your invention. In most cases, one year is probably too short for you to even finish one project. With the extension, the students can spend more time on their projects, get good-quality work done and make more contribution to the companies or institutes, instead of getting interrupted when their OPT expire and having to leave when they are in the middle of something important. 

3. Nobody can ever STEAL the work from Americans. Just the opposite, the talented international students actually help CREATE more job positions in industry. For example we should know that the international talents have made enormous contribution to the rapid development of the Biotech industry. Quite a lot of them make great inventions when they are in school, and then run their own companies after graduation and start providing jobs for both US citizens and international students. Their efforts should be appreciated.
To sum it up, this policy would benefit hundreds of thousands of people and organizations, not only the international students, but also the US companies, colleges, and Americans in the STEM field. Together we can make the industry more prosperous. It's the way to go.
