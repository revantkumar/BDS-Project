I strongly support OPT extension. It has many benefits for US.

First, I'm doing research in Google. Many of the research projects funded by NSF are 5 years long. If there are only 12 months OPT, those projects will have to be shut down because of lack of hands.

Second, OPT extension is definitely good for US economy. We know that technology companies are the most important increasing points for US economy. And the employee in those companies are mostly foreigners. Canceling OPT extension will influence these companies a lot with no doubt.
