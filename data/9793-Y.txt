I strongly support the claim about improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees. Here are the reasons.

First, recent facts proved that a large amount of efforts had been make to improve US's GDP by US's STEM graduates. They were so innovative, intelligent, highly educative and hard-working on their jobs, which helps a lot in the high-tech prosperity.

Second, typically, the Stem graduates will not affect US citizens' employment rate, because most of the software industries and high tech companies would prefer high-quality personnel, which mostly come from STEM student. It is hard to imaging what the IT industry will look like without the contribution of those talent people.

Therefore, improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees is an helpful way to keep talents and continuously making progresses in US's IT industry.
