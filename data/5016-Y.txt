It is very unfair to extend all kinds of facilities to those in US on f-1 visas, those which are against that goes in 214b.
extension of STEM OPT time and stap gap relief augments Immigrant intent of the student where as many qualified applicants are rejected visas on same ground that given his /her qualification he may take up a career in USA so refused a visa using provisions of 214b.

I strongly urge you to consider providing guidelines for extension of provision of DUAL INTENT to f-1 visa applicants at reputable universities or those which have long been in existence and those with excellent scores or those who pay 1 year tuition in advance like it is for some European countries. 

Please take some action other wise the whole US student visa application process would be a dumb charade.
