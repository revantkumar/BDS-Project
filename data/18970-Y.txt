I strongly SUPPORT the new 24-month OPT STEM extension rule.

1. The 24-month OPT extension period for qualified STEM students provide a reasonable time window for them to get the practical training after their graduation. It is the major reason that international students want to pursue higher education in United State. They want to not only learn the knowledge from the textbooks, but also gain the knowledge through their hand-on training and to learn the most advanced technology and management in the world. The original one year period is way too short to them to get trained and become the qualified engineer/scientist.

2. The diversity of the society is very important. Only by enriching the diversity can this country absorb the essence of various cultures and maintain diverse public voices. And the exchange of ideas and thoughts is good for the U.S. and eventually good for our human beings. Diversity of cultures can also prevent biased or partial collective opinions and behaviors in this country.

3. Also, it is quite noticeable that there are thousands of international students get their jobs at IT company, they are brilliant and have high educational background, but only 50% of them can get H1B visa every year. If the OPT extension is canceled, the rest of these people will have to leave America immediately. This will be a significant loss to American economy.
