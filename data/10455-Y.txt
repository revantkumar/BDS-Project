Dongji Gao I am a second year master in student in University of Pittsburgh and I believe that this policy is beneficial for many aspects of United States for the following reasons.

First of all, the extension of OPT can help domestic consumption which would speed up the increase of GDP. According to NAFSA, international students contributed $26.8 billion to American economy and created and supported over 340,000 career opportunities. Also the extension of OPT would not take away career opportunities from American citizens&residents for there is still a huge need in STEM careers and those Americans lost their jobs are mostly labor-intenive blue collar and veteran who suffer from industrial upgrading and elimination of outdated production capacity. Before I came to America, I have heard that the capacity of high quality people from foreign countries makes American a such successful country in the world.

In addition, many many STEM related jobs involves with scientific research. So during which companies must pay much money and time to help their employees to get familiar with their work as well as the demand of market. If there's no enough time provided by OPT, those program would face the risk of losing important members which would definitely brings negative effect to companies.

What is more, international students also prove cultural diversity of universities and colleges, students under such environment would keep a better cultural tolerance and more broad horizon.
It can also develop scientific competitive strength. International students are a major part of EE, CS and ME. Most universities and colleges need to keep their competitive strength by attracting those international students.

Based on the reasons listed above, I strong agree with the new OPT extension policy.
