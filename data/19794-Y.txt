I strongly support this proposed rule regarding stem degree opt extension and cap gap relief with pending h1b.

First of all, I don't know where some people got the information considering foreign students who entered U.S. legally as illegals. There is a huge difference. Foreign students who come to the U.S. get inspections from customs at the airport and pay a significant amount of money for their education because they don't qualify for in-state tuition fee regardless how many years they have been in the U.S. Foreign students have already made great contribution to U.S. education and economy. 

Secondly, there are less opportunities than you think for the foreign students. Opt extension will help foreign students in great ways but a lot of the companies still won't consider hiring foreign students because hiring them means you will have to sponsor working visas in order to keep them a longer term. The employers will still pick natives over foreigners because there are less things to worry about when it comes to legal working status. Not a lot of the employers are willing to hire an average foreign student who can only stay in the U.S. for a limited period of time. Only those foreign students who are exceptional and outstanding will get the opportunity to gain working visa sponsorships from those employers who are willing to go through this trouble. And I believe those outstanding foreign students will continue making huge contribution to the U.S. 

At last, I want to thank those foreign students who made or continue making contributions to our society.
