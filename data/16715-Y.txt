International students who can work in USA within OPT period actually improve the development of economy of USA, and it results in producing more and more working vacancies in American. So those people who said "foreign persons making them struggle in the job market competition" are completely wrong, instead, people majored in STEM field help US citizens get more working opportunities, and also help American grow much faster! 
So I strongly support proposal of improving and Expanding the OPT for STEM students.
