Yi Li I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I was an international computer science master student from China and I'm a software engineer at Microsoft. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Hong Kong and Australia. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. The OPT extension is clearly very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I don't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. Further more, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies, like Google, Apple, Intel, Microsoft, etc. Because they are supported by foreign STEM talents who take the benefits from the OPT extension. 

I believe that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for the OPT program. Based on my work experience at Microsoft, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers worked on those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.

The OPT extension program is only available to those employers who are e-verified, preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. STEM students in the OPT extension program also pay taxes and social security as normal citizens. It's not fair to claim that OPT extension program harm the interest of citizens in job market.
