I support the OPT extension 100%! I found some U.S. citizens immediately reject the extension even before they understand it. Here's one simple example I found: 

"Living in San Diego and have an 18 yo son who still cannot find an entry level job anywhere. he has even applied to fast food chains despite feeling uncomfortable working there because he was the only non-hispanic english -speaking youth. Now looking for over 13 months. As a result of the constant rejection he has become quit hopeless and depressed. He is a good kid with morals, polite, well-spoken, integrity, clean-cut, and with good grades. He is giving up because he just does not know what to do anymore to get a break."

I just want to say your 18 year-old son couldn't find a job almost has nothing to do with international students who need OPT extension. They are the students graduating from STEM and working for high-tech companies basically. Actually I think you should not blame the students who need OPT extension but all those Mexican illegals.
