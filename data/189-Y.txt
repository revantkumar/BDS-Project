We should support this proposal. We invested our education system for STEM majors to have enough work force. If allowing the STEM graduates work longer equals waste of the investment on education. To maximize the investment, no immigrants with STEM majors should allowed to work in this country longer and to encourage more people to choose these majors. This great proposal should be a positive signal showing how the whole society respect the STEM major talants. We can't protect our kids from doing physics or math problems. Their brain should be trained and they should get ready for the challenges from Europe and Asia.
