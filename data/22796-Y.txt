I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

I am a graduate student from Mechanical Engineering focusing on vehicle emission measurement. In my field, there is very few American students who are interested looking for a related job. In my research lab, American students are interested hunting a job related to electric car or defense industry. Companies in US, especially traditional car industry are looking for candidates who are interested and having the skill sets about emission measurement for engine development and research. In my area, international students are not taking American people's job but rather contributing to a specific emission measurement field.

In a conclusion, I strongly support the proposal for following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

2. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International student are only taking working position that companies cannot find proper American people with the skill sets.
