Yue Deng I feel like there is a lot of misinformation in the comments with regard to this proposed rule. So I would like to correct some and explaining why I think we should support this rule.

First of all, this regulation does not take jobs away from qualified Americans. Based on my experience as a graduating Chemical Engineering student, I can clearly tell that companies have a strong preference for domestic talent due to visa issue, culture mismatches, and etc. A qualified American worker will always win over a foreign worker.

Secondly,in my department, every year we have over 150 applicants from international and around 100 applicants from domestic citizen, while we have around 10 international students and over 50 American students in the end. This tells us that international students are much harder to get accepted. Those selected students should be very talented at their field.

So international workers are not taking American jobs. But why this rule would be good to American society? Because America needs these talents. In academic field, a lot of great achievements were done by foreign students and faculties. They should have the chance to continue their research and contribute. When students are already trained well and received the highest education from America, why kick them out instead of letting them contribute more?

PLEASE allow this rule to take effect. This rule is a very important step forward to improving immigration and improving the US economy.
