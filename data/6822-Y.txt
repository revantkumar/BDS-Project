What keeps attracting people from all over the world to come to the U.S. is the American belief that all people are created equal and should have freedom to pursue their happiness regardless of their gender, race and religion. United States is a country build by immigrants. If you are not a Native American, your family must come from somewhere else some time ago. It's sad to see that some American citizens often forget this important foundation of our nation and try to prevent immigration reform. Without immigrants, especially the highly educated skilled workers, the U.S won't see the birth of so many technological innovation and successful global corporations. We should keep America innovative and competitive by attracting smart and hardworking immigrants. Thus, extending the OPT period for STEM majors is a great first step. I look forward to seeing more immigration reform policies like this.
