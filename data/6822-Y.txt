Tan Cheng, CNH Industrial I am just graduated from school and currently in my first year of OPT. I support to extend stem-OPT period for the following reasons.

From personal aspect, I am a new employee in CNH Industrial. I was shocked when I heard that the stem extension is denied a couple months ago. Since I am afraid to be one of the sacrifices of the rule cancellation. As we know, getting a H1b visa becomes more and more difficult these years, and there is no guarantee that an OPT student can get H1b in his first year of career. Therefore if I am not allow to extend my OPT, I will be likely to lose my job if I cannot get h1b visa next year. And this is just so risky I think

From company aspect, they hire international students and in many cases these students are regarded as long-term employees. However, if they have to leave to country after one year's OPT, that will be a great lost for the company because these students have been trained for one year and they are already enrolled in their projects. 

The negative thing will be that those high tech companies will be very hesitate to hire any international student even through the student is very competitive. Because no one wants to take the risk of losing employee if no OPT extension is allowed for stem student. I don't think this is fair, neither is good for the country. Potentially the rule of equality hiring is threatened, which may cause further social problems.

Above all, I highly encourage to extend the stem-OPT period. I would like to see those new international employees have the same right to stay in the company as other people. They work so hard, they should get bigger chance to continue their career. I believe the rule of 24 months stem-OPT extension will benefit the society and the county eventually.
