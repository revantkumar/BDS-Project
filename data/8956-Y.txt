Matthew Roderick The proposed rule from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Practical Training program would be a detriment to American tech workers, especially recent college graduates. The program would allow U.S. companies to hire foreign citizens who have been pursuing a degree for at least nine months in the U.S., artificially expanding the pool of available workers for jobs particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. As a result, this would put downward pressure on wages for all tech workers. Furthermore, the program actually incentivizes employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.

As a veteran of the technology industry, I can tell you that the H-1B visa is abused in many ways by both the companies that issue them to the visa holders themselves. The expansion of the OPT program will open up another avenue to cheat the immigration system while disenfranchising American workers who are typically more qualified than their Indian counterparts.
