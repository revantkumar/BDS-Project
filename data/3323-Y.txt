Shuhao Lin I strongly SUPPORT this rule for the following reasons:

1. F-1 students are making very huge contributions to U.S country. 

2. F1-students have very little responsibility for the current salary level in software and Internet industry. 

3. STEM area is somewhere that not top one choice for American. F-1 student who study in the STEM area help U.S fill the gap that shortage in those areas.

4. Diversity is key in U.S. F-1 student can help promote diversity in U.S culture.

Overall, I strongly agree this rule.
