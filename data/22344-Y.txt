Before those worldwide elites coming to US, there still existed people who could not find jobs. I have checked the unemployment rate from 1990 to 2013, 
1990, 5.6. 1991, 6.8. 1992, 7.5. 1993, 6.9. 1994, 6.1. 1995, 5.6. 1996, 5.4. 1997, 4.9 ... 2007, 4.6. 2008, 5.8. 2009, 9.3. 2010, 9.6. 2011, 8.9. 2012, 8.1. 2013, 7.4, which means those foreigners were not the ones that stolen Americans' jobs. It was the bad economy! 
This extension is just for small amount of foreigners, much less than one month nonfarm employment position. So in fact it doesn't affect Americans' job market at all. If you guys want to retrieve jobs from so-called foreigners, you should requires all the US international companies come back from other countries, because considerable job positions have been sold out by these international companies. 
After all, these skilled foreigners are not intend to ruin Americans' lives, they actually also serves as the contributors to US society. No one need others to feed, and themselves make this county much better.
