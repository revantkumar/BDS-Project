I am opposed to expanding the OTP. It is high time we began hiring American students, graduates and young professionals who are unemployed or underemployed right here on our soil. This is nothing more than another avenue for big corps to save on salaries (7-10%) thus fattening their bottom line. While I am all for making a profit, the savings are minor when compared to the ethical and logical choice of hiring these professionals from a pool of qualified AMERICANS. Lastly, expanding programs like these only works to discourage young students from pursuing these careers - a double edge sword if I ever saw one. Thank you.
