I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. The students can contributions to the income tax in the States. If the proposal is denied, government will lose thousands of foreign students each year.
