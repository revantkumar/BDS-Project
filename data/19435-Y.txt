The new regulations should be totally agreed with in many ways. We should make it clear that the education is no more a service in one country, but also a service globally. There shouldn't be any restriction on the education, because the education in the US is just like the flow of information and money, which flows internationally. While the new rules from DHS is a great way to help the academic sector in US to maintain competitive among the other countries. And the opt extension is one of the biggest advantage over the other countries as a result. 

Countries like Canada, UK, Australia, Singapore are making attractive strategies to maintain a high percentage of international students in the global world. They know this clearly that the international students will be one of the most important powers to drive the economies in their country. If the opt is only 12 months for the international students, it will be a HUGE loss for not only the education institutions in US, and also the house owners locally, superstores, restaurants, bookstores and even medical centers around the schools. If the opt extension is no longer valid, the attractiveness for the international students would be weak in the US and that would be really huge loss for the education sector in US, but also the loss for the economy locally.
