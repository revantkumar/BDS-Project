Although I am not in the STEM program;still I strongly support the extension of the recent proposal of 24 months extension. I believe this proposal of improving and expanding training opportunities for STEM students up to 24 months is a great initiative and it will be helpful for the students and for the US economy as well. Thus I strongly support and believe this one will get approved.
