Tim Huisman Get rid of the DHS. Government overreach and a waste of focus toward foreigners befitting from US higher learning institutions. The same institutions that are not only hotbed or bastions of liberal policies run amok, but limited to only those who haven't been victimized by poisonous liberal secondary school policies and can't test into good four year universities.
Evil only exists when good men stand by & do nothing.
