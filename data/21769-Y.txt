I strongly support this proposal. It greatly helps the nation's colleges remain competitive globally, including attracting foreign STEM students to study in the U.S.
Since it requires terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity, including duties, hours and compensation to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers, I think it's a safeguard for U.S. workers. It's American spirit that everyone should have equal right to work in U.S.
