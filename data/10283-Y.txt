Danny Han The new rule should be strongly supported. This plan is actually standing on a higher level, aiming at improving US education competitiveness in the world. Therefore, US higher education institutions are one of the biggest beneficiaries. 
As an international student, I have so many choices for my master program, Universities in Canada, UK, Germany, France, Singapore, etc. are all among the top rank. One most critical reason that I choose US education is the STEM rule which provides international students a platform to put what they've learned at school into practice in order to become more experienced in the related field. Please see that once the STEM plan is rejected, US will lose a big part of excellent international students in the educational competition with other countries. And this impact may not only affect US educational department, but also the employers in the STEM fields.
In sum, the new STEM rule enhances fair competition and consolidates US educational institutions' world leading position.
