I support this rule and I am a graduate in mechanical engineering. 

a) Participate in OPT is beneficial for the OPT students.
It is beneficial for students to participated in practical projects to apply their knowledge and develop a deeper understanding of their field of study. OPT is one of the key consideration for us to choose the United States for our study. 

b) Many research projects in OPT take years to complete. 
For example, in my area of mechanical engineering, it is typical to involve building hardware systems. It takes a long time for manufacturing, assembling and testing. My current project involves cooperation with Federal Highway Administration and has a three year duration and involves hardware system development. This duration is also very typical for other grant projects. 

c) U.S. employers will benefit from the OPT students. 
As what I observed from my workplace, OPT students are highly motivated and are always eager to contribute to the employers. Keep recruiting new employees also increase the possibility of bringing innovation to the employers.

d) The existence of OPT will not make it difficult for U.S. citizens to get jobs
For one thing, only employers in the E-Verify program are capable of recruiting OPT students. These employers will not have discrimination on recruiting which means it is equal for any potential employee, no matter the race or nationality. For the other thing, as what I know, some companies recruits OPT students as temporary contract instead of a full employee. This distinguish these students from other employees. When the contract ends, OPT students will leave the company and probably go back to their home countries.
