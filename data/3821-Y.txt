I strongly SUPPORT this policy!

The policy will encourage more international students to come to U.S. and thus benefit the growth of U.S. economy.

The policy will help the IT industry grow faster. In fact, there are many positions in the demanding fields need to be filled by international students. For example, I graduated from a data analytics program, and there were 76% international students in my class. If very few native students are interested in these fields, then how can IT companies find the right talents without recruiting international students?
