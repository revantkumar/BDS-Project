Common Sense I strongly SUPPORT this proposal

There are thousands of employees who are using OPT to work on their technical positions. Due to special knowledge background and experience are required in these positions, there is absolutely no enough native people to make up these positions if a large amount of people are forced to stop working at the same time due to the end of OPT extension. In this case, almost all IT companies will be affected. The productivity will severely reduced, which may also cause another economic recession.

At the same time, should the OPT extension is canceled, the attraction of American universities to international students will also reduce. Nowadays, the best students in the world are inclined to attend American schools instead of British universities, one important reason is because the United States provide students with a smooth transition from students to their career life. People can gain two or three years of working experience after they get exposed to the best education in the world, and it is a lot easier for them to path into a good career route after they return to their own country.

OPT extension creates a win-win situation since those people who are gaining working experience are also paying tax, making good progress to US companies. That's why I think proposal for NONIMMIGRANT students offer benefits for both sides.
