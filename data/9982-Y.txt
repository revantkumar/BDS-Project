I think the rule is good for both STEM students and America.

International students with good education background and high academic performance is making America better off instead of getting worse, from industry to academic. 

Compared the 8million unemployed people in US, the number of STEM students is nothing at all, not to mention stealing jobs from native Americans. 

Compared to the total number of openings from industry to academic, even 100% STEM students get employed will still leave a huge number of opennings, not to mention only <20%(if lucky) STEM students will finally get working Visa from lottery and stay here.
