I would say that the OPT extension is only for the STEM international students. We should be aware of several facts here: 1. The percentage of the local US students and the unemployed US citizen of STEM is obviously much lower than the other fields. This means that even if we do not provide the OPT extension to those international students, It's not going to help anyway. Those unemployed US citizen or new graduates are competing much more with each other instead of with those international students. 2 Oppositely, If we do not extend the OPT which means there will be much less students working for the high tech companies (most of them they are US companies) at any point of time. Someone may argue that the H1-B are the same and it's nothing to do with the OPT, but you should also be aware of that if OPT is more 36 months which means even if he/she can not get an H1-B eventually, he/she can still work for those US companies for about 3 years which lead an optimized 3 times more students than what it is without the OPT extend. This will also do good to the US economy and then to other industries which are exactly what the US citizens and fresh graduates are looking for.
In a word, the OPT extension is good for both the US government, the US citizens and the international students.
