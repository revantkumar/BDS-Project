I oppose the Obama Administration's extension of OPT which allows foreing students to overstay (by up to three yrs) the requirement to vacate the USA within 60 days of their graduation or completion of course of study. Further, they are not allowed to have a job. Allowing them to illegally overstay and illegally hold a job takes opportunities away from US Citizens with STEM credentials from getting those jobs.
