Yifu Liu I strongly agree with the decision of OPT extension to 2 years. Some people argued that nonimmigrant students would take positions and many would stay in US. But the fact is, the chance to get a H1B visa is no big difference due to increased applying number in spite of the time extension. Besides, they are less costly than US citizens, and with specialized skill typically produce much more profits for numerous companies. 

A lot of nonimmigrant students work through a contract company instead of direct hire, which means they have much less benefits than a US citizen employee. When the economy of nation drops suddenly, it's also these students who would lose jobs first without a guarantee. So the Americans should be glad with what F1 students contribute to this country at a low cost.

Besides, STEM are fields where US need technician urgently. The extension will meet the demands of American industry and increase the competence of US in global market.
