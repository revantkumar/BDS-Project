This proposal is a step in the right direction. 
Because of the current 17-month limit to the STEM extension, international employees have to abruptly terminate their employment. This halts the employee's growth, and also puts unnecessary burden on the company, which loses a valuable employee that they have invested in for months. By expanding the extension to cover 24 months, the employee gets more time to apply their education and gain valuable experience, and the employer gets a another chance to apply for an H1B or another visa if they want to retain the employee. Because of the very competitive H1B selection process, that another chance is invaluable.
