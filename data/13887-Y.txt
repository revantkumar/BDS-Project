American economy highly depends on high-tech companies, which employee tremendous international students. These international students contribute huge GDP and taxes to America during OPT extension. However, OPT extension does not impact the employments of native Americans. Because, absolutely, priority will be given to native Americans with qualification when employers hire new employees. American high-tech companies hired so many international students, which demonstrated there are not enough native Americans who would like to be engaged in the high-tech industry or are eligible for these high-tech positions. If OPT extension for STEM Degrees would not exist any more, these high-tech companies could not employ enough eligible people after one year OPT. It would damage American economy severely, even be an irreversible economic crisis for America. At the same time, if OPT extension for STEM Degrees would not exist any more, it would be tremendous waste for American Higher Education resources. One year OPT is apparently not enough for STEM Degrees international students contributing to America. That is why America needs OPT extension.
