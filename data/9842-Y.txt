This is good news not only for students with STEM degrees but also for the related industries and markets.

From the international students perspective, the new rule will attract more students coming to US and pursuing high-quality education and degrees.

For those universities, these strictly picked talents make incredible contributions to the fundamental researches and ideas in STEM areas, which indeed are the engines of industries like IT, biotech, semiconductor and even Wall street. Besides universities as a result afford more faculties and scholarships with more tuitions collected from international students. Note that tuition for international students are nearly doubled compared to US students in public schools. So the taxpayers enjoy benefit at least from the higher education.

Some people questioned that bringing more international students means less job opportunities for natives. This is not true. In fact, for the last few years, the number of international students hits the record, but the unemployment rate was lowest since 2008! Take IT giants for example, they provide more and more job opportunities because of more IP's from STEM researches and inventions. More than often, the whole chain starting from manufacturing to the end consumers creates more jobs besides those in IT companies themselves!

In a conclusion, it is for sure that improving and expanding the current STEM OPT rule will be a win-win.
