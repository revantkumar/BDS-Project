Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, 80 Fed. Reg. 63376 (October 19, 2015).

We need to make sure this rule is implemented so the U.S. can benefit from the skills and talents that international students who have earned STEM degrees from U.S. universities have to offer to individual American businesses, as well as to the U.S. economy.

The STEM OPT extension is a very valuable program and its continued usage will not only help our business, but help generate economic growth and job creation for the our communities. I look forward to seeing this rule finalized.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on this new rule.

Sincerely,

Michael Damico 19 Middle Dunstable Nashua, NH 03062
