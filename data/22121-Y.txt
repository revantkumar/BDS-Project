I support this proposal. 

The United States is a democratic, free, open-minded country. However, why there exists many people fight against this proposal in improper and immoral way?

See, this is a website provide samples comments and negative reviews on this proposal. I don't think it's a wise way to influence the decision and proposal. This behavior is not conducive to progress and economic development of the country and hinder social progress. 

This kind of behavior ashamed me, ashamed the US.
