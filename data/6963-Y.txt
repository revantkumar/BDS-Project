Xinrui Huang This proposal is very good. I like it. I strongly recommend this to be proved for following reasons:

1). Although there might be some language barry between international students and local people, International students works hard and are able to fight against deep pressure. Local employers in some fields prefer hard-working employees.

2). The immigration of international students will extend the shopping market on landing apartments, everyday goods and so on, which will provide more opportunities on the industries. International students are not only competing with local job-hunters, we are also extending the market and providing more job opportunities.

3). International students have advantages and disavantages on their personatilies, abilities and cultures compared to local students. In my opinion, it is more refreshing to work with people from different culture than a same culture.

Last). There should be no difference between treating Americans and nonimmigrant students in this free country.
