Dear Sir or Madam,

Thank you for this proposal which want to extend the OPT time. I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1, More time means more competition. All knowledgable people know the benefits of the competition. It will let students work hard and find ways to innovate. This may be a bad thing for the natural born American who do not work hard and also want to get the high-paid job, but competition will help most of American students to study better and finally benefits America.

2, More time means more understanding. It is really common that the people who do not know any foreigners hate other countries and foreigners. It is the result of fear to something that is unknown. We need more time to know each others in the world, especially to the youth who are the future to any country. After they have more foreign classmates, colleagues and friends, they will have more concrete impression to other country. We live in the same world, we need understand each other.

3, more time means more cooperation. Nowadays, any country can not live well with others. Anyone have its own advantage and shortage. If we can learn from each other, share the skills with each other, cooperate with each other, others' advantage will also be ours. All of us will get better during this procedure.

From the above points at least, I really support the proposal which want us to have more competition, more understanding and more cooperations.

Thank you!
