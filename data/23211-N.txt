When is our government going to work for the people that pay the taxes? My daughter is in charge of a non-resident alien tax program at a university....the money spent on these programs is astronomical. My idea of government is one that benefits its citizens that not that of special interests that press for these programs. American business needs to start saving America from destruction by using American workers and not looking outside the country for those that will work for lower pay thus increasing pay for the top echelon. Does the American government listen to their citizens...my answer is a resounding no...they do what they want and are not affected by the consequences.
