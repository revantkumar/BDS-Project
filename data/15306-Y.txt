I strongly support this proposed rule for the following reasons.

First of all, international students have professional knowledge and skill after they obtain degrees from the universities in US. As far as I know, most international students are from top universities in their countries. So they can contribute to the improvement of sentence and economy.

Secondly, more international employees can enhance the developments of American companies. They will enjoy from more cultures from all around the world. Also, it is good for their oversea business.

The most important thing is, America is always welcoming people from all around the world. Their ancestors came to this land with the American dream. This is what America means. This is how they built this country. More immigrants with higher education and better morality will make this country much stronger and more powerful.
