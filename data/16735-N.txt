Our students are being educated in STEM fields so that they can hopefully find a job when they graduate from college (after paying huge tuition fees!) Instead of rewarding them with jobs, the Optional Practical Training program from the Dept of Homeland Security would give these jobs to foreign students - and the program actually incentives employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay employer payroll taxes or a prevailing wage

Immigration policy should serve in the interests of American workers, not against it.
