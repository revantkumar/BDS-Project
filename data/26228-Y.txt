I strongly support the proposal for OPT extension and Cap-Gap relief. Here are the reasons:
1. Foreign students graduated from US universities have made great contribution to US. Here are a few examples, Ajay Bhatt, Chief Client Platform Architect at Intel, had his Masters degree in The City University of New York before joining intel; Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, had his M.S. degree in Computer Science at the University of WisconsinMilwaukee and MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business; Vinod Dham, the father of the famous Intel Pentium processor, gained a masters degree in electrical engineering at the University of Cincinnati. All three people were foreign immigrants. The OPT extension and Cap-Gap relief will enable people with great talent to work in US after they graduate. 
2. The OPT extension grants STEM students to work in US before they get their H1B visa. STEM students with higher degrees generally works on high-tech companies with high income. Take the success of silicon valley as an example, which contribute huge amount to the US economy. Companies in silicon valley hire a lot of international graduates each year, because they can't find enough US students to do the work. If the OPT extension is void, those companies cannot hire enough people and it will be a hard blow to the economy.
3. Jobless people in US are generally not well-educated and are looking for blue collar jobs. The STEM students don't compete with them.
4. Historically, the success of US greatly relies on successful immigration policies. During and after world war II, the crowd of well-educated immigrants have boosted the US economy and the development of science and technology. If the OPT extension is void. it will be a great set back.
