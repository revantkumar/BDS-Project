Strongly support STEM OPT extension new rules. An engineering lifecycle for a product spans from 2-5 years. Hiring an OPT engineer with 1 year permit is useless as it is not adequate amount of time for him/her to rampup on the job and continue to contribute to product. So, with out STEP OPT extension, OPT as such is not going to help a lot either for the student or the employer or american society. 

Regarding whether OPT program and its effect on american job market, surely one have to give priority to american people but if there isn not enough work force, what would we have to do? Just train with best possible education in USA and send the engineers to other countries? That does not make sense unless one view's education as economic perspective rather than social impact. 

Anyways, its upto congress and the government to decide whether OPT makes sensse or not, but having STEM OPT extension for 2 years is definitely required.
