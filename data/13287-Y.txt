I strongly SUPPORT this proposal, it will help keep young talents to stay in US. 24-month STEM extension enabled employers to apply for H1B visa for up to 3 times. Global leading companies would like to spend that effort to keep the talented people.That's the way to stay their creativity. Stopping this program will have severely negative impact on this. 

Concerns like international students taking the chances from citizens are over estimated. Generally, US natives have great advantages over international students in job market. If you look at careers fairs holding in my school, UTexas, 62% employers (document attached) only consider US citizen or PR, they do not want to spend money to work visa. For the rest 38% employers, they only consider international students when they have to. Their need for talents are serious, blocking talented international students does not mean they would lower their expectation to let less talented people in.

I think STEM extension will help companies serious enough about hiring talents to keep elite talents. Native students should not concern too much about this proposal in general. Their working opportunity won't be compromised.
