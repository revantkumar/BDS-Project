The new 24-month extension rule will make a big positive influence on the economy of the United States. The new rule will encourage more foreign elite students to come to the country study and make a contribution to the economy after their graduation. Since there are getting more and more H1B applications each year, the chances for foreign students to stay legally is getting smaller. The country needs these elite working people.

This new rule should be applied to all the eligible students who are/will be in the process of applying OPT extension. This new rule should take affect on/before Feb 2/12/2016.
