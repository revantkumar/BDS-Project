I am a HUGE SUPPORTER of STEM extension.

United States is the most powerful country because it takes the best of all that GOD has given to the world. Each year foreign students and scholars visit US for education and conference. A great nation should always keep open to those talents, especially for those technical engineers workers (with a so-called STEM degrees). 

Diversity keeps our society dynamic and creative. America is an immigrant country and talented immigrants make America flourishing and powerful.

I saw some comments which are over addressing the privilege of citizenship. No discrimination on immigrants! Most of American have a immigrant ancestor, including those guys who left terrible comments.
