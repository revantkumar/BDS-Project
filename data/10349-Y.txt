I stronglly support OPT 24 month extension, the reasons are followling:
1. The U.S needs the international students in the STEM fields. U.S does not have enough young people interested in STEM, without OPT extension, almost all STEM related companies would face an alkward situation that no qualified employee are there available.

2. The international students is an unlimited source of cheap labor for the U.S. companies. None of the employers would like to pay the high salary to a U.S citizens when there is a cheap labor available.

3. The international students would benefit many other industries, such as tourism, real estate and retail business, by attracting families and friends to the U.S. The loss from these fields would be substantial if we shorten the OPT time.

The foreign labor has became an important part in the U.S economy in terms of producers and consumers. The U.S. need more and more international students and longer OPT time.
