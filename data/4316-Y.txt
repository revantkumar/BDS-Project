Samiha Fnu I fully support the proposed rule. And as for people concerned about losing STEM jobs to international students, jobs are more plentiful in STEM fields, which is why the unemployment rates are low for grads with these degrees. According to the Conference Board, there are currently three job vacancies advertised online for every unemployed computer worker; by contrast, there are more than six unemployed construction workers per vacancy.
By 2018, there could be 2.4 million unfilled STEM jobs. While jobs overall are expected to grow just shy of 10 percent by 2018, STEM jobs are predicted to grow by 17 percent. More than half of this growth will be made up of computer careers, and more than a quarter will be engineers and technicians. Life/physical scientists, architects and surveyors, and mathematical sciences make up the remainder.
U.S. colleges are only graduating enough computer science engineers to fill 30 percent of STEM jobs by 2020. While lack of U.S. STEM graduates is undoubtedly a contributing factor to the STEM gap, another cause may surprise you.
The single-most responsible factor in the STEM skills gap is that employees with STEM skills are highly sought-after in all fields. Just ten percent of students who earn a Bachelors Degree within a STEM major actually go on to work in STEM after college. Fast-forward ten years and that number drops to just eight percent.

So, the efforts of many civic-minded people to boost STEM attainment nationwide especially among underrepresented black, Latino and female students reflect a rational and humane response to economic reality. Those efforts should be applauded, not undermined.
