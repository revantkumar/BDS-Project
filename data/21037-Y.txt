I am a F-1 PhD student in Engineering. I am very support to expanding training opportunities for F-1 students to 24 months. In that way, we will have three years to improve our skills. Actually many of PhD students in our field want to do postdoctoral research in universities or national labs, and they may want postdocs can spend more time on the project, so if we can get 24 months extension, then we can know more and accomplished more projects during our postdoctoral experience. .
