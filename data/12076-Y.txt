The Act should be passed without any hesitation. It's beneficial for nobody but the United States of America. The US government should act all its best to secure its ability to attract and retain talents at all times, which is harder and harder nowadays because the world has changed. The United States of America is founded by talented immigrants from all over the world. Talents in the science and technology field are especially valuable - they are the working forces and foundations for the US high-tech industries. The US is leading these industries, and the last thing you want to see is losing talents to competitors. The large number of foreign STEM graduates being hired is a sign of promise for the future of the US, rather than a curse. They are hired for many reasons, including the lack of high quality candidates from the domestic market. The foreign STEM graduates face much more restrictions and limitations in finding jobs than a regular US citizen. There's no ground to blame them for stealing US jobs. Instead, they are creating many other non-tech jobs for the US citizens like those in the sales and marketing domains. Therefore, the Act is one of the most correct decisions among many unwise choices the US government has made.
