I'm a international student studying in Texas. I support the OPT extension simply because I've been always trying hard, students like me are deserved a fair opportunity in job market. As a international student, job finding is too difficult to imagine. Most of the students choose to leave, but the rest try so hard because they want a better opputinity to work, and some of them need the job for their family. My boyfriend, he was a civil engineering majoy master student. You can't imagine how many jobs he had applied when he was seeking jobs, 834!! He worked so hard to get a good one. But end up with failure in H1B lottery. Everyone in his company like him because he is a excellent employee and coworker. The boss feels so sorry for him but can't do anything. I've known many awesome people like him, they do a great job but struggle with the working permit problem. OPT extension can't grantee anything, like H1B, green card.. BUT it makes a progress that the policy doesn't close the door on brilliant people.
