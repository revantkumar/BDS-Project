I came to US at the age of 15 and I have been in the US ever since. Studying, working and making friends. I have graduated from UC Berkeley May 2014 with mayor in Computer Science, and have been working since then at different tech companies. H1B has been a huge concern on my mind, since the chances of getting it is so low and going back to my home country would mean dramatic change.

With the current system, I would only have 1 more chance at the lottery and most likely leave the country in December 2016. Going back to China would be a huge hit to my career. Adding the 7 new month would be really great as it would give me another chance at the lottery and prolong my career here in the US.
