I think it is very good, since US government and universities speed so much money on PhD every year, for research, for education, just let the students go back their native country will let US get no profit from this.

And let the international students work in US, the US will get profits and the students will get good job experience, so it is good for both sides.

Let the good students work in US is also good for US, human resource is the best resource.
