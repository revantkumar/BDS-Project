The OPT is just another horrible addendum to a terrible immigration policy. This is further proof that our government is more dangerous to its citizens than ISIS, Al Qaeda, or any other terrorist faction you might name. If this is not defeated we may suspect that outright revolution may be the only future we can look forward to. There is just only so much that we, in the middle class, can tolerate before serious reactions occur. Our nation is in peril.
