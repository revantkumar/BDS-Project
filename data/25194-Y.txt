I strongly support this rule. First of all, expanding the extension time is good to the company as well as the employees (both STEM students and American employers). Take myself as an example, I am involved in a big project right now. This project took me more than 1 year to understand the whole process and all the details. Without the STEM extension rule, I will have to give up this project and leave it to a green hand. The new person also need 1 year to learn and familiarize with this big project, and other 4 people (they are all American) in this project have to waste time to teach and coordinate with new person and this precious time could be saved. And my company have to suffer the delay of the project and might now deliver it to our customer. So all of the chain will be affected and no good to anyone. Secondly, when I choose to study abroad, US is only one of the choice, the reason why I finally choose US is the advantage of STEM extension, it provides more opportunity for STEM students to find a job and accumulate experience. Without STEM extension, UK should be a better destination, due to their shorter learning time.
