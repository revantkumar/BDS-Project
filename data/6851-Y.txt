Leeyoung Lee I strongly support this proposal.

I am current a student under OPT and work in a consulting company. I lost in the H1B lottery last time and looking forward a good luck for next time. My manager is worry about my case. Because she don't know whether she need to recruit a new employee or not. She definitely prefer me to stay, because I am more experienced. It will take her another year to train a new employee to familiar with the job. We talked about my promotion, but every changes because the revoke of OPT extension last month. It is a disaster. So, I definitely support this proposal for the good of myself and my company. 

Your favorable consideration will be greatly appreciated.
