94 million Americans out of the workforce, our millennial generation the best educated & least paid & we need to expand programs to train MORE foreign workers to displace even more hard working Americans?

Like broken records, billionaires and mega-corporations keep telling us they need more foreign tech workers as they lay off thousands of Americans. 

Unsuccessful in their efforts to have Congress expand the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas, Big Tech lobbyists have come up with a plan to circumvent the limit by expanding the Optional Practical Training Program (OPT). Here's more:

Initially, the OPT program allowed foreign students to work in the U.S. for one year on their F-1 student visas.
The G.W. Bush administration then added a 17-month extension for foreign students in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.
Now the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed to increase the extension to 24 months, which means that foreign students are also receiving a 3-year work visa. DHS tried to implement the OPT expansion without going through the notice-and-comment period, and only a lawsuit by the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) led to a new regulation allowing public comment.
