I see someone saying Disney is replacing their staff with foreigners. It does not have anything to do with STEM! Most people objecting this proposal are just throwing tantrum from their unemployment. Technical immigrants have to do a lot of work to have the right a 'Natural American' is born with. The reason that US high tech industry can have such achievement, is because there are so many people working so hard and doing extra work to pursue something you are born with. Decent Americans would know the doorway for LEGAL immigrants is very narrow and will not affect what they have. Foreign STEM students are not ILLEGAL cheap immigrants that will work for a low salary and take your job. 
You will not have the greatest dog trainer Ceasar Millan if you kill the chance for every immigrants. That's why we should provide the opportunity for American STEM industries to hire talents from all over the world. America is a great country because it is where all men are born equal, and hard work pays off. That is why it can attract the most talented people from all over the world to serve it. Think about how much talented people who had the potential to serve the country will put their talent in other country if this proposal is denied because of someone who don't even know what STEM is.
