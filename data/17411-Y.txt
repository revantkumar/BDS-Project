This is definitely an improvement for American immigration policies and it is also a very good news for all STEM students if the new regulation can be improved. America is an migration country and we can see the contributions that all the immigrants did which bring America to such a strong country in the world. A lot of the students who have received best education from America schools and they want to stay in the country that they love and they want to make contributions to the country, there is no way we should stop them. Those people who think these students will take their jobs and may lower their pay rate, for some situation, it may true, but this is the motivation to let the country move forward. We can see all these students who want to stay in this country they are making more effort than native people. Because they need go through a lot extra steps to get a job. They need to improve that they are much better than other people to fit in the job, because a lot companies do not want to hire international students since they will pay for immigration documents and take more risks. It makes sense that people want to stay in the comfort zone, but stay in one place and enjoy what they get which can make people lazy and one day they will spend all they got, at that time it will be too late. So we should keep this immigration rules move forward to give the students more chance to make contributions to the country that they like and we should keep more fresh water flowing into United States to make the country better.
