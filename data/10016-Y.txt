I strongly support the stem opt extension. This is a perfect way to increase the diversity culture. It is very meaningful for U.S to keep the hi-tech talents. The payment for h1b worker is very reasonable. The stem students are always working hard and intelligent student. They should be kept in U.S. To benefit and contribute U.S. society. It will boost the U.S. Economy. Undoubtedly, opt extension should be approved for the wellbeing of U.S. economy
