I totally agree with the expanding. I will describe my reasons as following.
First, the contribution to the United States. Comparing with other developed countries, the United States has a much more energetic economic environment. How come? The birth rate of US is lower than the average rate of the whole world, labor shortage should happen but it doesn't. How come? The answer is new blood. New immigrations with high education contribute to the country. Especially the STEM students, who are educated in US, can go to work in a high tech position immediately after graduation with OPT. Without OPT expanding, a shortage of high educated workers will happen in the near future and technology development will be inhibited.
Second, without OPT expanding, Studing aboard in US will lost its attraction. US is an immigration country and famous for its opening to new arrivals. That is why US is one of the best choice for graduate students. No OPT expanding will reflect the government attitude to new comers, "you are not welcome anymore". In this case, potential students will choose other countries, like Australia, Canada and Europe. Number of Foreign visitors will reduce, and also the tax and other incomes.
Third, there is no competition between US citizen and international students. You should know company would like to hire citizen but not foreigners, if the citizen lost his job and replaced by a foreigner, that means that citizen is extremely bad worker.
I love United States, and I would like to do something as a feed back to this country. I support this OPT expanding and I believe the judge of the US government.
