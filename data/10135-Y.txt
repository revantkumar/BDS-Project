I was teaching English as a Second Language for a time at Silicon Valley University here in San Jose CA. I found that the students who were being recruited from China and India and trained for tech jobs and then not returning to their countries but were funneled into the tech fields at low wages. Some of companies were those set up by people from their homeland. My son, who had just graduated from RPI was not able to work in these foreign-led firms at the wages offered and still pay back his student loans.
