I strongly support the proposal for reasons below:

1. The new proposal creates an extension for OPT of international students to 24 months, which gives them opportunity to find a job in STEM field and contribute more to the country.

2. U.S. is the leader of the world not only because the hard work of native residents, but also the capability to attract talents from all over the world.

3. In this world with more and more competitions, U.S. need new blood to refill its energy and keep moving on the STEM field. By doing so, U.S. can not be left behind by the trend.
