I support this new rule because students earned degrees in America will have longer time and more opportunities to practice what they have learned and thus making contributions to America. For those who failed to understand and mistakenly believe the rule will take their jobs, the fact is foreign individuals with visas CAN ONLY get hired if NO qualified citizen can be found. The employer need to pay above average salaries as well as preparing paperworks indicationg why hiring this foreign individual but not a citizen. Moreover, F-1 sutdents and OPT workers are LEAGAL individuals in this contry, they come to this country with proper paperworks, and they PAY TAX the same as citizens. People should care more about ILLEGAL immigrants coming to this counrty by simply crossing the border without paperwork and drian all TAXPAYER's (including F1 students and OPT workers!) welfare WITHOUT PAYING TAX,
