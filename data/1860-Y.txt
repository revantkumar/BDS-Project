I strongly support the extension. US is now the leader in technology. None can deny that there is a huge contribution of professionals from other countries to the technology and economy of US. STEM professionals with their advanced degrees can definitely help to prosper US more and maintain the top spot. If the STEM extension is revoked, US might soon be overtaken by other countries like India and China as retention of talent would become difficult. US should welcome diversity. STEM students take education in US and they contribute by applying their knowledge and skills by innovation of amazing products and bolster US economy.
