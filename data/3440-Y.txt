I really think it is necessary to extend OPT for F-1 students as it is a precious chance for international students to gain working experience in a foreign country. As most of the students would, after finishing OPT, go back to work in their own countries, experience gained during OPT would help them greatly if their job involves english, or they work in a multinational corporation.
