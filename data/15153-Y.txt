The prosperity of United States relies on bringing new working force, especially the high-profile working force. STEM students, after receiving their master degree or PhD degree, are certainly workers with high quality. OPT is an important way to enable those STEM students to work in US, and providing a 24-month OPT extension is essential to all industries in US. This policy will also receive warmly welcome from all international students. I strongly suggest the approval of a 24-month OPT extension.
