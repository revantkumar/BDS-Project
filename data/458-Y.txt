alex Jeffery I oppose the extension of OPT.
Schools, especially public schools, welcome foreign students because they pay high tuition. And then, with extension of OPT, they earn back what they invest and maybe much more. Who is the winner? Obviously, foreign students who get more than they invested, schools which get a lot of money and companies which get a lot of comparable cheap workers. Who is the loser? Obviously not the government, the working Americans are loser, the middle class is loser. They take risk of losing their jobs but they don't get any benefit from having more and more foreign students.
