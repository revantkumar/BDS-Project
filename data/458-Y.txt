Well I personally OPPOSE to opt extension for certain major graduates. Simply it is unfair to non stem graduates who have spent the same or even more international tuitions and fees.Also this policy will squeeze the chance of the next year h1b candidates if stem guaduates fail to win their first year lottery
In addition, I've noticed a phenomenon that stem students are normally with weak language and communication skills prevents themeslves from being involved in the US society and their those negative features will probably influence the next generation at home.
People make strategies should see a big picture of this country, which means making up job market shortage matters but may not be as important as allowing the ones who will contribute to the US with their extraordinary characters and thoughts to stay.
