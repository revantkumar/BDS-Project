Tom Fu U.S. invests a lot of international students of STEM majors. It is wasting U.S.'s money if making the students leave the country after their graduation. The purpose of investment is to get profit. The profit of the international students is that they can make grate contribution to U.S. by their major and knowledge. 

The problem we have is IT Consulting Company (ICC), but not the international students. The purpose of ICC is to lie to U.S. government and move a lot of non-eligible workers to U.S. It is very common that ICC apply multiple H1B positions for one person. ICC is just trying their best to lie to government. This is not the fault of international students, but the fault of ICC. ICC should be banned.
