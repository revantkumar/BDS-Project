I was in OPT and I really appreciated the 17 months of extension that was granted. 12 month is really not enough to for a project in engineering area. If I wasn't given enough time, I would not finish that project which is not only beneficial for me but also for the company that I worked in, which makes great product that improves peoples life quality in the state.

I am strongly supportive to this plan, which will give young and ambitious foreign students a chance to prove themselves and contribute their talents. Look around, most of the daily used product and big innovation are carried out by these young engineers. If they are not given enough time and opportunities, all they will be focusing on is how to survive and how to maintain their status, instead of changing the life of human. United states is a country which is built and prospered by immigrants who was provided with opportunities and fair treatments, let's keep this good tradition!
