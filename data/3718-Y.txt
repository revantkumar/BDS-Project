As a STEM PhD chemistry student spending five years to get my degree, I would like to contribute my knowledge and experience to the pharmaceutical industry in U.S. to develop new drugs for improving U.S patients life quality. As more and more H1B visa applications recently years, I heard that several of my friends have left U.S. due to unable to get H1B visa after OPT expiration. This is a big loss of talent scientists for U.S. high science and technology, which may further impact the long-term competition of U.S. with other countries in the world, like EU, Japan, China and more. If STEM student can have longer OPT, they will have more chance to get H1B, and they will have more chance to stay in U.S., to contribute their invaluable expertise to all areas of STEM, to make U.S. a leading country in the world.
