Hi there,

My name is Dingwei Lin. I was an International student from Northeastern Univ. Boston, Mass. My major was eligible for STEM OPT extension. I already came back to my country China. Now, I have to stand out and say something.

1.With OPT extension, I can pay US government taxes even I am not a US citizen.
2.I work for a high tech company, so the taxes are a lot.
3.With OPT extension, I was able to find a job after I graduated, which helped me to open my career as an engineer.
4.As an engineer, I develop software that is implemented into many big giants products --- Apple, Samsung, Amazon (etc.) products. These technologies have completely changed the world. They make your life easier. And yes, US market is of course the first one to use these advanced technologies.
5.Our parents give us money to pay for private school tuitions. Those are big cash flows even for many rich universities. With these cash flows more local US students can apply for loans to advanced educations. University facilities will benefit from these money too. I think at least we deserve some extra time for practical training. 
6.Many students actually dont stay that long during their OPT extension. For me, I just used 5 months of my 17 months extension. Many students that I know they didnt even stay longer than 6 months after they graduated. Some of them believe China is a better place for their careers while some of them have to take care of family business.
7.Most of the International students will eventually go back to their own countries.

If I wish I can make a long long long list but I dont have to. I believe my statement is clear and good enough. And people in Washington should realize how great a person can become if he/she is educated in US.
