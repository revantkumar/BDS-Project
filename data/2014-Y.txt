Xu Han I support the 24 month OPT extension rule and I want to make one point clear to American local people: This 24 month OPT extension is for non-immigrant status, not for immigrant status. The rule can do NOTHING to grab local american people's benefits.

Most of us foreigners will be going back to our home countries after the 24 month extension ends up due to it is a non-immigrant program authorization. So do not worry about us taking more employment opportunities from you or getting over populating in the US. 

Yes, you may say: how can you guarantee you are going to honnor your promise? Well, if you do not trust me, at least you can trust the US immigrant law, and search for related laws to see how hard to immigrate to the US. 

I believe after you know how hard the way it is, you will give up opposing the 24 month OPT extension rule, the rule can do nothing to grab local american people's benefits.
