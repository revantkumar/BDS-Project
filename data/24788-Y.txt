OPT is awesome!

I am doing post completion OPT as a software engineer at Oracle America, an awesome globalized company!

Getting real working experience related to my study is so important. It was a big factor in my decision to choose USA over other countries as the destination to study for my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. The initial 12-month post-completion OPT is definitely not long enough considering it usually takes one to several months to get used to the training environment.

The proposed 24-month STEM extension along with the improved oversight would definitely benefit both the STEM students and the United States. Talents like us can serve this country for longer, boosting science and technology advancement. At the same time, we are contributing to the tax revenue and business consumption to this country just by working and living. By allowing high quality educated professionals who has a globalized vision and solid expertise in science and technology, to participate in the labor market on a short-or-medium-term basis, the US worker's right may be just slightly and minimally affected. But the energy, the vitality, the momentum of the science and technology labor market would be maximized. USA's unique competitiveness in reserving top quality labor force would be retained.

As far as I am concerned, while I don't mind going back to my original country, or even switch to another alternative country to continue my career, an extended OPT would probably drive me to stay here and work longer.
