Wholeheartedly support this extension, from my understanding, letting skilled and talented international students coming to US will only benefit the tech corps be more competitive against companies around the world. If a F-1 student earned a degree from the US and go back to their countries after graduation, it is the countries that take advantage of US education system and they will eventually surpass USA.
