I would like to mention that as an engineering Ph.D. candidate, I would like to have an opportunity to contribute to research in the U.S. tech industry, where demand for highly skilled workers is higher than the supply from native workers. Hence by joining the workforce, I will contribute to the U.S. economy as well as enhance my professional experience. Also, in my field of research which is aerospace, already many positions are reserved for U.S. citizens, which means that multiple opportunities to apply for H1-B VISA is vital for students like us.

please take the points above into your consideration.
thank you
