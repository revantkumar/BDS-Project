This new rule is potentially making tremendous contribution to the U.S and I strongly support it. As an engineer student, I decide to pursue my master degree two years ago. With admission from France, Britain and the U.S.,I finally decided to take the chance from U.S. because of the better training opportunity it can provide me. OPT is the most important reason that makes me believe that U.S. has the best education resources for myself. So I gave up the scholarship from other country, paid the extremely high expense and came here as an international student. Without OPT, campus life is almost all the university here can provide to an international student, which is far from enough for those potential bachelors,masters and doctors who are preparing themselves for their future career. I am pretty sure if this rule is rejected, U.S. will be much less attractive for students all over the world. Somebody says there is one year for you to practice. I think everyone knows what one year means in the real industry. Right now I am working in an machine vision company. Our schedule is pretty tight so our team have to finish our current project by the end of 2016... Within one year, nothing serious can be finished. So OPT extension is more necessary many people thought it would be. Other than this, I think it is reasonable to give more opportunities to students majoring other fields, such as economy and art. In this diverse country, people from all over the work have done terrific job in multiple files. More friendly policy will definitely make U.S. much more developed from all the perspectives.
