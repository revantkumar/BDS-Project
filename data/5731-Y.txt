Alan Grosso I am absolutely opposed to this rule. American students and workers should not have to compete with foreign
students for jobs in this country. We have an obligation to our own citizens and legal residents. If increased training is
needed, then we should do everything possible to accomplish that. 

This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share 
of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Bad incentive which works against US citizens and legal residents.
