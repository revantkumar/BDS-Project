Just now I were listening to the speech from CORNELIA LEVY-BENCHETON, the author of Woman in tech. Below is the situation U.S is gonna face in the next 3 years:

1, STEM occupation is growing from 6.8 million to 8 million by 2018;
2, STEM job openings: 2.4 million job openings through 2018 including 1.1 ne new jobs and 1.3 replacement jobs
3, According to OECD data, U.S's average math and tech skills and knowledges are all below average, and they are still dropping. It will increase 1.7% U.S GDP if we could make it to the average level among OECD countries. 

From the data above we can easily see that in fact the STEM extension will not influence job market at all since they are still growing. These degrees need at least more than 5-10 years professional training if we lose our F! students, we are gonna lose GDP we now have and more profit we could have potentially. Especially when they get back to their own country like China and india with technologies and skills and develop STEM industry there, we will have to lose even more advantages and job openings from all industries in future. 

I am currently working in a data intelligence company and it is common knowledge how difficult to find a qualified student. Company like us and responsible entrepreneurs like Ms. Bencheton are trying our best to stay people like them. It will be totally benefit if we could have extension for STEM degrees.
