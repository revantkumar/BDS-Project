I strongly RECOMMEND this OPT-extension for the following reasons: 

Technology is the key factor for developing American economy. However, with fewer people in america contribute to such industry, it is REALLY a need to have more immigrants with stronger background. Let's face it, many of great inventions, innovations were made by non-americans-computers, internet, space travelling... you name it. It would be INSANE to not provide more ways for those.

Besides, it is really important for us americans to have different voices, different cultures, different opinions. Because they were all grown up in different countries, they tend to have more vast experience. We could really use those voices.

Third, it's in the constitution that america is a fusion of different cultures. That's how we got here-one of the greatest country of the world.
