Laura Tong As a STEM students, I am strongly support the proposed rule for expanding OPT. For me, I can apply what I learn to the real industry. From US economy perspective, the STEM students will have an impact on US Tech Companies' prosperity as well as the US economy. It is a win-win proposal for STEM students and US residents. So I totally support the " Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students" Rule.
