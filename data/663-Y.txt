I strongly support this OPT extension policy, with reasons as follow: 
1, For STEM majors, there are few domestic students studying these majors, especially in the graduate (Master or Ph.D.) programs. These majors are considered to be tough, thus students intend to choose non-STEM majors such as economics, accounting or financing. However, lots of high-technology companies need the graduate from these majors, in which a large number of international students are studying. 

3, US has the most large number of high-technology companies, and High-technology companies has great amount of contributions to US GDP, and playing the role of boosting up economy. Those companies need huge demand of graduates from STEM majors. As few local students study these majors, if companies are restricted to only recruiting local students, the demand cannot be satisfied. Also, the extension of OPT is needed, since fresh graduate need time to be trained and adapt to the working environment. If only one year OPT is provided, they need to leave immediately after they are right ready to work in a more efficient and effective way.

3, A very high percentage of international students study in the graduate programs. Usually funding is provided to international Master or Ph.D. students as the financial support. It is a good chance to international students to contribute their knowledge and intelligence to our society after graduating, not wasting the funding supporting them during their purchasing the high-level education degrees.
