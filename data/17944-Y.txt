As mentioned in the summary of this document, the rule is needed to replace the previous 17-month version. The only reason that one got shot down is because of the lack of formal procedure, which is what we are doing here. If the rule did not go through, then the impact on the tech industry will be devastating. Moreover, it sends a message that our country no longer welcomes talents from outside just because they are, well, from the outside. That is directly in contract to the basic belief of Americans. With that said, I hope this rule gets passed as it should be.
