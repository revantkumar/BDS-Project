Why does the Homeland Security Department think that is has the Constitutional authority to write immigration legislation?

Because that is what the change in 'policy' will do.

This change will effectively increase the number of foreign workers allowed in the US well past existing legislative limits.

Congress has the authority to make any change in immigration numbers - not nameless bureaucrats.

With our current surplus of STEM workers why would the government increase competition for scarce STEM jobs?

If you want to argue and increase legal immigration - let the Congress conduct hearings and if it passes so be it, don't shove it through via executive fiat.
