mengnan wang I support the proposal ( Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002) to extend the STEM OPT period by 24 months.

The extension of duration of the period is very appropriate. It will give students the chance to achieve their objectives of their study by practical training. One year of OPT is definitely not enough for STEM major graduates to gain experience and make a contribution to their team and company. 

As STEM graduates are highly skilled, their contribution will also benefits United State in many aspects. First of all, the existence of the 29 months' of OPT is one of the most important the reason for most of the foreign students to pursue their education in United States. The OPT policy helps attract the most talented students from all around the world, thus help keeping the U.S. universities globally competitive and keep diversity. The foreign students with the help of OPT will increase the quantity and quality of the research and innovation which is beneficial to U.S. economy and technology development. 

I also support the regulation to implement some further requirements for the training which can prevent the abuse of the program.
