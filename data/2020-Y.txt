I strongly SUPPORT the proposal this proposal for the following reasons:
I think why the US is the most developed countries in the aspects of both science and social regulation is that it has the spirit of social inclusion.
The excellent international graduate student make their huge contributions to developing this country, if the country no longer has the spirit of diversity, the society will lose its competitiveness. 
Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Competition can improve the quality for both local students and international students, and create a atmosphere of eagerly improving themselves.
And countless evidences have suggested that many excellent international students have made their great contribution to help US become a great country and countless excellent and hardworking international engineer contributes to improve the life quality for each ordinary people.
