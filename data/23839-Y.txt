OPT extension is a win-win for both international students and US. 

First of all, it is beneficial to international students. For STEM major students, after finishing their degree, they can have up to 3 years to not only learn how to apply their knowledge in the industries and but also master the subjects they deal with. This cannot be done within only 1 year OPT. STEM majors are science and engineering major. These major related jobs are not easy to get started with. They usually take longer for students to be a professional. 

Secondly, OPT extension is beneficial to US. High quality education with complementary 3 years OPT period is a selling point of UShigher education. This will gain reputations for US higher education internationally. One year is not considered long enough for STEM majors to gain some real industry experience. It is also not long enough for students to demonstrate their talents to help develop US frontier technologies. Most US firms will face the risk to lose these talented students without receiving the payoff after training them for the first year, because of the H1B visa cap. OPT extension may not totally solve this issue but at least a remediation. 

The OPT extension will allow both US firms and international students to have time to create values.
