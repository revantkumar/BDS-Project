I am a foreign graduate student in Physics. I strongly support extending OPT.
I would like to make a few points after viewing a few opposing comments:

1. It is impossible for employers to employ less skilled foreigners over hardworking Americans, because the cost is higher if the employer has to maintain the employee's status to let him stay in US, and the risk of the employee leaving is higher, not to mention having language and cultural problems. So if an American's skill is equal or higher than any foreigner that he compete with, he shouldn't worry about foreigners taking his job. 

2. There are a lot of jobs in Physics, Chemistry, and Material etc, that are so dangerous or so complicated, that most Americans are not willing to do, for example handling HF (hydrofluoric acid) or doing Heavy Metal Vapour Deposition, which is an essential part of semiconductor industry, I know because I do this and none of the Americans in our group dare to do. Many of my friends find jobs like that in industry. So make it harder for us to get these jobs would not have any benefit on economy.

3. If you have been in a University or Research Institution, you can easily find that for Physics, Chemistry, Material, Computer Science people who are on top of their field, the professors and the best PhDs etc, most of them are not Americans. Making it harder for them to stay in America would definitely hurt scientific progress in general.

4. Most Americans doesn't have American origin, and their parents or grandparents can be legal immigrants, America is known for freedom and accepting talented people from all over the world. There is certainly no point in looking down upon any other race and think they are inferior in any way, or intentionally mix up legal and illegal immigrants to make legal immigration look like a crime. If immigration was not allowed, many Americans may not even be here. I think as long as we prove our abilities and work hard, we should be encouraged to stay.
