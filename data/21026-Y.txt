When discussing a proposal like this, I think its potential overall impact on the nation should be emphasized much more than that on limited amount of individuals. From this perspective, I truly believe that the extension on STEM OPT is essential and will be significantly beneficial to the US. 

Nowadays, many employers especially in high-tech industries are hiring international students in OPT program. But why do they do this (and many of them even are willing to do this), rather than all hiring US citizens instead? The reason must be: there are high demands on talented people for those jobs, which can 't be filled solely by suitable American candidates in the market. Simple as that. 

It makes one thing clear that OPT students are not taking any employment opportunities form US citizens; on the contrary, they are providing more power and possibilities to those companies, those industries, and the country. Eventually, this kind of boost will in turn enhance economy and even create more job opportunities in the US. 

In addition, OPT extension can significantly increase the attractions of education degrees in the US. A comprehensive and advanced education experience is never all about theoretical knowledge, it's more about applying what you learned practically. That's why programs like Co-op, CPT, OPT have come into being. 

STEM OPT extension will just make this more possible. With it, education degrees in America can be more attractive compared with those in many other countries. As an effect, more international students will bring more money and resources to the US, and is good for the country.
