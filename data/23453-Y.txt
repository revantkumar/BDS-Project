It'll be a pity that if we STEM degree students couldn't have enough of time dedicate our skills for the US industry after graduation. As a computer graphic professional, it cost us a lot of time just learning those professional software and trying to complete our own thesis during school. 12 months are just not enough for us to find the opportunities and dedicate our strength to the job because it usually takes a long period of time to actually finish a project in most computer graphic companies. It will be a lost for the companies who spend time training the new employee and it will be a lost for the US because you might miss some really talented people who are trying to give their life to you.
