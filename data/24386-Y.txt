I was an international student who have studied in Michigan Tech, and then accepted an offer from a power system software company. I would say the STEM-OPT extension policy benefits not just our new grads, but the company and Americans as well. I have heard from my colleague, our company now selling our software to all over the world, and just bought a brand new office to recruit more people for improving our software further. I am not saying the fast booming of the company is only because of the hiring of international student, but we do have an significant contribution. In our company, engineers are also responsible for the customer service, for there are lots of technical problems, and since we have customer from all over the world, it is better for the company to have engineers who understand them better. This year, we have around ten people joining our company, and at least half of them are Americans, so the saying of hiring international students would take over Americans positions is not likely to be true, at least for our company.
Having the extension is crucial for company to fully benefited from international students. As a new hire, it will take some time to really understanding the job and also the company, so maybe only after the first year, can these new employees be a real asset for the company. Besides, even though we are not citizens, we still pay all the taxes and made our contributions to the American economy. In the end, I would say I strongly agree with this policy, and I believe it will keep benefiting both sides.
