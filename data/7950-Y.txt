I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

I am a F-1 nonimmigrant graduates and now I work in the top tech companies in the U.S. Without the extension of OPT for STEM degree students, many other talented nonimmigrant students who lack of the luck to get H1B in their first year would have to leave U.S. Without the extension, U.S is losing these talented students.
