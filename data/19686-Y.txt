I strongly support the proposal of extending OPT by 24 months for international students in STEM majors. 

It's been well known that international graduates with STEM degrees make up a large amount of engineers/scientists in technical areas where there is a lack of interest by American citizens. These graduates are working hard, contributing to the progress of science and engineering and paying their due taxes. 

This will be a great way of keeping these foreign young talents that will do great good to the long term development of the country.
