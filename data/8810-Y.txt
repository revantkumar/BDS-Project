I'm now studying in the STEVENS institute of technology in Hoboken,NJ as an undergraduate. Majoring in industrial engineering, I can see how we international student can contribute to this fantastic country. I have lived with several American girls these years. We're really good friends and through them, I can see how friendly Americans are. We have talked a lot about our studies and majors. I can see that there are great potentials in manufacturing in America. It needs devotions,no matter Americans or us international students. The OPT extension can provide the firms a chance to find these qualified workers and truly improve the life of Americans. This is the true benefit that relates to everyone, be it blue collars, white collars or professors. We are not here for exploiting resources. We are here to contribute to a better America. I can see that lots of firms are welcoming our international students to their companies to do work, to investigate our knowledge and values to the society. 

It would benefit a lot for the America society. Together, through hard work we can make a better U.S.
