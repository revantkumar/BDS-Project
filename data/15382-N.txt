There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.

This is the kind of thing that makes me ashamed to be an American. And shame on those who have proposed or are supporting this disgusting idea.
