Depriving OPT extension policy will cause great loss in high-tech market in US because of the resulted tremendous leak of international elites in software market. 

According to the statistics from (http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/the-stem-workforce-an-occupational-overview/), STEM occupations account for 25.4 percent of the professional labor force. Such large amount proportion will be largely reduced if international employees (OPT) have to leave US. The upcoming vacant of previous positions taken by those leaving international employees will then greatly reduce the company productivity. Regardless of extra time and expense cost for finding US citizens to fill the vacant, the total amount of US students studying computer science can not meet the demand. Losing supply from international computer science students, the previous balance will be broken and company have to consider cutting products. All these consequence will form a negative cycle and finally collapse the software market in US.
