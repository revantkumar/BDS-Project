Lingxiang Yin I definitely support the OPT extension.

Firstly, the No.1 reason I choose to pursue my study in America is that I will have a chance to put what I have learnt into practice after I graduate. This is very important for a student, especially for an international student.

Secondly, this policy will also attract many talented people from all over the world to study here and make contributions to America.

Thirdly, this policy could bring a lot of benefits for the resident in America. For example, most of international students will choose rent a apartment or live in the house during their study and after their graduation, so there will be a big mount of rent every year for those residents.

Finally, this won't hurt the residents' right. Students are only allowed to take practice related to their major, so there is no such serious competition between international students and the residents.
