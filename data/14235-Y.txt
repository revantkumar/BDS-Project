I think extending STEM is beneficial for the US society in the long run. On one hand, the students on STEM policy are mostly high end personals which can contribute significantly to the economy. This can potentially create more job opportunity in the long run. On the other hand, the US tax payers has spend huge amount of money on educating these people who might be the smartest ones in their home countries. keeping them in US and let them contribute to US keeps the United States to be more competitive in the world, while forcing them to go is not only a waste of US tax payers' money but also a loss of the country.
