I totally agree with this proposal for giving STEM students more chances to learn from working in USA. As a foreign student here, I am in favor of this proposal not for the likely increasing possibility of staying in USA, but it is the equity and human rights embody in it. Foreign students come to this Country, bring the country with their fortune (their money and their intelligence that create development here), it is their right to enjoy more benefits here. I am not inciting government loosing their policy for immigrant, but at least this proposal signify the improvement for human right of foreigners. I think that is why American is always so fascinating and distinguished among other countries in the world.
