Alice Xu The STEM extension should not be cancelled. Moreover, the proposal of longer extension should be approved! I am a STEM student myself. I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to study in US. My school has granted me fellowship and invested a lot on me so that I am graduating with various skills that other people do not have. I really want to apply these skills by working here. I feel like to contribute to the country that cultivated me. In addition, I also want to get some hands-on experience before I go back to my home country. I am majoring in Biology research related fields. I believe my work here will help to save lives. Just grant me the opportunity to do that!
