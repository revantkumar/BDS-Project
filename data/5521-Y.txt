I think this rule will continue to expand the US influence to other countries by promoting the cultural understanding. There are more and more foreign students with US study background start to contribute to US economy. China, the world's biggest exporter of foreign students to the U.S., has become a large source of donations for the Ivy League. In July 2014, SOHO China Chief Executive Zhang Xin and her husband, Pan Shiyi, signed a $15 million gift agreement with Harvard University as part of their $100 million endowment to send underprivileged Chinese children to elite universities around the world. In 2010, Lei Zhang, the founder and managing partner of Hillhouse Capital Management, said he would give $8,888,888 to Yale University, which marked the largest gift to the Yale School of Management by a graduate of the school. These foreign students definitely do not cause the high unemployment rates. In contrast, they will create more jobs in US after the training. For the people who object this rule, I ask you to change your biased opinion and maintain a friendly environment for these foreign students with bright future.
