I fully support expanding the opportunities for STEM degrees. If the STEM students go back to their home country, they will bring what they learn from the American universities to contribute to their home countries. In this case, the STEM students' countries will quickly catch up with or even surpass US in the technology industry. We cannot risk to cultivate the STEM students by using our American most advanced resources and then just let them go back to equip their country to fight against us.
