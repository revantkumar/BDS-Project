I strongly support the new rule. The stem f1 students are highly qualified and work in the technology and science sector. These guys are not eating away the American jobs and infact US needs more workers with STEM degrees. The F1 opt students are critical for the growth of US economy and letting them go will put a lot of US based hitech companies in jeopardy. So I strongly support the new rule.
