I support this rule because this will benefit the US economy from several points below.
1. Keep attracting the best and smartest students all over the world to study in a US university. Those students are not eligible for any student loan, all of them are paying expensive tuition fee, and out side state fee. those money either are from their home country or their family. Those cashflow will in return improve the resources (books, courses, programs) and benefit domestic students. 
2. This rule will help STEM students work in tech field after they graduate for a period, this further help them learn the skills required in an industrial environment. In the meantime, their productivity is beneficial to US economy. 
3. There are many tech startups, middle size companies that need passionate students who don't care salary the most but the impact and passion towards what they are working on. Usually, it's very difficult for them to hire experienced domestic workers because of the cost. In this case, 2 or 3 years of a passionate and smart fresh graduates will fit in and help the company survive and thrive and further benefit the economy. I don't think this will affect domestic STEM graduates because there is strict rules that companies should give priority to domestic workers. Usually, it's the case the company couldn't compete to get the skill set they need from domestic then hire internationals. 
4. International student workers are under strict rules and they pay a lot tax on time. This is also considered good to the economy.
