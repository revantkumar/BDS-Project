I have been working at a CSU part-time for the last 5 years in engineering. Our engineering students often have difficulty 
in finding permanent employment after graduation with a B.S. degree.

Several of our student assistants that have graduated without employment opportunities have gone back to school for a 
Master degree. Others have continued as student assistants for extended periods of time.

I do not understand why we must employ non-citizens for many jobs that have security issues, while our own engineering 
graduates that are citizens or permanent residents are under employed or unemployed. We have talent here in the USA.
