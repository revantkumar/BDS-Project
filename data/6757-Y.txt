I believe that a relatively longer working time for nonimmigrant student can have definitely more economic benefit than those who only have one year working chance. People can contribute times more benefits after working a year. Especially in the STEM area. The students can get familiar with the working lives and get more social experience in one year, but the significant achievement they can make does need more time. Those achievements are crucial for our society. It's a great chance for competent students to show their talents and capabilities in a longer time.
