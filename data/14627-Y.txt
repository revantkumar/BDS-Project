I strongly agree with this rule, here are my reasons:

1. The typical time frame for an IT industry project is about half year to one year. However, it's impossible for a new-grad student to work on a project immediately. Usually it takes half an year to one year to get familiar a whole picture of product, the working tools and environment. So one year is not enough, it will make IT companies waste money on these students. The those students can only get familiar rather than be productive, and forced to leave the U.S.. It's not beneficial to both local companies and international students.

2. Diversity is always the key point attracting international students to come to the U.S., and it brings to innovation and productivity to this country. A longer OPT can make U.S. more attractive than other European college, because it can help students gain more expertise and experience during F1 status.
