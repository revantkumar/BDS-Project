I support this rule for the following reasons:
1. Giving everyone equal chance is American spirit. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.
2. Having talented foreign people work in IT area is good for US economy.
3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US.
