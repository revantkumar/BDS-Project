xiaoru wei I strongly support the proposal:
1. when we applied the OPT first time, we know that we have 29 months extension, but after half year, the extension change to 12 months, that means we do not have one chance to get H1 even, this is a creditworthiness problem. but this 24 months proposal give us confidence again.
2. if this proposal cannot prove, then there are a huge amount of students need back to their own country, after this year, the foreign students will decrease rapidly, that is not good for the economic of America.
3. America will lose a lot of technical person.
4. A lot of technical person want to make contribution to America, but they even do not have opportunity.
5.foreign people are not rush work from the native person, everybody know that it is too hard to find a job in a foreign country(language, sponsor, local conditions), if they could find a job even, that means the company need them really, if you are a good technical person, you will never afraid that the foreign person will rush your job.
6. the world only could strong in the competition.

so please give us and your own country a chance to be strong.
