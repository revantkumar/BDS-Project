Re: Comments on Proposed Rule: Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students

80 Fed. Reg. 63375 (October 19, 2015)
Docket ID: ICEB-2015-0002

Dear Chief Westerlund:

I strongly support the OPT extension program as this has created opportunities not only to the students from other notions, but also an opportunity to find the young and dynamic talent for bringing prosperity and vision to this nation.

In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. If you observe, those who have graduated here are working in the nation and paying taxes that is helping the economy in many ways. They are going through a formal interview process to get selected and the firms are hiring them as they have the required skill set. 

This is a better program to implement as these are genuine candidates who came to achieve the dream in a positive way and bring prosperity to the nation.

Regards,
David Sadler
