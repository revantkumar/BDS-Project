This is good rule for america. I have two points.

1. if you can't find a job and think it is foreign STUDENT taking your job, think about your own skill set. You can't even compete with foreign student who generally have poorer English, less networking, culture difference. 

2. usually STEM foreign students are hired in high tech area which is what USA trying to keep at the top of the world. If US can continue lead the world on high tech/bio tech etc. All US citizens will benefit from the money sucking from all over the world and jobs created in america. 

who think they deserve a job but do not want to compete with the world will lose the job eventually. Stop complaining and keep studying hard and you'll get a job anywhere in the world.
