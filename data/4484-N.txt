Regarding DHS Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002
Our nation already gives more than ample economic and social opportunity to foreign students and many of those students are eligible for and make us of educational grants, Social Security benefits, unemployment benefits, and no-cost or low-cost medical care, all at taxpayer expense and with little or no return. These foreign students, once graduated, also tend to take American jobs rather than to return to their homeland.
The reason is that OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.
