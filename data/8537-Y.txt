Alex Jordan The US was built by hard working people for over 200 years, It's ours, not a gift to the wretched victims of the world.
Knowingly or unknowingly they made their situation. Let them work it out for themselves.
By the way, we are almost bankrupt with our miserable government handling of our hard work earned wealth.
