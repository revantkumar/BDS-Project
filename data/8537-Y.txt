I totally support the new 24 months OPT extension policy, the reason are listed below:
1. USA is a typical immigrant country and because of this great racial diversity which makes USA the most prosperous country in this world;
2. USA is known of "American Dream" which attracts well educated people all over the world especially people who possess degrees in STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). These high educated people can help improving USA's economics, technology and can create more job opportunities for the whole society.
3. for people who get their degrees in STEM from qualified institutes, after they graduate, they need time and opportunities to use their knowledge to contribute to USA society so it is important for them to be able to extend OPT for longer time to do more for the community.
