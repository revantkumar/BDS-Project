Baoan Liu I am an international student pursuing the STEM PhD degree in United States. The OPT STEM extension is extremely important for my future career if I decide to do startup business in United States after graduation.

I am very glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. With the OPT STEM extension, the STEM graduates like me who plan to do startup business after graduation can have three years to prepare and start the business before making profits, and obtain the H1B working visa. Without the OPT STEM extension, we can only stay in USA for one year, which is extremely difficult for us to simultaneously startup and obtain the working visa within one year.

As a STEM PhD student, our academic training gives us the ability to invent new technologies and convert the technologies to the startup business. In addition, startup business in the United States has demonstrated great benefits to both entrepreneur and the US citizen employees. As a result, the OPT STEM extension can benefits both the international graduates with STEM advanced degrees and the current US citizens job seekers.

I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.
