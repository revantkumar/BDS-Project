I strongly support this proposal for the reasons:

It is important for the United States itself to keep her spirit alive, an open mind, and the momentum of moving forward. US becomes one of the greatest nations not by keeping elites and great minds such as A. Einstein out.

US Universities admitted talented foreign students each year and provided them the first class education. What good will it do to deprive their chance of finding a job and applying their knowledge and skills learnt after graduation?

Shutting the door up will not bring back more jobs and the economic power. It will only lose the US attraction to the foreign talented young minds and send US to a dead end.
