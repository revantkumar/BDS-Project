I strongly support the OPT extension. As an international student, one of the most important reason I came to the Unites States for master degree is that this country provides very good practical training program, for example, OPT extension. As a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering, I truly know that how different the real world is from what we learnt from the book, and the only way to get practical experience is through OPT after graduation. However, there are many projects could last for 2 or 3 years during OPT, so 1 year OPT simply doesn't meet this timeline, which will certainly take away the qualification of a student on 1 year OPT from this project.
