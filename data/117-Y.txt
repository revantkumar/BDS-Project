I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Firstly, the government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. Many or even most of high rank engineers and scientists are former F1 students to the country.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Most F1 students are looking for positions that are abundant for U.S. citizens. Those job positions are high rank and will not rise up the competition.
