I just cannot think of one reason why we don't pass this as soon as possible!!!!! Some people think that foreigners are taking their opportunities, but that's not the truth!!!! I have seen so many international students here they are getting incredible hard to find a job only because they are not citizenship although they work extremely harder and have grades way better than American guys. Americans take one month to get several offers to choose from and those international genius work for companies with low pay and bare benefits. Can you believe that they paid much higher education fees than American people to come to this "great" country to chase their dreams and this "great" country doesn't even want to give them much opportunities? This is not what a leading country should do. I will be extremely disappointed if US doesn't pass this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We should pass this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
