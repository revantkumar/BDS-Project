I support this extension for STEM students to work in the United States for 7 more months. The H-1B lottery affects a few of my close friends and I understand how frustrating it is that they work hard in a STEM field to be in the U.S. only to have their fate decided in a lottery. The additional time will definitely help and international students in the STEM field have definitely had a positive impact on the U.S. You can see it in the research done at top universities or at big STEM companies.
