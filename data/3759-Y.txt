I think new rule is pretty good because I as a IT company software engineer enjoy working with these foreign employees. They are polite and smart. This rule allows more and more talented students staying in this country. It makes this society stable and peace. 
I also agree the job opportunity should be fair. Why we have such limited job openings on market? The whales meet their winter?
Our problem is not OPT extension but job openings.
