I strongly support the expansion of the OPT extension. 
As mentioned in the DHS's proposal, "The proposed changes would help ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive." On the contrary, lack of practical training opportunities will disencourage international students to consider studying abroad in the US. Take Canada as an example, its ranking on higher education decays this years after they have a stricter regulation on practical training program according to the Global Competitiveness Index. 
Besides, US News claims that "In Indiana, international students bring $688 million in economic benefits, equivalent to 40 percent of what the state spends on higher education every year." It is also common in others states. The expansion of OPT will guarantee the economic benefits brought by international students. Otherwise, state governments have to swallow huge deficits in education.
