Ravikiran Tangirala I am in full support of this proposal about the OPT extension. It will ensure U.S universities stay competitive in attracting excellent international students around the world. This will help STEM students get trained for sufficient amount of time. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist.
