This is a very good move from the Department of Homeland Security towards improving the training opportunities for F-1 students. F-1 students have been the core of the industry and have worked for living their American Dream.

Actions like these, help them being more confident and assured that they could continue to learn and grow. If this is actually improved further in a way that worthy students who tend to establish a business and/or improve and grow the industry should be eligible to apply for green card and plan ahead for a better future. Worrying about the in-assurance of not being eligible for working in the future stops many prospective students to bring new ideas and establish them as their business ideas, which seem to be a possible only under the benefits and the market conditions that are available in the USA.
