I agree with this proposal. Extend STEM OPT can make American schools more attractive for foreign students in corresponding industry. It provide a better guarantee that a foreign STEM student can get fully educated in both academic and industry. In turn, the US can get high quality student from all over the world to support the country in research and a variety of industries. With it, foreign students have more reason to contribute to this country. It is a win-win proposal. Foreign students get a better experience after graduation while employers get more high quality candidates to make them more competitive.
