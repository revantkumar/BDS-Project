Weidong Cheng This really is a bad proposal without any enforcement mechanisms.

Please have strict enforcement mechanisms, like monitoring the students that they are employed in the same field and not working in Gas stations, Grocery stores or in a Body shop just to maintain status without any pay. Check the pay stubs of the students periodically. If they are unemployed for 30 days cumulatively, they should immediately be out of the country. No questions. After all the premise here for this proposal is that these are highly skilled, highly sought after students.

Do not approve the EAD, until they have a job offer from the Employer. Also, please make sure that they are paid prevailing wages. Have an LCA requirement(Similar to H-1b), so that the employer files a petition to hire these students.(Of course, there is no CAP). Do not give the power to the Designated School official. Unfortunately, this is a bad proposal and you are using the support of the very beneficiaries who stand to benefit by this proposal who are commenting in mass quantities, as a basis to approve this proposal. This should not be the case, but that's how it is done now. It is similar to the H-4 EAD comments. 

Please have strong enforcement clause, and weed out fraud. The US education was once an esteemed accolade. Not any more. Universities are sprouting up left to right, and the National Polytechnic university(NPU) in Fremont, Silicon Vallye for Example is enrolling massive number of Post graduate students from India, who come to other US universities, study for one semester and do a school transfer to NPU, work illegally in grocery stores, work in homes cooking etc. I've personally witnessed this and again this is not one or two students, but en masse. More in the thousands. What's going on here? How can you let fraud happen right in front of your eyes, and do not take any action, and on top of it have a proposal to increase this. Beats me. 

Please have proper enforcement

Thanks
Weidong
