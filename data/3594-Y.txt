I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The international students learn knowledge and skills here and make contributions to US. I can only think of this as a win-win.

2. Diversity is what makes US all the way! And that's the secret that US can keep itself as an energetic and innovative country!

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It can improve the average skills for no matter the citizens or the international students! Only in this way, US can maintain its competitiveness in the world!
