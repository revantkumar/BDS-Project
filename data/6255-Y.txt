Ashley Goguen I strongly support the new OPT-extension for the following reasons: 

1) After gaining best education from American universities, it their duty to give back to american economy as return.

2) only 19% of all international employees, could stay and get a working VISA from the lottery. Thus, most of them will eventually go to their home country and work there, leaving a lot of vacancies for newly graduated students.

3) STEM students would definitely contribute greatly more to the American economics as well as the technology development. This new rule benefits both the employers and the employees hugely.
