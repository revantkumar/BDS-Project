I strongly support OPT extension. I am an international student and I interned at a number of big name silicon valley companies.

At the same time, I am also shocked to know how badly some people (not all!) are cheating on H1B visas. Those H1B cheaters fake resumes and experiences so that they could be hired in the US, to replace qualifi
