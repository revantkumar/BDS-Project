What contribute to today's US, the strongest country in the world? 
Every person may has his own answer, but , without doubt, the strongest education and strongest technology have a big place. 
Through hundreds of years, by attracting the most intelligent and diligent people from all the nations over the world, US becomes today's US. Working hard, creating something wonderful, this is so called "American dream".
OPT extension is a signal, which shows a hug on behalf of US to the people mentioned above.STEM students know the most difficult knowledge in the world, they deserve and should prove themselves by working in this land. On the other side, US also need them, and this is where US is much greater than the other countries in the world: his inclusiveness.
I support the extension, and i believe it will be a quite wise decision.
