Wen Zhang, Arizona State University I strongly suppose this proposal. Some people said, this proposal will has a adverse impact on American people's employment. I strongly disagree with this opinion. Acturally, most STEM students work in some field that a lot of American people don't have interest in. For example, some physics and mathematics major students are prefer to find some jobs mainly related to theory research and boring computation and program. However, American society needs this kind of talent. The proposal will promote the development of American society, and social diversity.
