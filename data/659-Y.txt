Visa should not keep people away from building a better world. STEM international students bring really really really fresh blood into United States. This blood not only keep tech companies and companies need science support moving fast and correctly. This blood would also keep the whole United States society more active and productive. People share their ideas, make ideas come true and learn from each other. Keeping STEM students away would definitely harm this. Industrial society will lose a lot of talented engineers and academic world will lose potential amazing ideas. Nobody want this to happen. Also, international students bring lots of profit to all other non-tech business such as restaurants, entertainment and airlines. The world would lose lots of business opportunity if we keep these amazing students away. We need these people to develop promising techs to make our life better and easier, like robotics and internet. STEM students are making these kind of industry more and more impacting to our life. We have no good reason to keep them away!
