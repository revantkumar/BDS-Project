I strongly support this rule! The U.S. is one of the most immigrant-friendly countries in the world, and intelligent immigrants from all over the world have consistently contributed to its global competitiveness, especially in high-tech industries. Apparently, this rule will benefit the U.S. economy significantly, as human capital becomes increasingly important in enhancing the competitiveness of a nation's economy.
