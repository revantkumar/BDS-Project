I support improving and expanding training Opportunities for F-1 students. Here are couple reasons:
1) A lot of companies may not provide intern opportunities to F-1 students if they can only work for one year. This will prevent F-1 students from gaining opportunities in big companies.
2) Even when students got the offer, they may not be able to prove their ability to their employers in such a short time. It's also hard to build the trust within a short time.
