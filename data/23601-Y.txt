I strongly agree with this new rule which creates a win-win situation for Americans and nonimmigrant international students. By extending the stem OPT period, certain international students can get more practical experience after graduating, and companies would lower their risk to lose qualified employees. Some Americans are worried about foreigners stealing their jobs. On the contrary, allowing skilled international students to work in the United States only creates a better and more competitive job market which further benefits American companies. It is very challenging for international students to find a job in the US so those who do find one always have very strong skills and graduate from top university programs. It would be a huge waste to America if they have to go back to their home country immediately after graduating.
