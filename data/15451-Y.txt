I strongly support this proposal since it is a win-win strategy for both USA and international students. For USA, high tech companies can hire international students with excellent ability and personality to create values, which bring more benefits for USA economy. For international students, this is a good opportunity to apply what they learned in University and gain more real-world industry.
