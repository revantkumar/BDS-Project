I support the 24 month OPT-extension for the following reason:
As a Ph.D. Student in engineering major. I was enrolled in the program with all the fee's covered by the university and funding sources from the NSF. In the past few years, I was trained to be a good researcher and engineer with analytical thinking and problem solving techniques. There are thousands of Ph.D. international students like me. I don't think it worth to spend to so much money to train students from other countries and let them leave after graduation ( it usually take a few months to find a job as an international student. If they cannot get H1B visa in the first 12 months, they would need the opt extension to get in the next H1B lottery system)

Yet, I think opt-extension shouldn't be abused, which mean it should be more selective ( eg. Requirements about university ranking, the student's GPA etc.)
