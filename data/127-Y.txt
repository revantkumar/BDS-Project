1. Almost everyone needs training when they join a new company, being a foreign students or native american does not make any difference on this part. According to experience of big companies like apple and facebook, associate level engineer needs like 3 months training under carefully chosen tasks before they are actually fit into the industry. 
2. As i've said, those training will be given to every new employee no matter whether he is american or not.
3. For this reason, if the OPT only lasts for 12 months then the companies only have many of their engineers 9 months of high efficiency working time and have to find someone new next year. You probably do not have idea about how bad this could be for tech company expecially many start ups.
