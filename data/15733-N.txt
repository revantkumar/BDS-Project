Dear Sir,
I find it very disturbing that our government is going to allow foreigners to take the jobs of unemployed college graduates and take away jobs from working men and women who are citizens.
Also, exactually where are these jobs located and why are they not advertised so Americans can find these jobs?
I need a reply to this
