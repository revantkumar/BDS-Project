The proposed rule does not take into account that people on this visa are not required to pay social security taxes and medicare taxes and neither are their employers required to pay. This puts US students with the same qualifications at a severe disadvantage to foreign students because once again the government is choosing foreign workers over US workers. I am against the OPT extension as it is unfair to US workers. If students are able to work under these visas, then they should be required to pay the same taxes everyone else in the US has to pay when they work. Their employers should also have to pick up social security and medicare taxes for them. Why is it the government continues to favor foreign students over US students and workers. I am against the rule. As a taxpayer, I'm tired of my children and friend's children being passed over for the government's preference and companies preference for cheap foreign labor. Withdraw the rule unless you change the tax advantages for foreign workers adn make employers first have to check if a qualified US student is available. I am disappointed and angry that the government continues to favor foreign workers over Americans. I also believe the comments of foreign workers who will advocate for this SHOULD NOT under any circumstances be taken into account. You should be concerned about American citizens only!
