Yi Li I'm a F1 PhD student currently studying computer science at UC Irvine. I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

First, I need to emphasize that, all the STEM jobs we are looking for are equal opportunity jobs. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission enforces the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on characteristics such race, color, sex, NATIONAL ORIGIN or religion. Therefore, our rights to work at US is protected by the US Constitution.

Second, our qualification of the job is equally evaluated through out the hiring process. If the employers offer jobs to us, it mostly suggests that we are better qualified for the jobs, for the employers and thus better for the economy in general. It is from my point of view one of the core ideas of US, that talented people from all over the world gather here and achieving their American dreams, and in the end makes US the greatest country in the world. Just barely take a look at how many executives of the high tech companies are originated from foreign countries (e.g. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, Harry Shum, vice president of Microsoft). 

Third, it's a huge cost for employers to circumvent the OPT expiration problem of F1 students. Lots of high tech companies have to relocate their foreign employees outside US who's OPT expires. So why don't we fix this problem at the very beginning by allowing them longer OPT extensions?

In general, I think the US job market should be free and competitive just like the US economy. Rather than regulations, I think the US government should try the best to maintain a fair and transparent job market that employers hire their employees completely based their qualifications of the jobs, without worrying too much about the consequences due to government regulations.
