I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for OPT extension.

I came to US in 2014, as one of the best student from China. I attended Stanford University for a master degree. As we all know, US becomes the best country in the world because of its achievements in science and technology. And these achievements can never come true, if US did not value talented people as it did in the past decades. 

Currently, IT is the most important and fast growing technology in the world. And we know, most of the greatest IT companies in US are formed by Chinese and Indian students. If the OPT extension is aborted, I believe these companies will never be able to maintain their competitiveness in the global scope. Many more great companies will emerge in Asia and other countries. US will face more competitors in the world, at least the leading role will be greatly weaken. 

Another important thing to mention is, most STEM students will pay a lot of tax to the US government. After they leave, the government will suffer from a financial deficit. Poor guys will not have as good welfare as now. Even US economy will be greatly affected, I believe. Then, in a short time, maybe some Americans will be easier to find a job. But in the long run, most US citizens will suffer from US's fading.

As the best students, we can find the best job in anywhere of the world. Do you think we don't want to fight for our own country? Of course we do, and non of our intelligence and contribution will benefit US. If the government wants to be short sighted, sure you can. But everyone can see the consequence.
