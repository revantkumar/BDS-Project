Immigration is the basis of the U.S.A. It's no doubt that STEM workers were, are and will always be of huge demands. This forms the foundation of this nation's successful history in the recent two centuries. This extension will enable a great attraction to talented people around the world. This does not pose any harm to domestic workers because 1. domestic STEM workers are mostly not affected as there are tons of STEM jobs which requires security clearance and/or green card holds so they don't even overlap with Foreign STEM workers. 2. There are clear advantages of domestic STEM workers in language and they are much more likely to win the competition if there is one. 

I strongly support the extension proposal and firmly believe that's the only way to keep the core competency of the USA.
