I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S... If they use the knowledge to build their countries, USA will encounter more crisis in future.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. As you can see, the international citizen build US together. Equality is the core value of America. American Dream should not be restricted and destroyed by the unfair laws.

3. The competition in job fairs can help US to choose more excellent people, and raise the average production power of USA.
