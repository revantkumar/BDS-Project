As a recruiter, I find it contemptible that we are educating everyone in the world but our own. We do NOT need more foreign workers. They have no interest in going back to their countries of origin, once they get into a company then all they want is for the company to start sponsoring them for an H1b and then on to their Green Card.

We are importing people into our colleges and then short changing Americans. Then once we have denied our people jobs in IT and Engineering, we hire the foreigners that we have now educated. If you go looking for IT and Engineering resumes, ALL you see are Indians, and Asians. You are relegating our own people to lower paying jobs. We have MORE than enough people here who can be trained for these roles.

Stop the insanity.
