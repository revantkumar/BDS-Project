International students in STEM deserve better OPT and other immigration policies.

Domestic students are not deprived of their job security. International students are contributing! College and grad-school recruiting process shares equity among all the applicants and a lot of times even more difficult for international students. With majority of the local students all flock into business, med and law school in the pursuit of wealth, a lot of international students together with some domestic students still share the same spirit in science and keep that momentum all the way though years of hard work in their STEM programs. All these students receive equal opportunity of education and training and some already start to contribute within their program to the amazing science and technology that totally changed our life. And yet, after years of training and on-going contribution, the international students can't even secure a job to keep doing what they are devoted to, simply because of the unfair immigration policy.

What made America the super power and leader for decades? Lawyers, business men and doctors? No, America is where it is today because of the leading position in science and technology. That's why Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi get on board in the past century. Yes, it's no easy job and whoever is contributing in this realm should earn their reward and respect, no matter if they are American citizen or resident alien. It's no easy job and therefore there is not a lot of openings that could raise the concern as a 'job market competition'at all. However, if the tighten immigration policy keeps driving disappointed talents away, soon will we witness the looming of a new era, an era where America is delisted from the superpower club.

Thank you for your support on STEM OPT extension proposal and GOD BLESS AMERICA!
