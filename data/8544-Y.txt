I strongly agree with the approval of this plan. The foundatition of the United States of America is the freedom, allowing hundreds of thousands of immigrants doing what they are good at. This has never been changed for two hundred years, which also has made USA the top country in the world. I don't want to see the elimination of the competition, since the freedom to compete has always been the reason why USA becomes a powerful country.
