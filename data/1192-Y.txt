I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S..

2. Diversity is veryimportant for the U.S. There are a lot of famous people that made great contribution to U.S. Was international student.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. International students is not competing with lower pay. Actually, many jobs can not find a good fit in U.S. Students. This kind of competition can help US to better educate children and improve their competitiveness around the world.
