I strongly agree with this regulation. I truly believe this is a good regulation for the whole society. There are three reasons for my view. 

First, the United States needs talents in the STEM major students to make it a strong country. It is obvious how technology could have a huge impact on the economy. Nowadays, most top companies needs technology. Technology can help companies in so many different ways. Technology can make management much easier with ERP systems, make communication much easier with phones and emails, make decision much easier and wiser with data available to do analysis, let alone in most cases, technology has became the core competence for many companies. I truly believe it is very important for the United States to keep its leading role in technology and economy. To do that, the United States needs talents. 

Second, the United States has a long immigration history, people from different cultures to work together to really think of good ideas, to work out really different problems is what makes the United States what it is today. I don't believe being harsh on the people that could really make a difference is a wise decision. 

Third, as this regulation mentioned, it would make the US university more competitive in the world. It is very important to have the best university in the world, because that is the future of the society. Having those talented people in the same place would achieve many meaningful goals, say having ground breaking research results in technology, medical, science, etc. This could really make the world a better place.

It is tough for those F1 students to find a job in the US. It is a highly competitive market, a low probability to find a job here, let alone stay in the US. However, if a talent is needed, is hired despite all the difficulty, I think it would be fair to let them spend the most precious time in their life in the United States, to work really hard, and truly make a difference.
