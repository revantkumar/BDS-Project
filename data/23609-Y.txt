I support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. 

I personally work for a large high tech company in silicon valley while leading a vital position in engineering department. Before that, I was a phd student at a prestigious private school in the east coast. I earned full scholarship in my graduate school and I feel very grateful for what this country have offered me. Even now, I am fully contributing myself to the company's revenue growth thanks to the previous past five years in graduate school. I don't understand what is going on here if I the country decided to send me out of country without giving me a chance to pay back? Well, I can possibly lead a better life somewhere else, but I am just wondering if the country will not regret doing so?
