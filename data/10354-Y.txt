This proposal would definitely benefit the states in the long run.
Most of the students on STEM extension have engineering or science background. The states need talents in these fields. The value created by these students would remain in the states, contributing to American economic.

Having foreign students working in the states does not mean taking jobs from Americans. Competition comes with technology growth. Technology growth creates more jobs. Jobs are created, not given in the name of protection. As the world's largest economic, America needs talents and resources from all over the world. Closing up the gate would not be a wise way to pursue.
