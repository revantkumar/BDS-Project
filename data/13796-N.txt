Enough with expanding these visa options. When we have MILLIONS of US workers out of work how can you possibly think about having more students stay here longer ? The obvious fact is that they will be taking jobs that should be for American citizens!! Not only that, but allowing companies to pay them lower wage than going rates is ludicrous. It only brings DOWN the wages of the American workers. When are we going to stop "coddling" foreign students as well as illegal aliens and start putting our economy back together by putting AMERICANS to work??!!
