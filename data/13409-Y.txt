This regulation applies to so many topics that have been debated by 2016 Presidential candidates and that have been in the national news recently: immigration, STEM education, US competitiveness, economic growth through technological advances, immigration, etc. This regulation, though minor in the grand scheme of things, addresses many of the problems that we face as a nation. The world is getting increasingly more 'flat' and interconnected- this regulation shows that the US is attempting to more toward a more inclusive economy by supporting international STEM students. 

However, I think that DHS made a mistake in including wages in the costs. According the the Initial Regulatory Impact Analysis, DHS calculates all of the potential wages earned by international students and includes them as costs to our nation. While I'm sure that some students earn their degrees, work in the US, and send all of their money home, that is not the case for everyone. These STEM students (and STEM workers) are, for the most part, contributing to the US society as well as the US economy. I just can not see how wages to international students (graduated international STEM workers) can be considered a cost, while wages to domestic students is considered a benefit.
