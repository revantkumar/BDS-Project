I strongly support this proposed. This new rules will help American stay competitive. Countries like Canada offer 3 years working visa to newly graduated international students. They enjoy the benefit international students brought. 

There is no any research show that OPT drive down wage. In fact, there are lots of research about how international students help the economy.
