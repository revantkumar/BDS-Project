Wen Luo I believe OPT extension is quite important to US.
1. Education is the fundation of a country. OPT extension rules attract millions of international students which greatly ease the financial crisis of US universities.

2. OPT rules provide the competitiveness of US IT industry. Except the fact that huge companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook still face the shortage of engineer every year, any deterioration in the duration of OPT extension will greatly impact US startup eco system. Indeed tech startup is idea drivien industry, but it will need huge amout of talented engineers to achieve and scale up the idea. A vital phrase of a success startup is whether it can scalling up quick enough. Without the OPT extension, US startups will lose the capability of quickly scalling up to occupy the market, which is the necessity of a unicorn company. I can imagine without opt extension Asian IT companies will take the place of US companies in 5 years, as Asian companies will have 3-5 times more US educated talented engineers than US itself.
