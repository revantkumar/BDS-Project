I strongly support the proposal of expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students for the following reasons:

1. By extending OPT, the International students who receive higher education from the US colleges and institutes will have more opportunities to positively impact the companies in the US and thus make contributions the US economy.

2. Competition for job opportunities between International students and US citizens does exist, but it actually has tremendous positiveness.
International students are hired by high profile companies, such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Goldman Sachs, not because they have a lower expectation for salary than US citizens nor they are willing to sacrifice their leisure time in order to work longer hours, but simply because they are better candidates than US citizens for certain jobs. Through competition, companies can fill each available position with the best candidate which will in turn bring the best products, innovation, and service to the customer. Consequently, the US economy will be more energetic and dynamic and the entire US society will benefit from it.
