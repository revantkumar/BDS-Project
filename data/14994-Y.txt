I strongly support the extension. Most F-1 students with STEM degrees possess real good abilities that are equal to or even better than the abilities of native Americans. They are not wasting the resources. Quite the opposite, they often contribute more to the development of U.S. tech companies. If you can hire a better equipped person, would you mind whether he/she is an F-1 student? And, if you want to keep the person you hired but he/she have to leave just because the working visa expires, what would you think?

Besides, we all know that F-1 students with STEM degrees are the mainstay of the medium and low level developers in tech companies in U.S. If they no longer appear in the companies, most support for the normal operations of the companies will be lost. I am sure U.S. government do not want to see the tech companies lacking workforce, while people with qualified skills do not have the chance to make their contribution. What is more, this can also affect the economy, as tech companies are also business. Therefore, I think for the good of U.S. economy and technology advancement, the proposed rule should be accepted.
