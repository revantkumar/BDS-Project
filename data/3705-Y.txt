America has always been a country for immigrants, well America was created by immigrants, this not only about F1 but at a higher level giving an opportunity to people who have proved themselves and came here and want to make something out of their life to have progress and success it's the main moto.. I am a student one insignificant person who has been trained and tried at every step in life and now am experiencing the significance of what higher education can provide... Well, if America can forge the metal... Then give some time to prove our metal... America as a country has evolved into a meaning... America in my mind lights up ... Opportunity.. Success.. Time to improve and apply.. Capability... Technology.. Gestation period for ideas to evolve. A person gets one chance in life... And if that chance is taken away so as just to prove the political mindset of the few.. Then thus would lead to a set back , not in a persons life but to whole generation of people.. And as my guide and guru said... People together form a community... Community forms a society... Society forms a city... Citys forms a state.. And. United states... Form America... These are my thoughts for a land considered to be opportunistic to foresee the tide of times and navigate in the sea of progress towards success... Not going into the specifics ... The person who is reading this will get the point... Kindly consider our request on extending the training period...after our studies... Let us progress together...
