Fan Zhang As a F-1 student, I am more than happy to see this rule being proposed. My major is in Computer Science and it is quite challenge to get a job offer in a top IT company. I spent a lot of time on improving my technical skills when I was in school, because I know the job interviews for the IT industry are not easy. After I have failed a lot of interviews, I finally got offers from company like Symantec, Pearson, and Amazon. I am very happy to see what I have achieved after what I have done for my dream. I work hard in the company, because I know I need to work harder in order to make my dream come true. Until recently, I don't know why there are people thinking F-1 students take over native Americans' job opportunities and want to even cancel OPT. 

I firmly believe those people are making the wrong conclusion. First of all, it is not easy to find a good job. I have experienced a lot of rejections until I finally get an job offer. I know the reason why I can get an job offer is I tired much harder than those people who complain a lot. Secondly, all the interviews I have taken is fair to all candidates. At least I felt the whole interview processes are fair. Graduated from a top university won't help much in the interview because the companies want to hire smart people and people who really contribute. Last, cancel OPT extension won't do any benefit to everyone. Because all those companies won't lower their hiring bar to hire people. The bar is still there, for those people who complains, if they don't work harder, they probably still won't find a job.

So, when I saw this proposed rule for expanding training opportunities and cap-gap relief. I am so excited because I felt most people are trying to helping building a better environment for all the people living in the U.S. And I do feel I am welcomed to work at United States.
