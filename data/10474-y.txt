Chenghan Zou I welcome the new rule.

I strongly believe that people should earn their jobs, instead of expect jobs to be handed over. It is ridiculously biased and invalid that some people are complaining that OPT students are "stealing" their jobs. First of all, American citizens have far more opportunities than foreign students in the job market. Many companies offer positions for American citizens only by simply not sponsoring work visa at all. I went to many career fairs during college years and it was normal that only a small fraction of the companies there would accept my resume. Furthermore, it is the same opportunity for everyone and it is natural that the best one wins. After foreign students apply for the job, we have to go through rounds of interviews, competing against fellow American/foreign applicants, and only get the job if we are considered competent and most suitable for the position. Foreign students need to work very hard to score a job and we withstand tests before we receive the job offer. People who are saying that we steal their jobs are just sore losers who wish companies would just hand them jobs because no one else can apply. Based on this logic, if they lose the competition to other American citizens, they would probably want to shut out people from those states.
