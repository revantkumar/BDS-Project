I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because these regulations improve the integrity of the STEM OPT 

program by encouraging students to gain valuable, practical STEM experience.By enhancing their 

functional understanding of how to apply academic knowledge in a work setting, students will be better qualified to embark on careers in their fields of study. These hand-on experiences would be obtainable only with employers committed to developing students 

knowledge and skills through practical application. Moreover, the proposed rules can

maintain our competitive edge in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully 

remain in the United States.
