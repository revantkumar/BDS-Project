I am strongly support the OPT extension for the following reasons:

As we all know,US has the top class education in the STEM area, but American native students seldom choose STEM as their major, this will do nothing good to the US economy .And I do believe that once the extension of OPT is implemented , it will attract more talented students from all over the world, which will benefit the relative industries.
