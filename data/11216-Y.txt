I strongly agree with the new OPT extension policy.
I am a senior undergrad student in China, and I think the STEM extension largely attracts me because it offers me a chance to intern or work in US technology company, which would help me to obtain more experience in my career.
If the extension is cancelled, I think a lot of students will not apply for the US universities due to very limited opportunities. It will affect the graduate students quality in the US and potentially harm the academy and industry.
I hope this new policy can pass and I believe it will benefit not only international students, but also US companies and universities.
