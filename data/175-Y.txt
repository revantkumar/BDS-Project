I do SUPPORT opt extenrion new rule. It's ridiculous that some negative comments say the wage of STEM students depresses the salary of citizens, for that data in recent years indicates that the average income of STEM employees is higher than that of others. The average salary from H1B last year is about 100,000 , while most of H1B visas are granted to STEM students.
Opening policy for STEM students promotes positive competition and stimulates technology development. If the OPT STEM rule is revoked suddenly, many talented foreign students will lose their chances to contribute to the US, and the losses caused by revocation couldn't be estimated. The US is a nation which is inclusive and progressive, thus its future shouldn't be confined by a few narrow-minded people that only consider their own benefits. Improving training opportunites is a better way to keep talented people in the US, and an important step to maintain US' first place in global science and technology fields.
