I strongly SUPPORT OPT extension, for the following reasons:
1. OPT extension provides equal job opportunities for talented employees. Without OPT extension, many potential international employees will lose their opportunities to work in US, thus, many companies will suffer a severe brain drain. This will bring severe effect to technology and economy development.

2. US is a country that emphasizes cross-cultural collaboration. For many companies, if they want to expand their market to other countries, they need to collaborate with international employees. OPT extension can attract international students and employees to US, thus improving international collaboration.

For these two reasons, I strongly SUPPORT OPT extension.
