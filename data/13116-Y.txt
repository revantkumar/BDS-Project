I agree with opt extention. First, They have high education. They create value for US. 
Second, their salaries are lower than US citizens when doing the same work. Company can save a lot of money. 
Third, they usually go back their countries after the opt period. They are highly knowledgeable people and they can create more value than normal ones. They even have a greater life in their own countries. They don't need to immigrate to US. We shouldn't worry about it.
