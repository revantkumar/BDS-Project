I support the proposal.
Think about how THE United States became the world leader after WWII. 
America absorbed lots of elites form other countries!!!
This reason also applies to present STEM students.
They devote their wisdom to American Companies. 
They pay taxes to service America Society. 
They help the United States keep STRONG!
