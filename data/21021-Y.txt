I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT policy.

For years foreign scientists and engineers have made huge contribution to the nowadays U.S. leading position in science and technology in the world. In most of the U.S. top universities, international graduate students are the major work force of STEM research. Without international graduates, foreign scientist and engineer, the silicon valley cannot survive for a single day. Today there is no more world war, friendly immigration policy is the only way to attract more talented students to study in the U.S. and contribute to the nation after their graduation. 

For those who believe international students take their job opportunities, can you take a while and think, why companies would spend extra money (H1B filing fee, etc) to hire an international student rather than hire you. If our people do not have the right skill set but blame those international students for taking their jobs, I do not see any hope in this country.

It is stupid that the U.S. government gave so many opportunities for those illegal immigrants to stay, but didn't do anything for those international students who can truly boost the U.S. economics and technology development. 

It is time to make some change to make the U.S. a great nation again.
