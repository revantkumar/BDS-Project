Yutao Lin I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension rule. I'm an international student studying in Automotive System Engineering for my master degree and interning at Johnson Controls as a complete seat design engineer. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to pursue my master degree in US, Canada, Britain. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. In addition, if this rule is terminated by some reasons, it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies. From my personal experience in Johnson Controls, I can feel there is still enormous need for the designers but what's interesting, 90% designers are foreigners and most of them are using OPT. If the policy terminates, there will be a larger vacancy for those positions which now already urgently needed more fill in. May be next finance crisis would start in manufacturing field with special labor shortage. 

I believe OPT is a great policy to solve the job demands and supplies in US and it also can contribute to raise the attractiveness of this country to show the world they welcome all potential talents to contribute themselves to US. Although this rule brings complaint, I think it is more advantageous than disadvantegeous. Hope this good policy can get broad understanding and support!!
