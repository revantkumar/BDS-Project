I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. International students are making great contributions to American economy, they are the best of best people in their countries. Nowadays more and more highly educated people are needed to run this huge economy. I can not say that citizens can not do it, but it would be a huge loss if you let those smart people go.

2. If the proposal can not be passed, it will affect the future international students, they pay a lot money for their education, so loss of students means loss of money. 

3. If American government let those smart international student leave this place, they will definitely go to American's competitor's land. It is obviously not wise to benefit the competitors. I think they will be very happy to see this happen.
