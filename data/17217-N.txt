With a record number of Americans having given up looking for a job and no longer participating in the workforce, the OPT is 
the wrong program at the wrong time. The government should not be subsidizing with taxpayer money the hiring of foreigners
who do not contribute to Social Security or to Medicare and, therefore, cost taxpayers and our elderly even more in the future.
The GAO has reported that the OPT program is not only inefficient and highly susceptible to fraud, but it also presents a 
considerable national security risk. Tens of thousands of foreign students remaining in the US under this program are not 
being properly monitored for legal status. The OPT is nothing more than an illegally expanded guest worker program which is 
depriving thousands of American engineers and technicians opportunities for decent employment after graduation. OPT helps
to suppress the wages and standard of living of our middle class citizens. Since the OPT is open to any foreigner regardless 
of ability, it cannot be argued that it somehow seeks out the best and the brightest. There is nothing about this proposed rule 
that is good for America economically or otherwise, and the OPT should be discontinued entirely.
