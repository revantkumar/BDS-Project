I would definitely support this rule because this will give a foundation and platform to foreign students. Students can get lot of learning opportunity and work for companies which indirectly improves the USA economy.

"Many foreign students moved to states and got settled". No doubt statement is true but let me clarify it. It is not because -immigrants are leaving own country for sake of dollars rather it is about fell in love feelings with states. And in future for this beautiful country we are ready to serve forever. 

When the root will be stronger the fruits will be sweeter.
