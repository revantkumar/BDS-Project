Improving and extending training opportunities for International nonimmigrant student is very IMPORTANT!!
The need for such an extension is specially for those international student who is able to employed by US employees. To hire such student, the employee needs to pay a lot of extra money for VISA sponsorship, and they need to pay the student higher than average salary to prove there is no comparable American employee who is capable of the duty. Therefore giving extension to such students is a way to make our country better, especially more competitive in science and technology. Most of those opposing this proposal, IMO, don't even qualify for these positions, so one solution is to use the tax money generated through importing better technical worker, and re-invest to educate lower-income people, not just closing doors for foreigners.
USA is a country built by immigrants, to import high-tech immigrant has much more pros than cons!!
