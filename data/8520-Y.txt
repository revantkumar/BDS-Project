Perla Alberthal I gotta say it looks silly for me not keeping those high skilled international students. Just take a look at the ratio of overall number of international v.s american at grad school. How many students would be left if there's no job market for international students and nobody come? We will have no way to compete with China or India in a few years in high tech areas.
