extending the OPT is beneficial to students, employers and the government. Students with OPT are more eager to perform their best at work place which creates more value to a company. Meanwhile companies with good amount of elite work force will in turn create more value to the country. I don't see why not extending the OPT period since it has no direct influence on the current immigration policy.
