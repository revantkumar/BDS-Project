I strongly support this rule. There are a lot of posts made clear clarification of the benefits that will be brought by this rule. And I agree with them. 
What I don't understand are the reasons that some people disagree with it. Some argue that this rule would cost some job opportunities that would have belong to a US Citizen. I don't think so, because this rule is for STEM students. A hallmark of the job slots of these fields is that the companies always wanted to hire qualified candidates. They are not likely to lower the bar because they cannot find one. It is not like a dish washing job which any one with a hand can do. So for those who are worrying about this kind of thing, my advice is to improve yourself and be a better employee instead of whining about your incompetence.
