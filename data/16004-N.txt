Why is the government promoting a new regulation that will result
in fewer STEM positions available to American citizens ?
This will benefit the high tech companies bottom line at the expense
of the middle class. We are in the middle of the worst economy since
the Great Depression with many Americans looking for work.
Homeland Security must help to promote jobs for Americans
and not foreign students.
