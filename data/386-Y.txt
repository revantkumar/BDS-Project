This is very important not only for those international STEM students' career development in the US but also for a lot of high-tech companies in the US. High-tech business relies on excellent students from all over the world and it is those international students who contribute a lot to the bloom of high-tech companies in the US. Therefore, I strongly believe that this proposal should be passed.
