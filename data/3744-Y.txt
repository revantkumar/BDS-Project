I strongly support the approval of improving and expanding OPT for STEM students! Take myself as an example, I obtained my PhD degree in statistics this year with 5-year research assistantship from the University. This meant the US government waived my tuition fee, around $25000 per year, and paid my salary, around $22000 per year. Therefore, it was the US paying a great amount of money to educate me to be an excellent researcher and equip me with the most advanced knowledge and skills. Now, I graduate and work in a top tier IT company, making the kind of contribution that college graduated American students can't achieve to the US and I am paying more than $40000 tax each year. I don't see any reason why the US would like to send away international students like me, rather than finding ways to forbidden illegal immigrants.
