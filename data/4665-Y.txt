I support the opt extension rule. I notice that some comments mention that this rule will let the companies hire international students over American citizens. This is not true. I am a student majored in chemistry. When I searched for jobs in the field of chemistry, the most of the openings require USA citizenship or green card. That said, companies, at least those in the field chemistry, still prefer USA citizens and green card holders over international students, and this is understandable -- hiring an international students needs a lot more paper work, and the company needs to help those international employees apply for H1B visa, which is extra expense. Also, there's chances that the international employees cannot get the H1B visa, due to the number of H1B appliers exceeding the allocation. If this happens, the company lose an employee and need to find another one. Another case is those companies/organizations are not allowed to hire foreigners due to confidentiality issues. For example, I know Intel does not hire international students as software developers. Therefore, companies always prefer american citizens over immigrants, and this has nothing to do with opt or opt extension. On the other hand, this opt extension rule will increase diversity in industry and academic institutes and keep them competitive, and I strongly support this rule.
