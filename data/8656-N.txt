The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers by allowing U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay thereby incentivizing employers to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
