Why not train more US born students for STEM instead of importing them. Our students deserve, and I believe, want that opportunity. Besides their parents have been paying US taxes for their entire lives and now their children's lives and in turn the students will continue that trend. Totally unfair to bring non US born students in before US born students. Try starting the STEM program earlier than middle school.
