The OPT program is bad for American workers. Do not extend the period that these stuents can work in the US to 36 months. Better yet, The whole program should be cancelled. There are far too many ctizens who are out of work and these jobs need to be filled by them. Also, this program costs Social Security millions of dollars a year.
