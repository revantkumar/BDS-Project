I strongly support the extension of OPT for STEM F1 students. 
12 month OPT definitely reduces F1 students' chance to get a job after graduation. Without the job market, which international student would consider apply for American university any more? They invest more than 100k dollars to university education, but receive a prohibition to job market. The 12-month OPT only help a few self-contemptuous citizens to gain a little bit more chance in their career path, but it totally destroy the American universities' income and reputation. Just think about it.
I don't see why this policy attracts so many negative minds. It does not make any sense so many unrelated people come here and say they are against the new rule. Please track the IP of comment to see if they are instigated by some people on purpose.
