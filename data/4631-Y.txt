The proposed OPT extension changes are highly appreciable. Students spend lots of money on their education in USA providing revenue for this country. Even though there is high currency difference with respect to other countries and USA, students still prefer USA for education as it is one of the top and forward nations in various aspects. Anyhow given the constraints of current OPT extension it helps gain knowledge, experience and understanding in their particular field. They should be given enough chance to prove them and gain expertise in their field. So 24 months of OPT- Extension is quite good time that would help them in many ways. It anyhow reflects an improvement in the economy of USA as people under OPT work for USA companies. So i am positive on this..!
