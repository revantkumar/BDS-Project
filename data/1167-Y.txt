I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. I am PhD student studying in Nutritional Science in a well known University. I spent almost five years in this degree. I worked so hard in the lab, never got a chance to work in the real industry or company. I do need extra time to get more training. Of cause, U.S. is a better place for international students from STEM major to get training. 

2. The government should let us who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let us keep making contributions to the U.S.. It's a win-win situation. 

3. Some Americans worried about to compete with international students. I would say competition does exist. But, it is also a win-win situation. Americans may work harder and prove their better candidate than the others.
