I read some of the comments. Admittedly, these students will occupy some job positions and compete with Native American students. But don't forget how US became the most powerful country. During the Second World War, U.S. allowed a lot of scientists from Europe to come to America. The U.S. chose them so they chose the U.S. too. Today it's just the same situation. A lot of STEM students have RA or TA, which means that these students are supported by Americans. If we don't give them enough time to stay in the U.S., we are forcing them to go back to their homelands, like China and India. if so, Americans just cultivate these students for other countries. So I really think we should give them enough time and extend OPT. If they are excellent,they'll definitely stay in the U.S. and endeavor to our country. If they're not so good, they won't obtain a job or not a good job. In this way, we can reserve the elite students to work for us while mediocrity go back to their home.
