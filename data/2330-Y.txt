I fully support the extension of F1 OPT period from 17 months to 24 months. Firstly, this is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. In recent years, international students are playing a growing role in high-tech business. Many real talented students have to leave because of short OPT period. This is also a great chance for US high-tech companies to hire real talented international students to keep the nation competitive in science, technology, engineering and economy. Definitely this will expand the business in the long run, creating more jobs for all people. Please do not be short-sighted.
