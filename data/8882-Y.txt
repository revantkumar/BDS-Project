A few reasons this is necessary, in fact absolutely critical to growth of America's university system, and a huge positive for students looking to make this their study destination:

- Encourages more international students to come to the US for education, without the significant barrier of educational loans and huge cost of education being an out-and-out blocker. Everyone knows how much the extra two years paying off loans helps, and one year of experience is quite frankly nothing at all for a good job anywhere.
- Stability and gaining positive experience in cutting-edge tech. Working for a period over a year is utterly critical to gaining any semblance of understanding of complex technical systems. 
- Honestly, studying abroad is a critical, time consuming and life changing decision. Most students who do end up studying here are not your typical low-skill, low-wage immigrant. These are highly intelligent, highly trained individuals with an extreme passion for what they are doing. They will go elsewhere, the US is a big attraction for now. Speaking from experience talking to dozens of top-notch students considering a foreign education, it will not be if this program does get revoked.
