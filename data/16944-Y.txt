I strongly support the extension of OPT program. I saw many comments saying that many American people can not find jobs because of F1 students, which is totally unfair to F1 students. First of all, American local people have much more advantages than international students. Not to mention the language barrier, there are plenty of companies only recruiting citizens and green holders. Only few companies will provide opportunities to international students and mostly of them are IT companies. Secondly, the OPT extension is only for STEM programs, because technology is one of the core competencies of a country and we need more talented elites to keep the technology moving forward. If you search on the internet, you will find thousands of news and reports claiming the shortage of STEM workers. If OPT extension is cancelled, I believe there are thousands of job vacancies and the downside of industry marketing will come immediately.
