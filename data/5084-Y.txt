Mayur Chougule I support F1 OPT STEM Extension to 24 months. We need to give the best and the brightest students opportunity to live and work in the U.S. All these students are paying 30% taxes for their jobs, I myself pay about $1000 + in taxes every month. We are contributing to the economy. Glassdoor had posted there were over 150,000 open jobs just in Information Technology in 2014. This is after 233,000 applications for H-1B. So even after 233,000 people with jobs in all fields that were applying for H-1B, United States still had over 150,000 jobs open. So we need a way to have brightest international students to success in the U.S.
We all would be able to follow our dreams with all the hopes we came to this country, in search of a better life while making the US economy better.

Thank you!
