It is definitely a good improvement for STEM Degree students can stay longer in United States and have more opportunities than before to work in United States.
Students with STEM degrees mean that they have had a good education in United States so that they can offer their talent and knowledge to help United States industry improved. Extension gives the nonimmigrant students the space and time to find which company and which area they can pay their efforts and make this society better. Meanwhile, some nonimmigrant students with STEM degree have already gotten their job in United States without H1b because of the lottery made H1b hard to get. So the extension means that there are much more opportunities for them to get H1b so that they can still stay in the United States and pay their effort here.
