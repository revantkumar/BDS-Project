I find it appalling that any elected official would have a passing thought based on this concept. Our country has millions of unemployed true citizens. Illegal aliens, that is exactly what they are "ILLEGAL ALIENS," should never be given anything except a one-way ticket out of this country.
The ignorant idea of providing ILLEGAL ALIENS with even the slight possibility of any employment is pure stupidity. Then, to have the low-life audacity of presenting a bill that would reward ILLEGAL ALIENS with employment becomes a blatant example of our politicians lack of education and moral convections.

NO NO NO NO NO TO THIS IGNORANT IDEA!!!!!
