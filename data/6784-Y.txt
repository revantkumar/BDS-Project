Shining Ren We are in favor of this decision for OPT STEM program. First of all, we got more chances to continue working and contributing to great US companies. Second, the US society will also get enough labor in the near 5 years. Last but not least, foreign people should not be treated as when you want them they work, when only a minority of people here want them to go, they will go back. This is not what a developed and great country like US should do and show the world.
