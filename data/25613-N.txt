In the education sector a teacher friend experienced the effects of importing teacher trainees a few years ago. Teachers were imported from Spain at a lower pay rate. My friend was forced to give a trainee her parking place. They were treated with more respect than teachers who'd dedicated their lives to the district for years. I fear that lack of oversight will have a similar outcome in STEM fields.

I'm all in favor of giving foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but agree that today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program. I'm afraid that employers are only too happy to take on less demanding lower-paid folks (saving 7.65% when hiring foreign students instead of U.S. workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program). OPT workers frequently hold jobs in the $60-$90000/yr. range but cost Social Security approximately $1 billion per year. This reduces opportunities for American STEM workers.

I would suggest leveling the playing field. Mandate that STEM jobs be posted for U.S. STEM applicants first. Documentation must be provided that an inadequate applicant pool is available to meet job demands before foreign applicants may be considered. Companies who cheat would be banned from using participants in the program.
