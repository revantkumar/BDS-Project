Just think about those F-1 non-immigrant students who come to receive US higher education. Most of them come from wealthy and well-educated families in their home countries, e.g. China, Korean, Singapore, Vietnam, Iran, India. Many of them just go back after graduation, because their purpose is contributing to their own countries. Some of them choose to stay in US, working for US governments, companies, schools, and other institutions. Remember, the higher education they received, the more money the US has paid for them. You know how much it costs to educate a PhD, right? If they leave for their own countries, the costs are in vain. We are not asking everyone to stay, because people have their own choices regarding their own careers, but we should at least help those who are willing to work in US with a higher education degree stay. Just look around, how the high-tech companies changed your life? That is mostly because of non-immigrant engineers working dedicatedly at Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Netflix, and so forth. They politely come to this country, politely get their degree, politely apply for jobs, and politely work for this country. Our society just needs them. The US just needs them. We need them!
