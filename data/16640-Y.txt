I strongly support the proposal. Most of those who reject the proposal are so biased that they even can not provide a reasonable reason. They just want this to be stopped and wait for companies to guarantee them jobs. In this world nothing is guaranteed and one should earn things he or she deserves. Most STEM international students are smarter, working harder and spending more efforts. All they need is a relative fair opportunity to be trained in industry and making some achievements. Companies treat all the people the same and hire those who really can do things. This proposal works to keep ones who do things to keep the economy growth of the country. Without the proposal, the country would lose a lot of talented and hard-working international students. Then who can make up for their contributes to keeping the rapid growth of technology industry in United States?
