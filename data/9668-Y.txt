Ran Duan I support the proposed OPT extension for the following reasons.
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them make contributions to the U.S.. These students can make more contributions to the U.S. in the long term.
2. Competition is not a bad thing. Many international students can compete with the domestic students for job opportunities, and this will greatly help the United States to select and keep more talent candidates. Such competition will help the U.S. to improve its national competitiveness.
3. According to the NAFSA, during the academic year of 2013-2014, many international students (N= 886, 052) contributed around 26.8 billion dollars to the U.S. economy, which supported around 340 thousand U.S. citizens' jobs (See URL: http://t.cn/RUOwpaE).

Overall, this decision would significantly improve the country's economic development.
