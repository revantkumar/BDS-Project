Sherrill Pecere WHY are we pushing the education of students in the STEM fields only to YANK the rug out from underneath them after they've put in years to achieve their dream and degree. I am APPALLED at the VAST numbers of foreign students we're importing to fill the jobs (as Disney has done) leaving many citizens without jobs for which they're trained. American citizens need to fill all of these jobs first (as long as they are qualified) before ever even considering a foreign born employee. If we fail to employ those who are born here, live here and are educated here FIRST, our country will no longer be the United States of American, home of the free and the brave!!!! STOP this MADNESS!!!
