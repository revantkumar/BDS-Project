First of all on behalf of all the students we would like to thank the DHS for supporting and expanding training opportunities for students. 

There are a lot of students coming each semester and the count is growing up rapidly year by year which is causing a high level of competition between the students first on getting funding from the universities second on finding a job once graduated. Getting placed in a good job is becoming challenging year by year. Since there is only 90 days of grace period of unemployment on OPT, students are tending to adjust on jobs and are joining whichever they are offered even though it is not that they targeted for. By the time they crack their target its almost end of their VISA. Therefore it would be very great help to the students if the STEM work period is extended from 17 to 24 or 36 which would help them to secure their dream job given extended period.

Please take this request into consideration and please judge in favor of the alien students who are facing hardships is jobs.

Also it would be great if the 17-24 extension is automatic just like OPT - STEM extension.

Best Regards
