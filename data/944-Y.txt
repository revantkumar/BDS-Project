I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. As a stem OPT student, I really appreciate this opportunity that HSD gives we all foreign students. To practice my skills in the cutting edge technology companies is a great attraction for me pursuing my Master degree here. I believe that it is a double win for the hi-tech companies and the foreign talents.

However if the OPT extension suddenly shuts down, both sides would face the great disaster. For me, I feel really unfair and betrayed. I didn't do anything wrong why I have to leave my current work and project? For most tech-companies, a huge number of employers who help to push them moving forward would flow away. How long could they recover from this?

In a word, the OPT extension must continue.
