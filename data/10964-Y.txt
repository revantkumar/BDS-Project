I am strongly support the new OPT extension rule. I am a product manager, we have many business with foreign countries and we need foreign students to build the culture bridge for us. 12 months is not enough to raise up a skilled employee. I think 3 years in total is reasonable and after that period we can let the employee to work in our branch in his home country with less risk.
