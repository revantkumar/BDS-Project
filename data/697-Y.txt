High-skill foreign guestworkers provide fuel for the U.S. innovation economy that the United States cannot provide on its own. High-skill guestworker programs, such as STEM OPT, help ensure that the best and the brightest from around the world come to the United States to deploy their skills, boosting the competitiveness and the innovative capacities of American companies and leading to the formation of new fast-growing American companies, which, in turn, improves the lives of everyday Americans and creates new jobs on American shores.
