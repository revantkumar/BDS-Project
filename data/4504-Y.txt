STEM OPT is a tremendous disaster for our local US STEM students. There's a major difficulty of employment for local students. We should get our thoughts on training/ helping local students to be ready and competitive in STEM job market, not expanding the OPT term and make the issue worse.

Please consider our concerns. Thanks
