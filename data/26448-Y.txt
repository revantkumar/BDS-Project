I think it's a great ruling especially for those who did/are doing PhD in the United States.
Students who have spent 5 - 6 years in the United States doing their PhD gets the same OPT card as those who spent only 1 - 2 years doing their masters. So it's unfair in a bit for PhDs as long as the STAPLE act doesn't comes into effect. (Note : Proposed STAPLE ACT of 2015 gives automatic green card for PhDs). So it would make a lot of sense for PhDs to look for more than a year if they don't get picked up in the lottery the first time around. 
Also, the sudden decision about scrapping this rule would have made a lot of students who are currently in OPT in jeopardy. It's a welcome decision anytime. United States give them an opportunity to study, so they should also give them an opportunity to show case their talent. It's not good on the US government to not just help them in the start of their career and for some, in their mid-career. 
I welcome the decision anytime !!
