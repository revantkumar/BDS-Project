Sai Kiran Donkeni I am an F-1 student pursing my masters in one of the colleges in USA. I came here with a hope to learn and execute my talent with the knowledge what i have gained in here. There are many students who are like me came here and spent thousands of dollars for their higher education. We want to get trained, showcase our talent and give our best. For all this to happen, students should need to have some time to spend in researching, training, executing and get experienced. Government should give enough time and opportunity for this young talent to showcase what they have got. 24 Months STEM extension not only gives us enough time, it also decreases the pressure in scenarios such as CapGAP period where students can be relieved and spend time in giving their best to employers. I Strongly support this 24 months STEM Extension. Hope this nation will never step back in supporting young talent.
