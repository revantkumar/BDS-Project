This is a compromise between high-tech companies and STEM students:

1. On one side, high-tech company needs to hire a bunch of STEM students to work for them, and this will in return, provides more opportunities to the mass of American people. Take Uber for example, many part-time uber drivers in Ohio can make about $3,000 per month, this is even higher than many full-time jobs.

2. On the other side, talented STEM students are favored by other immigrant countries. Canada/Australia/New Zealand are providing positive immigrant policies to attract immigrants with shortage skills (most STEM professions are listed in their Long Term Skill Shortage List). US is attracting the most talented STEM students from all over the world by its outstanding higher education, there is no reason that US reject these STEM students only 1 year after their graduation, especially those with US degrees and those who is already aligned with American values.

President Obama urges that every American starts to learn programming because there is over 1 million demand in the job market for programmers, while apparently, can not be satisfied by current education system.

I have to say that this is a smart policy to balance between the demands from high-tech companies and STEM students, if there is no other better positive policies to retain STEM students, I would stand for this one.
