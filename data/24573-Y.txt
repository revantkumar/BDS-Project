I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international computer entering student from China and currently working here now using my first year of OPT. Our company requires 6 months training, and then we can start to work, if there is no extension, foreign STEM workers maybe lose their legitimate working permission short after we do something actually useful, which will cost a lot of fortune for our company since they get to hire new people and spend half year train them again, and many project in processing would be delayed, that would hurt the economy really bad. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit US high-tech industry.
