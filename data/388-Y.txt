Helen Zhu I strongly support this extension. From personal perspective, the reason I choose US to study is US offers a longer period of training time. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.
