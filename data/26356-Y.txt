I strongly support this proposal. Here are some points I can think of:

1) Graduate schools and colleges will continue to attract more international students to study in US as US will give their opportunities to apply their skills to industry after finishing their degree.

2) Employers in STEM areas of US will have enough new qualified employees to grow, which eventually benefit US economy.

3) It will keep diversity for companies.
