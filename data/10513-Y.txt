Zhijian Song I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I sponsored my daughter to go to US for an Engineering Degree. Just like most of Chinese families, we sponsor our children for a better education environment to help them grow and learn. Even though the tuition for foreign students is so high, and so much more expensive than in-state students, we still would like to pay. The most important reason is US could provide the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So they can practice their knowledge as part of the education to get better jobs when they return to China. Without OPT extension, they have less time to finish their practical projects after graduation. As the foreign students' tuition sponsor, US will have much less attraction to us to invest for our children's education if there is no OPT extension.
