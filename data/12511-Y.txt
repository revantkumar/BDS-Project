I am studying with another 20 graduate students in Computer Science department, Baylor University. Only 5 out of 20 are Americans, and the left are international students come from Czech Republic, Russia, Turkmenistan, Korea and China. My school is not a special, it is very common in the computer science and engineering fields, the majority graduate students are international students. I am not sure why Americans students more prefer Bachelor degrees, one possible reason is that most international students who prefer Bachelor degrees will stay in their own countries. So this is more like a filter, the people who decided to study abroad mostly are seeking advanced degrees.

We are well educated and trained, knowledgeable and creative, and have a higher opportunity to make a huge contribution to ANY employers, no matter the employers are US companies or foreigner companies. 

Extending OPT will definitely encourage more such global scientists and engineers to stay in American and make contribution to building a better America.
