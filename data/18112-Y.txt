I'm pretty much happy and feel confident with this law that it has given me a valuable opportunity to develop myself into much more professional in work environment. For me I feel that here is a better way of life and more freedom of expression. However it is very unfair and lead a great loss to various industries if we only limit this law to students. It gives them a chance to evolve into a resource which leads them for various inventions and also to produce emerging technologies. This way they can also contribute their skills, knowledge, experience to this country. For us its like a new life here.

My only concern is that people with OPT face many difficulties while fetching their dream job or getting into their interested projects. I see many people who got settled down here while working what they are really interested in and most of them are immigrants and its almost like the united States has given them a second chance. These people contributed a lot in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math education which has enormously benefited USA to stay as one of the Greatest Country in World.This is only because USA has got the equipment and technology in such a level that most of jobs, projects, experiments and inventions has to be performed or should be done in USA. 

Hence I recommend that DHS should make this law much more flexible so that people in stem field can contribute more and in much better ways, which helps USA to stay top in many IT industries. It can also help to strengthen and improve the economy of USA.
