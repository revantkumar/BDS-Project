I support OPT extension without any reservation! This will be huge benefit for US economics. Indeed, it seems like OPT will "take" some jobs in the US. But don't forget, the international talent will significantly strengthen the USA competition ability and get MORE jobs for USA eventually. 

I urge all USA people can be together to support his great benefit rule without any hesitate.
