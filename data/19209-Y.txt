It has been reported that more than 90 percent of students in STEM programs at graduate level are international students. Fundings invested to research programs at graduate level are producing cutting-edge technologies and skillful researchers. We cannot make the conclusion that 90 percent of the funding are used to train those students, but we could say that the majority of the new techniques are realized because of those well trained international students. 

Well trained students from STEM programs will help USA to keep up its first place in related areas and turn the investment into profit only if those students are working at a suitable place. The expanding of OPT time can effectively increase the chance for international students in STEM programs to find a suitable job. 

Longer OPT time means international students can spent more time waiting for a suitable job than competing with US citizens. This not only good for USA's government, international students, but also good for US citizens.
