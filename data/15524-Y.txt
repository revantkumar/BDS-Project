Without those science major graduates, I am not sure US can maintain its technological advantage over other countries, especially. I am a Post-doc researcher doing drug addiction research in the US. The first job I found in the US is not very satisfied, the research is not interesting, If there is no STEM, I will just go back to China and doing research there. STEM is very important. However, if the people think that such great program is no longer important for this country, I, an foreigner, will just go to some place where my skill will be needed. I believe without high quality immigrants, in ~10 years, US will lost its greatest advantage.
