I strongly support the new OPT STEM extension rule. I am currently holding OPT STEM Extension up to January, 2017. I am doing research at Yale University. The abrupt termination of OPT STEM Extension in February, 2016 will disrupt or affect my otherwise smoothly-going research in a very negative way. I know I am not alone. The numerous foreigners on OPT STEM will lose their job in the middle of something important. It will cause loss not only to those employees, but also the employers in particular.

STEM refers to Science, Technology, Engineer and Mathematics. Those fields require a high investment of time and efforts. Students from countries like China and India may do extremely well in STEM fields thanks to the education systems of their home countries, which place a dramatic emphasis on mathematics and science. President Obama has articulated a clear priority for STEM education recently, but it will take some time to see the effects. In the meantime, outstanding people from all over the world will still be the main driving force in the relevant fields and contribute to economic development of US. OPT STEM will be the key to their staying in US.

Some people are afraid that foreigners take away jobs from the US citizens. There is indeed a competition in the job market. As long as it is not malicious, we have every reason to believe that competition results in enthusiasm, productivity, efficiency and innovation, which creates more jobs as a result.

There may be some inefficiencies associated with the current OPT program. But it is not wise to throw out the baby with the bathwater. The new OPT STEM extension, like a new life, should be welcomed with open arms. I believe it will benefit the US economy in the long run.
