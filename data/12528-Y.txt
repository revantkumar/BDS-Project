Dear ICEB,

I strongly agree with F-1 STEM OPT extension.

I am a software engineer working in an IT company, holding an F-1 Visa. Here I would say that we so-called 'foreigners' aren't stealing job opportunities from native Americans. The reason why lots of foreigners got hired is because their hard working and can bring more benefits to the companies.

Opportunities of hiring in IT area are fair to each other, no matter if one is native American or from other countries. Every candidates are asked interview questions in the same difficulty. If I could say, native American even have slightly advantage to foreigners: first, a natural advantage in communication; second, a lower cost of hiring because they don't need sponsorship. 

However, given these fact, foreigners, especially foreign engineers in my area, are still popular in quite a few companies. This is because of their hard working and smartness. This hard working and smartness brings more benefits to companies then its extra cost, and more talents to this country, which I think is only beneficial to America.

I saw some comments posted complaining about cheap labor force from foreign countries in IT area stealing working opportunities from native Americans. I admit that there are such as Indian consulting companies, luring foreign students using F-1/H1B support and sell their labor force to other companies. And I truly think this is unfair to everybody. But such phenomenon should not be a strong reason to stop OPT extension. There should be extra rules to restrict unfair price labor force breaking employment balances.

Thanks
