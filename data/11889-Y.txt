The historical data has demonstrated that F1 students made non-negligible contribution to the development of the US economy and OPT extension will be undoubtedly a key to guarantee the healthy development of US economy. If the extension of OPT for STEM students cannot be approved, the downside is that a lot of US firms will be significantly affected. They couldn't find the right people to take over the job left by the employees with F1 VISA immediately. Meanwhile, they spent tons of money on training the F1 students and shaping them into the way they wanted. These employee s with a lot of profession skills were able to take over any challenging job and just started to earn money for their companies. However, guess what? They have to leave their job one year later due to no extension to the OPT. The firms will have to recruit a new employee and spend money on training them again. Think about it. Undoubtedly, it will be a great loss to the firms and employees. 
Yeah, maybe some people think the firms can originally look for a citizen to take this job. However, the fact is that US have a huge need for the STEM students. The prime career choice for the majority of the Americans is lawyer, doctor, finance, or accounting. The proportion of pursuing a STEM degree is relatively low. That's why President Obama appealed to the US kids to study in the STEM. It was known that the US economy is getting better and recovering. This need for STEM students will be stronger and stronger. In this scenario, I believe the extension to STEM is necessary. 
All of the F1 Students have a bachelor's or even higher degree and accepted tons of professional training. They are well-trained and ready to take any challenging tasks. Compared with illegal immigrant's immigration bill, I think it is more worthwhile to approve the extension to the OPT of STEM students.
