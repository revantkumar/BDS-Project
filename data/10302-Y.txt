I think this OPT extension is quite reasonable. International students majored in science and technology are making considerable contributions to the related fields, and also the US economy. They are more or less the majority in the graduate school. Two years' OPT extension would definitely help those students prepare their next step in life. And they may just temporally stay in US, gain more experience in their field, and seek more job opportunities oversea. I support this extension due to their huge contributions to the community.
