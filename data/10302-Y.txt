Herbert Napora Why is DHS in the business of giving American Jobs to foreign nationals? This policy should be opposed and stopped immediately. Politicians and Bureaucrats in Washington are out of touch with the American People. Stop! I repeat Stop giving American Jobs to foreign nationals. Bureaucrats are putting the American Middle Class and their children in jeopardy when it comes to employment. Train Americans for these jobs and future employment opportunities . These idiotic rules are one of the reasons for stagnation of wages. The Optional Practical Training program should be eliminated as soon as possible. DHS main mission should be to protect our country and our American Workers.
