Steven Fischer No non citizens should be allowed to work in the US. Furthermore, immigration levels should be tied directly to the unemployment rate. American workers should not have to compete against foreign workers in this country. Companies are using these workers to pay lower wages than American workers. Its not just entry level jobs it si also higher paying engineering jobs. There is no excuse for this to be happening and the reasons are obvious, lower cost to companies. They win but Americans lose.
