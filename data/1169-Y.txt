I support the OPT extension for F-1 students. A survey shows that most companies with visa restrictions find it hard to hire enough competitive candidates. Most companies with these restrictions received far less resume during career fairs on campus. Most student in STEM fields are F-1 students and we need them to contribute to the US's economy.
