I strongly support this new OPT extension policy for STEM F1 students. 

With the previous extension policy, F1 students got professional training during 27 months. Then, those students who failed H1B lotto has to go back to their countries. They can get a greater job in their countries because of the working experience in USA. However, USA lost so many trained workers, and has to spend more time and money to train new workers who has no working experience. So USA becomes a training school for international students. That is a big loss for USA as well as US Economy.

As I know, so many graduated international students are working at big technology companies, such as Google, Apple, Amazon and so on. Some of them who has a higher educational degree (Master and Ph.D) are playing an important role at the key departement. For example, a lot of international students are working at 3-D touch department at Apple. American people are enjoying in the contributions made by international students.Why not let them stay here for US technology development? 

Because of all above reasons, I strongly agree the new OPT extension policy for STEM F1 students.
