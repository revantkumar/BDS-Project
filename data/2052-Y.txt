I fully support this new expansion of the OPT. Currently many nonimmigrant/international students are being trained in the US in the field of STEM, including a lot with advanced degrees. Their expertise will benefit the innovation as well as the economic of the United States. However, if no such OPT exists, theses students will have to leave US even before they truly contribute their knowledge and expertise to the US, which will be unfortunate. In addition, such training will enhance international business tie between globally as more global collaboration is likely to occur once the student return to the home country. More importantly, the extended time period will provide more time for the student to start up a company, which will very likely to increase the job opportunities for the people in the US. Lastly, this expansion will provide better gap for the H1B visa, through which eligible students will transfer more smoothly to the new visa status, which will benefit the US companies a lot.

On the other hand, because such OPT is still temporary training(up to 3 years), it will not affect the job opportunities for the US citizens significantly. In contrast, it will fill the gap on the market as the US economy needs a lot of people in the field of STEM, which cannot be filled alone by the US citizens. Under the new OPT, the best talents all across the world will be more likely to remain in the US and continue to contribute to the innovation in the US, which is of great value to the US. 

In conclusion, the newly proposed OPT expansion will definitely better benefit US economy as well as the diversity of US and therefore I fully support the new proposal.
