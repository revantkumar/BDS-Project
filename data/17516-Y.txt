I strongly support this proposal. What makes USA a great country? Constitution? Maybe. Personally, I believe the most important reason is talents. America is developed not only by its current citizens, but also by talents came from the whole world, that's why it became such a great country. Every country on earth is becoming more and more international, which is the tendency. If america refuse to do so, it may eventually fall behind. 

Also, to those who disagree with this proposal with the thoughts that H1B helps foreigners steal job from citizens. This is kind of narrow-minded and completely wrong. Foreigners can never steal jobs from citizens. If a foreigner is as skilled as a citizen in an interview, he/she will probably get rejected while the citizen will get the offer.

It's true this may make citizens more difficult to get a job in STEM if he/she is not as competitive as foreigners. But I don't think this is negative. Actually, this will only force everyone to work hared and learn more knowledge, which will benefit everyone eventually.
