If these foreign workers are SSOOOO... SMART, then why do they need training at all? This OPT program is just another scam against all American Citizens in a STEM field. These foreign workers are no more smarter than Americans. This OPT scam is just "made up" crap out of thin air so that big business can hire young, cheap foreign workers and cheat the American citizens, the Social Security fund, and Medicare healthcare fund here in this country because these foreign workers don't pay into it. This is a serious crime against the STEM workers. We don't need these people in this country STEALING VERY GOOD PAYING JOBS FROM AMERICANS!!! This is nothing but legalized theft from the American middle class worker!
