I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
The most important reason that United States attracts millions of international students to come here for study are the OPT policies. Among these, the OPT extension indicates an increasing number of international student studying in STEM major. Most of them wish to put their knowledge gained in school into practice after they finish their study. As is known to all, this country leads the world in science and engineering fields, so a huge number of workforce is needed. Those international students will provide huge profits to the country's economy since it is comparatively less paid to them than to U.S. citizens. Here the competition does exist, but that is also the key factor how the country becomes the greatest one in the world. This will definitely impel everyone to study and work harder, which will greatly help boost the country's economy. 
If the OPT extension is cancelled, there will be huge loss to thousands of US technology enterprises. There are still thousands of hundreds of international workers work on F-1 OPT status, if they no longer have the work authorization, they will be asked to leave to country immediately, which leave the companies the problem of recruiting new ones. This will not only interrupt the business but also will cost more financial input for recruiting. 
At last, we all know that one key base of the greatness of this country is diversity. So absorbing intelligence from all over the world will absolutely benefit all the people on this free land.
