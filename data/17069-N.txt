I am opposed to expanding the Optional Practical Training program.
It is detrimental to our American tech workers.
American jobs should go to Americans. America doesn't need foreign students getting our jobs. This program encourages
employers to hire foreign students because the employer doesn't have to pay payroll taxes and can pay lower
than normal wages.
