USA is an developed country, meaning that people of USA should also be "developed". USA has well-defined education resources, that's why students all over the world come to pursue their degrees here. And training is the best follow-up for the education. Training is very critical for students who just finish their study to gain experience on what they will do in the future. 
As to the immigration issues, it is not a problem. USA is a country constructed by people all over the world. USA is open and that is why it is successful. People come to USA for the good resources supported from people in USA, most of whom are not "native" "USA" people. If USA people never open their mind, the country will become worse and worse.
