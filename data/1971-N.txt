The US labor market is already filled to the brim with unneeded foreign STEM workers.
At the same time many millions of US citizens are unemployed a large number of whom were formally employed in STEM (Tech) fields but were made to train their foreign replacements.
This is an intolerable situation for US citizen tech workers who have found the career either untenable financially or who are shunned by the tech industry when they reapply to get back into their chosen field of work in favor of cheap indentured servant foreign workers.
It is worth being reminded of the purpose of the US economy which is to serve the vast majority of US citizens, it has no other purpose.
I attach a CIS report about foreign employment in the United States.
