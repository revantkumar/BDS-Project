I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal for the following reasons:
1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S.

2. Diversity is one of the key features of the U.S., Without the contributions of people from various kinds of rances, the U.S. cannot become the stongest country as it is today. It is just like Qing dynasty of China, if a country closes its door to the world, the only result will be being surpassed by other countries.
