I strongly support this proposal. Every year tens of thousands of foreigners employed by high-tech companies have to leave US not because they are not qualified or having poor performance in the company but because they are not lucky enough to get H1B status in the lottery to extend their stay. Expanding OPT extension to 24 months will at least give OPTers three chances to get H1B status.
