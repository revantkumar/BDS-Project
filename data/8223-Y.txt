Having relocated to the United States of America for an education, students seeking training opportunities right after studies should be helped and everything related to this phenomenon is based on the government actually allowing them to take up these opportunities. It has been shown on a lot of occasions, that retaining talent in the country fosters economic growth. For students graduating with STEM degrees, the expansion of training opportunities will not only help them, but in turn the country as well. Students choosing the United States as their destination for educational needs have always viewed the country as very welcoming, and I am sure that she will continue to be so, with this ruling being a very positive step in the right direction. I am sure that a lot of my peers would gladly support this ruling to come into effect, as do I, and I take pleasure in thanking everyone who has and will be a part of this ruling's success.
