I strongly support this rule!
I got my Ph.D. degree from mechanical engineering department at Virginia Tech. I am currently a CAE engineer at Ford Motor Company. Since I didn't win H1B lottery, I might lose my Job after Feb/12/2016 if the OPT extension get revoked. I know there are a lot of internationals like me in Ford Motor Company, who have advanced degrees but didn't win H1B lottery. If they all lose jobs, it would be a disaster for Ford, and of course the entire American industry will be impacted.
Most of us get advanced degrees and contribute a lot to the company. I don't understand why somebody calls us illegals. We work hard for our degree and money, we contribute a lot in the company, calling us illegals is such a prejudice, which violates the American spirit. If OPT extension is revoked, then most of us won't come here to pursue PhD and MS. US government want to keep those smart people work for US, or other country? Why US is so strong? The answer is this country has so many talented immigrants working so hard for it. If the OPT extension is revoked, I can go back to China to get a good job, but this country is screwed because so may talented people leave.
