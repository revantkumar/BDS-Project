I strongly support the proposal! International students , they need time and chance to contribute to the U.S. especially high educated talents . Extension will definitely give them support and help America be more strong and explore more products . This is a win-win to the country itself proposal in the long term. Just protected local by avoiding competition is so stupid and short-sighted method. Open minded and open to the world is the right way to be strong
