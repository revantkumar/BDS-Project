I absolutely support the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM opt. Many reasons worthy of mentioning. STEM students can continously boost the technological and economic development of the us. US has a long history of immigration friendly policy which makes the country strong and thriving. The dominating status of the us in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely owing to the contribution made by millions of scientific and technological talents coming from all over the world. And the diversity of the society is very important. Extension of STEM can also be helpful to make more and more foreigner students come to US to further their study. Then university in US will improve the education .
