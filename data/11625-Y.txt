I support the statement strongly. 

As the first reason, American spirit "Everyone has same chances." The equal of gender, equal of race, equal of background. Anyway if person who has highly abilities and suitable of one position, it has no reason to refuse them. To maximum development and production, it needs everyone's working-hard, no matter race, no matter major. 

Next, STEM non-immigrant students may have more ideas which natives cannot thinking about, due to different educational and living environment. Also, we all recognize Asian people have great mathematical education. Why should American no need their computing advantages as similar fields, and their working-hard spirit with patience? 

Last but not least, we all know the truth is like that lower salary for Chinese non-immigrant students to do harder work. And students still coming and coming. Why? Because their want to reduce families burden, they still want to be independence. But the traditional not the same, so their parents still care about them so strictly and hard. There is a gold heart of each students for raising selves, if more, care of parents. It is our traditional, we cannot leave parents apart, who do their best to raise up children without return all the life time. 

The main idea is that 24-month extension should be succeed. It not only develop Chinese or other non-immigrant students' country (but I know Asian ones more), but also support American, even worldwide. The bound of worldwide will be closer as this little change. Thanks.
