I strongly SUPPORT this regulation because all the talent hard-working people in my team are foreigners. I could even be happier if some lazy and arrogant native worker got fired. These people got higher wages but did almost nothing in this team. I don't see any point for them to complain about OPT regulation for F-1 holders secretely. That's on the contrary the reason why they can have this much money!
