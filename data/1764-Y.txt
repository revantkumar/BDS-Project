After long waiting against the court's order, DHS proposed a very effective rule that can survive for both ends. It can be helpful for STEM students as well as for the country's economy. It should be assumed that these STEM students getting helpful for creating jobs and makes a USA leader in the world.Because of the talents of these Science,technology ,engineering students; america is continuously heading in all sectors in the world.I support because they can create a jobs for native residents as well by their skills. I would request government that extension should be still need increment in time period.With the new mentoring programme it would be fair experience for all newly graduate students and residents. I also highly encourage that government should also focus on giving chances to those students who does extraordinary work in their bachelors,masters or Ph.D programmes. Those students who consistently tops and maintains their four grade point average during whole academic career, government should give them opportunity to stay and be helpful to develop a country's position and economy. At the end i would like to say that it is good proposal because america needs a real change in the terms of immigration and work authorization nowadays.
