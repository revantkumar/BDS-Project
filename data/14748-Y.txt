With all of the Citizens of the United States of America who are fully qualified AND who are without employment this cannot happen. As a Veterans of the U.S. Army, with technical college and trade school training, and over 40 years of experience in the Computer Field (IT) I find it completely incomprehensible that the people WE ELECT to serve and protect and take care of their Citizens turn their backs on us totally. I have been seeking employment since 2008 without success.
When I am able to "help" a company for a short time they are very grateful but still would rather hire someone that is NOT from this country because it is cheaper. They must remember that WE buy their produces. An example: I used to always go to Disney in Orlando BUT have now boycotted them because of their greed and lack of support for their own country.
STOP IT!
