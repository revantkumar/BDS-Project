I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.

I am a physicist which went through a very rigorous course of study. I did this to make above average pay and because a liked the field of physics. You allow these foreign students to cheapen the field and you lessen the rational for young American citizens to enter the scientific fields. 

The technological edge is one of the major reasons America is a leader. American citizens have to come first so put your efforts into getting American young people to enter the scientific fields.
