This extension is really a super positive policy for the country since companies are finally no need to worry they couldn't keep the employees due to visa reasons. For most companies who do not expect to hire an employee more than 3 years, they now have more choices in the labor markets because they now could hire international graduates without expenses and efforts on sponsorship. This will definitely boom the labor market as well as the economy in the long run. Great policy!!!
