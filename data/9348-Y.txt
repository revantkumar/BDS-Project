Alex Torstorsium To 99%( if not all) international students: 

You made a vow in front of the visa officer when applying for F-1 student visa and you promised to go back to your country after graduation. 

By staying at US and working here you broke your vows. 

Why do you want to work here? You should go back to your own country and work there. 

That was the vow you made when applying for the F-1 student visa, isn't it? 

I vote AGAINST this proposal and even suggest cancelling the OPT program so all the international students can go back to their own countries and work there.
