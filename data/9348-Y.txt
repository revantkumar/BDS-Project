I am against this rule. For 1). This extension will only put more american citizens out of job or make it more difficult for american people to find a job. Too much supply, too little demand, simple as that. And 2). Seeking employment itself, either OPT or H1B, is already a clear intention of immigration, while F1 visa holders should not have such intention (or their F1 would have been denied), why we are proposing to pave ways to encourage the immigrant intention for the F1 students?
