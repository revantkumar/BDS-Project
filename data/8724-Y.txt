I think there's lots of misunderstanding here in previous comments that many Americans blames low-rate unemployment and job loss due to the STEM international students here, well actually these STEM jobs and training opportunities are not destroying the chance for American tech engineers but instead create much more, and lots of them graduate from top university and have high degree and there's no chance for them to search labor hour work. Their contribution to the employers would give benefits to grow the economy and create more and more jobs.

So that would definitely mistake to turn down the STEM rule and export them to home. We need them and so does our economy. We will absolutely enjoy the benefits eventually if we all create our future and bring more diversity and innovation. That's what we call American creed.

Hope this rule will work out as plan, thanks!
