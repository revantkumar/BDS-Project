Nonimmigrant students should totally get more training opportunities after graduation.
Many negative comments only show the side of ignorance and fear of this country, which is sad.

Take two comments for example:

1. "It is abhorrent that the OPT program exists at all. And it is even WORSE that you propose to extend it! Citizenship in this nation is becoming worth less and less, to the point that being a citizen is worth nothing at all. Why be a "citizen" when non-citizens ARE TREATED BETTER??? Disgusting!"

The reason the citizenship of United States being worthy is that skilled immigrants made this country better and better. And citizens in this country continue compete with the best of the world/ Just to avoid competing with talents from other countries and stop attracting best students from the world will only make United States weaker and weaker. And eventually, no one would like to come to this country and by then the citizenship would truly become worthless.

2. "This is just another method of GOVT pandering to big business to drive down wages. STEM college students shouldnt have to compete with foreign students who will accept lower wages just to stay here. If you want more Americans to take STEM degrees stop giving their jobs away." 

Apparently, the one who wrote the above comments have no idea how much a STEM Nonimmigrant students could make after graduate. Many of them went to the best tech company in US and their salaries are within top 1% in this country. If you really think student will accept lower wages just to stay here, proposing a wage limit and rank job opportunists for Nonimmigrant students by salary and only keep the top one could totally solve the problem.
