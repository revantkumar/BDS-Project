I'm a US citizen and worked in Instagram before. I strongly support the plan to improve the training opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. 

Today I feel curious how could the cofounder of instagram Mike Krieger solved his visa issue solve his visa issue when he founded the company. Here is my finding from https://www.quora.com/How-did-Mike-Krieger-handle-the-visa-issue-when-he-co-founded-Instagram-company

"According to his biography published on the White House blog, Mike Krieger was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and moved to California in 2004 to attend Stanford University on an F-1 student visa. After graduation, he worked for a year on OPT and later applied for and received an H-1B Visa. In 2010, he co-founded Instagram (company). After that, in late 2011/early 2012, he applied for a green card. In April 2012, the company was sold to Facebook. " 

Looks like a former F1 students created a lot of opportunities for US. I'm not sure if voiding the OPT extension will stop another "Mike Krieger" coming to US.
