I think the extension is absolutely necessary. First of all, for those international students who are granted the opportunity to receive education, an effective education process and efforts are mutual commitments between the US 
government and students. And a necessary extend of working experience is no doubt a crucial part of this process and efforts. Due to the nature of STEAM majors, constructive working experience won't be achieved without this extension.

Secondly, the intelligence of these international students will largely benefit US economy, which is a major reason why the US government grants their education here. an extended OPT will largely enable employers to make accurate examination on their future employers and more effective decision. this will in turn benefit the overall economy.

Therefore, i strongly agree to the OPT extension
