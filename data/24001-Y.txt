I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..Skilled person are valued to the country.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S..In the history of U.S., many great people were once came from foreign country.They learned from U.S. and feedback to it.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It is not truth that many international students accept lower salary to do the job.It's because some jobs can not find appropriate american to take. Competition can improve this country's vitality and keep it flourishing.
