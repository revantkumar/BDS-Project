Dear USE government officers,

I am a international graduate student, I come to America to pursue my master degree in computer science. Because I think I can learn more than in such a democratic and free country, and every one in this country should have right to live freely. We are international students, that means we may be less competitive than local students in study or working, due to language, thinking or identity. But we are still want to be treated equally here, so I think this is our right to ask for more training opportunities. As we all know, STEM is not an easy field for us, especially we are international students. We hope to apply what we learned here into development of US, and also we hope to get more chances to prove ourselves as an result of being educated in USA.
