Rajsekhar Bakki I am presently on opt and working for a firm , I am understanding the functionality of firms also understanding implementation of knowledge gained at school is entirely different from work implemented at a company in real time , my project entire period is 3 to 4 years to build it from scratch and to release it in real time so extending opt work for at students personally I recommend so students can understand complete functionality in building projects till the projects get released in to market. This will help both students and companies hiring us and also increasing economy with new energetic workforce 

Thanks I request uscis to implement opt extension for 2 more years and help opt students to enhance their working skills
By working on complete projects
