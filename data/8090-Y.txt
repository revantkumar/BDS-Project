I strongly support this rule since: 
1. It's good for both US and students after graduation who need more time to deep their knowledge. 
2. It can help more universities to attract students abroad and increase the local economy.
3. There are many students who are smart and work hard for their own lives. By expanding the time, they can contribute more to US.
