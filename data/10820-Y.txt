As a young Chinese working at a tech company in Bay Area, I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT extension regulation.

Those training opportunities are extremely important to us because the currently H-1B application is proceeded on a lottery basis, which means there are more than half of international STEM students cannot get their H-1B application reviewed and approved. Therefore, the OPT extension period will be their precious buffering time to run the lottery 2-3 times, which largely increases possibilities of being picked for H-1B application review. If the OPT is rescinded because of someones are reluctant to welcome well educated immigrations to America, those international students are going to lose their chance to work here abruptly, which is pretty unfair to them, especially considering how much they have spend on costly tuitions here. They definitely deserve a chance to work here.

On the flip side, the OPT extension being cancelled will also be a devastating doom against most tech companies in the U.S. As I previously mentioned, I work a tech company in Silicon Valley. Around than half of my colleagues are new grad students on F-1. They are intelligent and work hard, making huge impacts on the growth of our company. Most of them are still relying on the OPT as their valid immigration status. If the OPT extension will be unfortunately determined as illegal, in theory they have to leave America very soon. I cannot image how my company would possibly function suddenly losing those employees. I believe most of other tech companies have the very similar situations. So the new OPT extension regulation is also extremely crucial to virtually all tech companies in the U.S.

All in all, I really hope this OPT extension regulation can get passed eventually. It will definitely benefit all international students as well as tech companies in the U.S.
