I strongly support this rule. US has always been the land of opportunities and that is the main reason why US is one of the leading countries in the field of science and technology. Providing working opportunities for F1 students through OPT and STEM extension will benefit both the students and also the field of science and technology in the US. For years, foreign students have contributed a lot towards technological advancements in the US and this new rule will help them to continue doing that.
