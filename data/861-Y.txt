Haven Shi I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Firstly, the majority of my friends study in U.S. are excellent person specialize in certain fileds, and some of them are better than the people from there homeland. I firmly believe they can contribute to the United States of America. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.

Secondly, students from their homeland always face with difficulties like culture, tradition, transportation habit, living way and so on. Despite of that, they are struggling to combine their knowledge with job ability. Therefore sufficient time is necessary for them to adjust before getting a good job. Also competition does exist, but we all know we can come through the difficulties and do well at work. 

So please expand OPT, students need time.
