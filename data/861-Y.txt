I strongly support the proposal. The international STEM students are contributing greatly to the US economy especially in the tech industry. It would be US's loss if these students can't get enough opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills here. STEM extension is not the same as directly granting working visa so there's no need for US citizens to panic. A certain level of competition can definitely improve the technology and science field for this country.
