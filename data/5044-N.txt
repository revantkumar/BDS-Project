I am writing to oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program. It is wrong to allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes. The incentive should be to hire American Citizens! This program creates an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over QUALIFIED Americans. We currently have over 90 million Americans out of the labor force. Why is our government creating incentive to hire foreign workers? Recent reports have shown that many recent college graduates are struggling to find employment. This is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
