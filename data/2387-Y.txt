The importance to make OPT extension is quite obvious. I do support the OPT extension, it even should not be only 24 months, it should be even longer. The reasons are as following: 

1.The most important reason to support this rule is it will provide equal opportunity for everyone is american spirit, we live in a society which everyone has fair competition and equal job opportunities. 

2. International workers contribute gigantic tax and great technology skills to move forward US finance. Without international workers, US government will suffer from great loss both technologically and financially. we cannot imagine many talented and great workers are going to be expelled from US within a shorter period. 

3. Companies usually provide at least 3 months to give students a practice, it OPT ends in one year without extension, the input for companies to training people, such as money and resources will be such a waste, if we could have a longer time for OPT, such as 24 months or longer, it will be pretty worthwhile for companies to training people. 

4. For those who are against this rule are more or less fair of competition, they are fear of themselves are not competitive enough to getting a job, however, competition is the biggest resource for the development of technology, industry and economy. Competition will make technology booming and grow on.
