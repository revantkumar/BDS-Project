I Strongly agree with the new proposal.

As international students, we are disciplined tax payer and the money we paid including the tuition really benefit the US citizens.

Additionally, with the high tuition we paid, the universities can make better operations, including hire more elite professors, the better facilities, which will benefit the US students. It is a win-win situation. Why not put the proposal into practice?
