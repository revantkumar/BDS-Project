Qian Du I support the extension because it benefit not only F-1 students, but also technology companies and the whole US society. First, universities and institutes spent a large amount of money and resource on education of these STEM students. It will be a big waste if these students only contribute the first year after graduation, which is the period of time with least working experience. Instead, two years and even longer OPTs are sure to bring valuable returns to companies and society. 
Second, US leads the world innovation, which greatly relies on the "smartest brains" from all over the world. Short OPT will limit the contributions these smart brains can bring, and more importantly make US less attractive for those talented potential F1 students who are planning going aboard. 
Third, STEM F1 students are usually the top students in their home country--that is how they get the opportunities to study in US. However, short OPT make these talented students much less competitive when looking for jobs. It is unfair for both these students and the companies. Students can't get the best platform to show their talent and benefit the society, while the companies can't hire the best employees to accelerate their development. Putting together, all these ultimately will hurt the competitiveness of US.
