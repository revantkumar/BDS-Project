This administration is nothing but an American job killer. Obama won't enforce our perfectly valid immigration law, the borders are wide open (check the current Mexican heroin epidemic in several American states; ME, OH, and RI..to name a few). It is bad enough that illegal aliens are helping to keep Americans wages low, by working for substandard pay, and no benefits. Now we have another American job killing program that has Jeff Zuckerberger & Bill Gates written all over it. These billionaires are looking for cheap foreign labor, without any pensions or benefits tied to it. Of course they will stuff their Silicon Valley cubicles full of these foreign students. 

Couple this with the recent trade treay, which greatly expands and exhilirates the U.S. visa issuance to foreign workers. This is a disaster for the American worker, and our economy.
