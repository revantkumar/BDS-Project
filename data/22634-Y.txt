Thanks for guaranteeing that I, with my physics degree since 2009, will continue making 10 to 12 dollars an hour part time in a job totally unrelated to STEM while big companies continue to import foreigners to do STEM work, to TRAIN to do the work, and my taxes help them pay for it all. Thanks for representing me, the American Citizen, in all this. You are truly serving the pubic, uh, I mean public.
