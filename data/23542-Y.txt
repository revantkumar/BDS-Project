The development of American economy requires a large number of people with ability. International F-1 students play important role in the American labor market and have contribute a lot to American economy. The extensions of OPT time will highly improve the opportunities of being employed in American for International F-1 students and make contributions to American company. So, it is really a win-win decision for both American companies and F-1 students. Last but not least, the U.S. claims to be a country where people share equal rights. This rule can somewhat fill the gap between employment opportunities for F-1 students and native students. I strongly support this rule.
