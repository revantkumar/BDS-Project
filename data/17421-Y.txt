I am a PhD in science close to graduation and I need the OPT extension. Recently, I had an internship at a major international corporation, and have was offered a great research opportunity to put my knowledge in. I have applied for an pre-graduation OPT starting from December which last for a year, while I finish my PhD dissertation. If OPT extension is removed, it means I have no other choice but to finish PhD program and graduation before April so that I have the chance of applying for H1B visa. In Science, it is not a guaranteed thing to finish dissertation at a given time -- you cannot force your experiments to work. 

An OPT extension is crucial also because we graduate at different time, especially PhD students -- we graduate any time of the year. But H1B application is only once every year. Without the extension, student like me have to miss the once-a-year chance. On the other hand, my research project in this corporation is going to require a long devotion, which in research projects, are usually longer than a year. Like what my mentor in summer intern said to me: " we always want to keep employees for at least two years. because the first year they are just learning to walk, the second year they start to run, in the third year they can actually be a star."
