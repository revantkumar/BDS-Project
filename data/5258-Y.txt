In my opinion, the extension of OPT is totally reasonable. 

Firstly, working experience is very important part for STEM major students. So more time means more job opportunities, they can have more training on their major as well as service the US enterprise. That is a good thing! Both foreign students and US people can benefit from it.

Furthermore, this extension policy is a good example of American tradition. As we know, America is a immigration country which allow people from different place come here and struggle to fulfill their American Dream in history. For the foreign students who wish to have job in US, they are brilliants, excellent and they have dream to service with more American people. Why we don't just give them this chance, give them more freedom to change their fate?

Some people may worried about the foreign students would take off the job opportunities from local American. I understand but I still have to say that is no make sense. More high education degree people join the US market, they can give more power to the US economic. They make the enterprise more powerful at the same time more powerful enterprise provide more employment. And also, now is the global economic time, if US do not give them the chance, these excellent people can only return to their own country and server their own enterprise. Then this enterprise will really take off the job from the whole American people.

So in conclusion, i think the extension of OPT is quiet a good thing. I hope every American people may consider this problem seriously. And I hope this time US can still show our proud American dream to the whole world.
