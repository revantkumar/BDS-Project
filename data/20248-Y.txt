Keeping the OPT extension for potential immigrants would benefit the American workers that have the opportunity to work among and compete with the best in the world. 

The US has been a land of immigrants and as a proud American, I feel foreign students who become employees in US enrich our culture and economy. In fact, the first thing these students do after graduation and getting a job is to settle down, begin living well, i.e. investing in furniture, homes etc, which supports the local economy in US, thus returning money to US.

One of my close friends, a graduate of chemical engineering like myself, is an exceptional innovative mind that is currently struggling to maintain status as they have been directly affected by the vacation of this rule. I'm can imagine many are in this situation.

In summary, I wholeheartedly support keeping the OPT extension.
