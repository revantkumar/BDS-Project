I strongly ADVOCATE to expand OPT program for the following reasons:

OPT expansion will definitely boosts US economy. For instance, my best friend Yanwen who studied in US 2 years ago paid $2000/per month for rent. Plus, she consumed lots of food, clothing, gasoline every month. Furthermore, when her parents visited her in US, they spent $8000 for a one-week trip. If OPT expansion policy is cancelled, I believe many students will NOT choose US for learning. Meanwhile, they parents and friends are unlikely to travel to US often.

OPT expansion attracts best students in the world. On-job learning is probably the most efficient way to study new technology. Foreign students are unable to obtain enough practice in US which has up-to-date technology worldwide without OPT expansion. From my perspective, I would not like to go to US university if I cannot practice there. Moreover, most top students around me prefer to study in US rather than UK due to OPT expansion policy. 

OPT expansion will NOT harm local students. Take computer science as example, only a few local students would like to learn CS. When I was in US for business, I noticed 80% colleagues in IT department of my company US branch were non-american.Not my company is reluctant to hire local student but many local student prefer to learn other fields.

All in all, OPT expansion absolutely benefits United States from both economic and talent side.
