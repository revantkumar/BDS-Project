In short this will be a great improvement to current immigration regulations for empowering talent STEM students to better create their values in various industries in the U.S. without extra worrying about their identity status after school.

Lots of my classmates and friends are from STEM programs of universities and colleges across the country and are now working at world-knownly impactful companies, including Google, Facebook, Apple, and non-tech companies, that offer them a stable environment for them to contribute their expertise and skills to make their part of the world better.

With pressingly increasing pressure for H1B lottery, more and more of such talents face their post-school lawful identity in the U.S. much sooner and many of them didn't have the luck that they needed to leave the section where they'd been continuously creating unique value and to seek for other opportunities outside of U.S.

That's a lose-lose for both the industries and the students, while the irony is that this unwelcome outcome is decided ONLY by luck during H1B lottery.

Being part of the most major source of creativity and productivity for the future, international students capable of finding a job offer in the U.S. deserve the environment and immigration regulations that could help them better focus on their dreams, personal growth as well as industrial and social contribution legally and worry-free, but not against or even stop them from it.
