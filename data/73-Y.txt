When foreign students applied for F-1 visa, what did they say to the case officer? "Yes, I will come back to China/India after graduation." 

How many of them actually returned? I'd say less than 0.1%. 

They made a vow in front of US government and BROKE it later. 

With the expansion of this program, they'd take jobs from US citizens. With more and more H1-B workers coming, what benefits did it bring over to us?

I hereby vote against this proposal.
