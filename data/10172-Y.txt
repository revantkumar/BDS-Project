I strongly support this proposal because allowing STEM students to get a job could definitely increase the competitiveness of the United States. Many of nonimmigrant students major in STEM are playing an important role in companies and some of the job position could not hire proper American citizens and thus foreign students could be a better choice. Besides,allowing the 24-month OPT could appeal more students to pursue their degrees in America, which could also help increase the revenue. One direct result for canceling OPT is a great many of potential foreign students would be more likely to go to Europe, which I think, is a great loss of America.
