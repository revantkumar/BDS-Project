I would strongly support this proposal. My reasons are as follows:

1. Those who come to US to pursue higher education deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation.

2. It is absolutely good for US economy to have talented people working in STEM area. 

3. I've been well taught in my home country that "Everyone is born equal" is the key American spirit. But when it comes to job opportunities, how come there are so many negative voices that advocates protectionism? Please thumb up for this rule and make US a more attracting place for more and more talents in the world!
