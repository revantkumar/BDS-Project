I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S. If student are forced to go back to their own country without enough working experience in the US, a lot of international will lose their interest to come to US.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, a lot of great people especially from engineering filed are immigrants, like the current CEO of Google, Microsoft and so on.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. We are not mean to compete with most American people for those limited job, international students mainly focus on the stem field, which needs a lot of international engineer. We are not illegal immigrant, we have permission and Visa!
