I strongly support this proposal.

Foreign workers, especially highly skilled foreign workers are not enemies of domestic workers. Those people have contributed incredibly to the U.S economy and as a result, created better employment and education opportunities domestically. It is shortsighted to blame them for the current unemployment situation.

We need more qualified worker to help growing the economy.
