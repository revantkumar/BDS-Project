I am strongly support for the opt extension as long as 24 months. There are several reasons. Firstly, for opening startup during the OPT, it is highly likely for internation hires to create much more openings for native Americans. Secondly, most international hires are well-educated and knowledgeble, so they help to empower the States. Finally, experience during OPT will enhance business in the USA when they coma back to their mother country. In total, it is a win-win decision.
