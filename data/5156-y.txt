Rosa D I support the proposed OPT extemsion. This program including me attracting many international students in STEM field came to US to study. We got a chance not only learn the knowledge but also have some practical experience. Before I graduate, I rent a house with other students. The house and renting price kept increasing after the university start enrolling more and more international students since the year 2008. The rent is the only income for my landlord. I believe that the coming of international students help the economy. Compare to other countries such as German or Australia, the STEM program is an important reason that attracting those students in high tech field.
