Extending the OPT period for STEM students will definitely strengthen the innovative capacity of the US. Innovation determines the developing potential of a country. The US is the most powerful country in the world, because it has highly creative companies like Apple, Google, Facebook. Those companies made innovative products and changed the world fundamentally. If the US wants to keep prospering in the future, it needs to strengthen the innovative capacity. The easiest way now is to extend the OPT period for the STEM students. Undoubtedly, students are well trained in science and technology. Once they have the chance to apply their knowledge to practice, they will immediately make contribution the innovative capacity of the US. If the STEM students only have 12-month OPT period, most of them probably won't choose to work in the US. It will be a huge loss for the US if the most intelligent and creative people cannot make a contribution to the country.
