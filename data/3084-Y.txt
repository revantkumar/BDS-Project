I support the latest extension proposals on OPT and STEM. Let's be honest, most of STEM students become hard-working engineers if they find jobs after graduation. If America wants to keep competitive in this tech era, we need to keep them because they are building stuff for USA and for the world. Regarding the job matter, the STEM students are NOT taking jobs away from the Americans. In fact, all tech companies have plenty of headcount for whoever has a solid background in engineering. Disabling STEM extension helps nobody.
