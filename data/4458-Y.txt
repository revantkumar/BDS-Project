I strongly support this new rule. Expanding Training Opportunities will be extremely beneficial to F-1 non-immigrant student as well as the U.S.!!

Just take myself as an example, I major in project management, and to pursue a career in this area, I will finally need a project management expert certification, which needs two years full time work experience before I can actually take the exam. Before I decided to come to the U.S and study for this major, I actually have other offers from better school in London or Hong Kong, but after I studied the rules about how much time foreign students are allowed to work after completing their study aboard, I decided to come to the States because U.S. have better rules for international student. We can have a 12 months OPT followed by 17 month extension. It is what attracks me most. With OPT and the extension, I will be able to work and to get necessary training before I go back. Also, with my work and other OPT student working in the U.S., we can certainly create more economic value for this nation.

Besides, OPT extension is a very important method that the school used to advertise and get more international student coming, do not make that a lie by canceling this extension with no good reason.
