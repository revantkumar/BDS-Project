Song Han This is a reasonable rule and should be supported. 

The country is built upon immigration system. Except the Native Americans, all are from other countries. Since its foundation, America has attracted hundreds of millions of people all over the world. The main reason is that this is a country who treats people equally including those international students who just graduate. Only those most talented students at their homecountry can usually get the chance to study abroad. Their talents can create more job opportunities instead of leaving people jobless.They are, in fact,a huge source of chances which can make this country more prosperous. Therefore, I don't see any drawbacks in this rule.
