The "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief
for All Eligible F-1 Students" rule will exacerbate the already horrendously unfair and untenuous situation of all American STEM
graduates and workers. I am currently an unemployed worker with a Graduate Degree in Computer Science, who has just
been let go from my job which was paying what is considered a good salary by today's standards: $93,000. And this is the 
same salary I was making back in 2000! I am being replaced by a $60,000. recent graduate. My daughter and son in law both
have PhDs in biology. They are currently out of work, and the pittance they were making ($20,000 each) was used to treat 
them like slaves, with no worker protections or legal rights. And there is no longer any path to professorships for any of our
PhDs anymore. The market is so saturated with them that their only chance for a job in academia is to work as an adjunct 
professor for less than a living wage! This is an outrageous state of affairs for American workers! I can't believe you are still 
easing the rules for foreign students and H1Bs! Why don't you listen to the unemployed and underpaid American workers???
