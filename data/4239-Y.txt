It is a kind of unfair judgement on international students who have contributed so much to this country if the country still wants to shorter or lower their possibility to stay. This is the common sense not only in the group of international students but also in the mind of the people who really knows what this great nation needs. Our president candidate Mr. Trump knows this as well. 

"When foreigners attend our great colleges and want to stay in the U.S., they should not be thrown out of our country" Yes, of course Mr. Trump is serious about this tweet and so should everyone else. What will the students if they go back? The answer is simple: help to build China or India or any other future opposite of United States. The Bluebook published by Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China has pointed out that 72.38% of the Chinese international student choose to go back to China due to reasons like economic boom and better environment for startups. If we allow more and more talent go back to their own country, these people will build much powerful China or India, which in the future, would not be so good for United States.

"I want talented people to come into this country -- to work hard and to become citizens. Silicon Valley needs engineers, etc." Yes, Mr. Trump is once again correct as Silicon Valley is still the Tech heart of United States, which need the talents to make it running. I'm going to be a Software Engineer in Silicon Valley starting next year and I do believe what I'm going to do there is meaningful not only to me, but also to the company, to California, and this GREAT NATION!

Thus, I SUPPORT this 24-month extension, which will benefit me, and of course US.
