STEM OPT extension will bring more technology talents to United States. Those F-1 students in the STEM program are top talents from all over the world who can make great contribution to this country. Many positions in the technology company need those F-1 STEM students because there are not enough domestic resource that are qualified for those positions(software engineering, data science, statistics, etc.).

For those who do not agree on this extension, they may forget what makes U.S to be the NO.1 country in the world. U.S is an immigration country and immigrants makes this place great. Immigrants are not here to "take" your jobs. They come here to help you to build a better place for both you and them. 

It would be even more crazy to let those ILLEGAL immigrants to stay but do not allow those F-1 STEM student to LEGALLY stay here.
