I fully support this OPT extension for STEM degree students and CapGap relief for all eligible F-1 students. 

The US economy growth slows down in recent years, but STEM related industries contribute approximately 55% to the annual GDP. To make the US economy growth sustainable, the US government should support the STEM related companies and enhance STEM related employment. With the OPT extension for STEM degree students, it will attract more and more young, well educated, and innovative people to devote into STEM industry, and help US economy growth. 

Those OPT students also helped the US companies to go globalization. Take Uber as an example. Uber's dramatically growth in China and India cannot happen without those international employees (under OPT & H1-b visa). Google just announced to reenter China market this week is another signal of need a great number of new hires with international background and STEM degrees. Give STEM students OPT extension and relieve CapGap for all eligible F-1 students can benefit the hi-tech industry, especially their localization projects. 

As result, this rule can absolutely provide STEM industry with more qualified employees, help the STEM related industry to grow, and increase the US economy.
