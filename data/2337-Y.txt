I strongly support the proposal to increase the OPT extension period for STEM OPT students from 17 months to 24 months. 
Because, Many nonimmigrant students with STEM drgrees will participate in US tech industries after their graduation,e.g. computer programming, medical intruments, clean and renewable energy, which will not only benifit US economy but also promote people's daily life. If the economy get improved, more jobs and opportunities can be created, for both American and those STEM Nonimmigrant students. Then, why not!
