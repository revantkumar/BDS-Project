I strongly support this rule that extend the OPT, for the following reasons:
1. As a web developer, I deeply feel that people from different place have various innovative ideas, which helps us to develop better products to serve the country and improve people's life quality. Foreign talented people deserve time to chance to make contributions in America.
2. Foreign talented people can help America build more tight relationship with the countries they came from. Meanwhile, companies can have more potential chance to extend their business overseas, which boost the American economy, thus further generate more jobs.
