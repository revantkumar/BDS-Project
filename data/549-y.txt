Guanjie Xu, North Carolina State University I am a Chinese and earned my PH.D. degree inUS. I would like to have some comments on this policy for immigrants:
1. Immigrants, especially those have higher education and highly trained skills should be welcomed, because they will bring new drive power for the economy. In the long run, they will directly or indirectly create more opportunities rather than rob the working opportunities for the America.

2. If anyone who is familiar with American history, will see that America benefits a lot from immigrants. The positive role of immigrants, especially those with good education and high skills. 

3. We, human being, should unite rather than separate. We are the same species evoluted from the same ancestors. We should take care of each other. This spirit will surely drive the development of human society more. Globalization is the unrisistable trend with the internet application. This policy will give America more diversity and benifit America companys and economy during the globalization.
