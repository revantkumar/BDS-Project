Krishna Teja Kandhibanda I support the new STEM extension rule.

The support and improvement on STEM extension, really is a good decision made by DHS. This helps lot of upcoming foreign students to invest their time and money in arriving to USA for studying. 
All the foreign students put lot of effort and money for their studies in USA will be beneficial with this rule. This rule helps a student by giving him/her enough amount of time to show their impact for growth of the company they are working, in their respective fields. 

This new improved rule make many students to prefer USA rather than other countries which benefits both, country and the students. This rule helps thousands of student who are currently in OPT and also studying in various universities to concentrate more on studies and their work than worrying about their visa issues. And america is a land of opportunities and this new rule shows that it is giving equal opportunities to all the people who live and come for studies in USA.
