which lists all the consultancies that most international students go to. These consultancies market students with fake resume and fake experience to arrange for temporary jobs that pay below the market wages. If the OPT extension is allowed then there will be rise in more international students going to consultancies, and flooding the already crowded H1B applications. 

I sincerely request DHS and USCIS investigate companies like ConsultAdd, Codeforce, VST Consulting, Cintel etc. who absorb STEM graduates, flood the market with fake resume thus lowering the overall wages. 

Close to 900,000 international students come ever year with over 40% in STEM courses. Are you telling me all these 360,000 students are super-talented that no American can do the job? Which country in the world allows the International Students to stay in the country for 3 years under the guise of "training"? While I understand students should be allowed 3-4 months time to find jobs after graduation, but anything beyond that will pit foreign students against the local population in job market, which will bring wages down. DHS and USCIS should be careful in making rules to the detriment of Americans.
