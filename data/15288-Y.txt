This is ABSOLUTELY a good news for international students, and I strongly support it. Back in the day when I finished my undergraduate, I got the master/phd offers from US, Switzerland, China, and Australia. The main reason I chose a US university is its open atmosphere, and the US companies' positive attitude towards international students. Without the OPT and its extension, I can see how the good reputation of US high-tech companies will be changed among international students. And also the universities that willing to collect talented people from all over the world.
