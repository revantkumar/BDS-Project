Meng Li I think the new OPT extension policy is to benefit all the following three fields: the US economy, the US employers and the STEM students. 
Technology has been contributing to the US economy for a long time, and STEM students have become an important part of all the tech employers of the US, along with many US citizens. STEM students are grateful to be given a chance to receive education in US schools, and treasure the opportunities to gain some experience as well as contribute to the industry after graduation in the US. As a STEM student, I hope to apply what I learned at school to the real industry, and make my own contribution to the field that I'm interested in. 
In a word, this new extension policy helps firm part of the foundation that US economy thrives on, and benefit everyone that lives in the US, receives education in the US, as well as hopes to contribute to the industry. I'm totally in support of it!
