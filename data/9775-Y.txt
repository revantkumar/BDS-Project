Dear Officer,

I strongly support "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students". 

Students with STEM degree provide a huge amount of profits in United States' science and technology area. Take myself as an example, I and over 90% of the foreign students around me are the PhD students from Engineering at Columbia University. All of us will be devoted into the science and technology areas (Mechanical, electrical, computer science,etc) after graduation. We have been educated by United States with full fellowship from the university for over 5 years. We are full of gratitude to United States and we wish to pay back to this great country. On the other hand, science and technology have close relation with the country's development, macro-economics, general infrastructure, people's well-being, etc. It ensures all the other aspects of the country to function well. STEM makes the most important role in the country's GDP and enable it to rank number one over the whole world for the past decades. About half of the people working in STEM area are foreign graduates. If these people could not continue working in United States, it would result in an inevitable loss to the country.

Extension of OPT to additional 24 months could not ensure a foreign student to work permanently in United States because of the low rate of H1B lottery, but it makes the situation much better by enabling a student to apply for H1B for multiple times. With this risk, we would still like to take it and make contributions to United States, to thank to the education and financial supports that United States provided to us. We also believe United States could make the right choice to us.

Sincerely,
Xian Zhang
