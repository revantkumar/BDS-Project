I agree on the expanding for F1 non-immigrant student.
Students, especially well educated students are the most valuable for US, we are suffering the bad effect of low fertility for the past years, you all see what happened in the Europe, lack of high technology workers result in stagnation of economic and technology development, which in return affect people's welfare.
We should give the opportunity to those students who get very well American college education to build a better American.
Also as a nation of immigrants, it's in line with the spirit of the Constitution.
