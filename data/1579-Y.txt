OPT Extension would definitely benefit U.S by introducing contributions from people from all over the world. Welcoming international people to work legally in U.S after they graduate won't have any bad impact to US economy. Such a short period is only meant to provide international students a great chance to practice what they learned at school and how is that going to compete US citizens in job market? United States have always been an welcoming country for immigrants and I hope this time we are doing good things.
