I highly support this new OPT extension. I am an international student. The opportunity to get training after graduation in U.S. is one of the significant reasons why I came to U.S.. Otherwise, I may go to Canada or Europe. Also, there are lots of talents in the STEM program, who are backbones for many high-tech companies. Don't you think it would be a disaster to many companies, if many employees have to leave U.S. just because the disapproval of the new OPT extension proposal?
