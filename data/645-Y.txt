Roy Lettieri I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months ad longer. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities.Let's be a fair society and ive these students an opportunity to stay in the US and become productive, tax paying citizens.
