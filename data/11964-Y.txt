I strongly SUPPORT this proposal:

OPT Extension offers international students a good practical way to gain more experience in both professional and social networking field. Due to the globalization, more and more companies start their business worldwide. OPT provides the opportunities for American companies to gain both diversification and global perspective. 

Having STEM students to stay a little longer in America is a win-win solution for both America and students. The students can get valuable experience after they go back to their own countries. And America can get the students with high education to work and help improve the economy.
