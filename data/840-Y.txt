STEM F1 international students will NOT take away jobs from American citizens and drive down the wages. According to public government data, there are about 400k F1 students in 2014, compared to a total workforce of 33000k in "Professional and related occupations" (2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data). Even if all of them find jobs in US, it is about 1% of the professional occupations. It is IMPOSSIBLE that this 1% will take jobs away from citizens and drive down wages. 

In addition, most of these F1 students have higher education levels than college. Again, according to BLS data in 2014, the higher the education level, wages of foreign-born and native workforce become more close. "Among those with a bachelor's degree and higher, the earnings of foreign-born workers were essentially the same as the earnings of nativeborn
workers. " So it is so NOT TRUE that these STEM F1 will drive down wages.

In the end, I just want to add that these smart, hard working people are not competitors, they are creators of jobs. It is against the long, founding tradition of the USA to close doors to immigrants. More importantly, it is a stupid decision to send away these highly trained, valuable minds. They will be so helpful, even critical, in keep the US economy energetic and growing.
