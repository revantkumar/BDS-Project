Comments on Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002

Effect on American workers and prospective workers:
I write this comment as an Information Technology professional who has worked and hired IT trained US professionals, IT trained returning US Military Veterans and Foreign IT workers.
This program is open only to foreign workers and claims to be temporary followed by students returning to their home countries. It clearly represents discrimination against American students and American workers including those that have given up the search due to unfair regulations allowing hiring of less expensive foreigners by establishing standards in this regulation that allow all of them to be hired and thus displaced by foreign students.
o The length of time allowed brings this extension to the same as the misused H1 series of visas & allows the foreign student to qualify for H1 series visas. In the past, Disney IT workers and other IT workers have been displaced by excessive H1 series visas.
o The standards aimed at protecting American workers are so vague that they will protect no one except the foreign student. 
o It is essential that standards be strengthened to require both local and national advertising as well as us veteran job sites, the Veterans Administration job site and all 50 US state job boards, that are tied to unemployment compensation for that state, stating clear position qualifications for US citizen and legal entrants, excluding any H1 series visas, and requiring each position to be filled with a qualifying citizen or entrant applying BEFORE any STEM foreign student may be considered. 
o The hiring entity must also provide each rejected applicant with the reason for disqualification as an applicant and with a minimum of a 90 day appeal window when the applicant believes the company has not clearly proven that the applicant is not qualified under the position qualifications or that the qualifications were developed to only allow foreign applicants. Hiring must be frozen u
