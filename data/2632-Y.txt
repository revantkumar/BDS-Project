F. Previously Obtained Degrees

I have a concern with the 10 year limit. I believe it is to long, especially if they have gone and received a degree from a non STEM field. 

There is a higher degree of "catching-up" in the STEM OPT program that could occur because of the time between they received their STEM degree and actually working in the program. If a person received their STEM degree 10 years ago and have focused on another field they are not as focused or "refreshed" in the current research methods and topics when working with their employer. This could mean that a larger portion of the 17 months or 24 months would be a "catch-up" period and there would be a shorter period of actual application in the program and true mentorship, which does not further the purpose of the mentorship and extended time in the STEM OPT program.
