OPT is good for US and I support that. Most F-1 students are hard-working with solid professional skills and show impressive ability in the industry.Most students in STEM fields are international students. The situation is that employers could not hire enough qualified employees in these fields. And more often, employer need to first educate or train the new employees and let they adapt the working environment and the culture of the company. Having 24 months extension can allow them to make more contribution to US company as well as US's economy. If OPT extension could not be enforced, chances are that most F-1 students have to leave soon after they get to know their jobs.
Therefore I strongly support the OPT extension.
