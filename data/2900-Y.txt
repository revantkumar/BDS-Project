I would strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The US education systems have put effort and time on developing the F-1 Students' knowledge and background. In addition, it takes time and effort from the American employment company to train the F-1 students to be capable of doing things in their own field of study in the reality. One year of OPT is not enough to let the F-1 students have accomplishment in industry, since they, and similarly, American freshmen, would need half to one year to familiar themselves with the industry logistics, business mode, marketing strategy, etc. Therefore, it is beneficial to allow F-1 Student working longer in the US to make contribution to the country based on what they have learned from the universities and industry.

2. F-1 Students can bring different ideas or creativity into the industry. As a food technologist, I came from an Asian Country with my own comprehension on food and cuisine. When I develop formulas of food, I would like to involve the edge cutting international flavor concepts which is also what the marketing is looking for now in work. Some of the international flavor concepts were chosen by my marketing team as potentials to be introduced to the customers. In addition, more and more international flavors have shown up in our daily life, which cannot be omitted when you doing a grocery shopping for food.

3. Although there is competition between F-1 students and Americans, it might not be a bad thing. The competition can trigger the Americans to work harder and develop themselves better to fit into this environment locally and globally. Competition makes people know themselves better as a mirror. In addition, some of the open positions just cannot be filled by appropriate local candidates so that they are taken by F-1 students because of their special talents and expertise in field of study.
