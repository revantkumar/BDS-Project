NEW Yaqi I do support this proposal that we want the government will improve and expande Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 Students, as which could benefit employers in US.

As the non-farm payrolls data shows that new employment is up to 270 thousand people rather than 180 thousand people that is predicted by governments, we could know that America's economy is in a slow recovery. The Nasdaq Stock market driven by technology stocks plate also do well, which fully shows that the huge impact and contribution of the technology industry to boost the U.S. economy. As the economy is recovering, the need of high-tech companies for talented people is increasing constantly, and domestic graduates and post-graduates in US are not sufficient. If the governments were not to improve and expand the OPT, it would might be more and more difficult for companies to employ talented people, which will affect the recovery of the economy of US.

And then, the work of STEM requires the expanding of the OPT.
