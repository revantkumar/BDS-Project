I am studying in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I find that in this field, nearly 40% students are international students especially from China and India. So more dependent on foreign student is an inevitable trend. If the opt-extend regulation is denied, I am afraid that the US cannot afford the loss of the drain of genius and outstanding employee. Because they will become disappointed due to less opportunities of working, and the EE and IT corporations in Seattle and Silicon Valley must suffer more risk of a qualified employee with both technique and international insight suddenly being dropped out of a long-period project. If so, the vast gap of well-training workers cannot be block by native citizens in short time. Perhaps I am not knowledgeable of all the STEM, but IT is still a engine to increase US economy. Why not to continuous absorb high-level Chinese and Indian ITers into US professional system, in order to keep US competitive worldwide, as well as check and balance these two vibrant and potential rivals? I prefer to SUPPORT this regulation.
