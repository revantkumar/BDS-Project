I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 

1. OPT extension gives our international students more opportunities to apply their knowledge to this country, thus making contribution to the U.S. In addition, it will attract more and more international students to study in the U.S.. International students pay much more tuition than native students, this is a very big extra income for American education. 

2. The OPT extension proposal does not mean that those student would immigrate to the U.S.. For international student, it is also a good way to learn how to become more independent in a foreign country, which is a very precious opportunity in their life. After equip themselves, they can better serve their own country and obtain a better life.

3. There are thousands of international students get their jobs at IT company, they are brilliant and have high educational background, but only 50% of them can get H1B visa every year. If the OPT extension is canceled, the rest of these people will have to leave America immediately. This will be a significant lose to American economy.
