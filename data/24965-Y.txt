To my understanding, this is a beneficial policy for both those who wish to take up a preliminary job in the US, and for STEM fields' productivity in the US as well.

Nonimmigrant foreigners increasingly become a major contributor to university tuition revenues, as many come to the US to seek higher education due to the numerous high quality universities present in the US--a level of high education that is not available, might I say, anywhere else in the world. After receiving an enriching education, it only makes sense to provide a prolonged period of training for the graduated students, to then put their knowledge and skills to use to benefit US firms and their productivity.

Though one might counter-argue that such an influx of foreign nationals will flood the STEM job market and put unnecessary pressure on new graduates not on an F1 visa, I think this worry is not merited. Employers will continue to seek only the best students available. When new hires apply on an OPT, more new graduates for the employers to choose from can only benefit them, as a larger pool of excelling students is available to them. In other words, those who aren't 'good enough' to make the cut for a STEM position will continue to be out of the running, while fierce competition at the top will continue as well--just as it has always been. In fact, as I personally work in a STEM field, I believe it is the competition that drives innovation--if you don't keep up the good work, someone else certainly will become more innovative and advanced.

Finally, an OPT extension provides a good recovery system for the rampant fraudulent applications of H1B visas in the past few years (where naturally, some fraudulent applications ended up being granted the visas). In the past few years, there has been the case where an applicant would pay a 'cover-case' company to submit an H1B application on their behalf (such companies do not do any real 'business', just take a fee from the applicant and submit an H1B ap
