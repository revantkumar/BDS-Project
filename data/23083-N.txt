we do not need a stimulus or funding for hiring of foreign workers, they have stolen enough of our country. this is no more then genocide, flooding the nation with workers, while putting the burden on the cost of the American tax payers.we also fund your job.so if you make us all unemployed only to have slave wages, you too will be slave. so do not fund foreign anything and my so called entitlements would not be threatened if it wasn't for the foreign policy stealing everything from money to morals. boycott communism. how do you like china now, with the pollution, corruption, and poison. we don't need foreign workers there are not enough jobs here, this only another evil ploy to drop the wage and bankrupt the rest of us. tell the house and congress and the president to put the foreign policy in the domestic budget and lets vote on it.
