The OPT period is essential for the international students to further develop their trainings and skills in a setting that is outside the school. This would also be their opportunity to apply their knowledge and contribute to the society where they have received the education. 12 month is barely enough time for both the students and the companies that hire them. The student basically has to leave the job right after they are trained and ready to make significant contributions to the industry. 
I agree that regulations such as that the students' work must be in line with their major are absolutely necessary. However, a broad definition of "in line" must be considered. For example, a chemistry student could have got extensive experience in computer programing and data statistics during his/her research. Consequently, a job in the programing area should not be considered outside of the student's training simply because that is not the traditional chemical industry.
