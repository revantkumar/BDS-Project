I strongly support OPT extension for STEM students. According to a survey by KPCB in 2012, 60% of the top 25 tech companies in US (including Apple, Google, Facebook etc.) are founded by 1st or 2nd generation immigrants. Theses companies directly offer 1.2 million jobs, and also create many more jobs in the new fields they created. Tech immigrants do not take way jobs from Americans, but create more jobs.Therefore, OPT extension will be greatly beneficial to US society.
