Anonymous Students from all over the world come to USA hoping to get a better education and make contribution to the field of STEM. This extension will really aid them realize their dream as well add to the American economy.

For those who think foreigners are being favored, you really should try putting yourselves in our shoes to understand the hardships that we go through, and at the end denying the opportunity to make contribution in our field of interest is a huge setback for us.

Overall, this move by DHS is a good one.
