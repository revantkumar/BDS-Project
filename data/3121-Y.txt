I strongly support OPT STEM extension. Immigrant students have always been the crucial contributors in various technology fields and it in turn helps not just U.S economy but the whole global economy as well. With world moving towards globalization it is highly necessary that the knowledge across the globe be shared and expanded collectively. Students prefers U.S as they find a congregation of intellectual minds across the globe united for a purpose at one place. STEM extension is highly needed in order to make the world a better place.
