I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S., especially to their universities. Once they have to leave their position, their research might went into the dead end due to the shorten OPT time.
2. As a potential international student who should choose U.S as their destination might change their mind because the OPT time has been shortened. Many international students choose U.S as their study destination because they believe U.S will provide them a relatively good way to make contribution to the U.S. But, after shorten that time, they will have problem that they spent money on their studying in U.S and won't have enough time to make contribution to the nation. The number of international students will decrease. Soon, their won't be any Top international student staying in U.S. That's not good for the U.S educaiton
