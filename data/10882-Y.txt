I have a friend worked in California, but he has to leave USA recently because his visa is up, it's really disappointing that his American dream ends now. I really support the extension of OPT, it really will not hurt those native students, it actually will contribute to the economy of USA since it's only for the STEM major students, and these majors includes most of the international students.
