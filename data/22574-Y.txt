I strongly support STEM F-1 OPT extension.

As a software engineer in Indeed.com, I help people get jobs. And nearly 1/5 of my colleagues are the same as me, that come from a country outside of America. Every year we make huge contributions to our company that help millions of people get jobs. In fact, one of our director of online marketing is from another country. And I believe in years, many more people as 'foreigners' would promote in manager level. Stopping OPT extension would result Indeed.com, one of the biggest job search engines in the world, a huge loss in engineering effort, indirectly resulting low employment rate. As far as I know, other big companies in this area as Linked would only have more employees from foreign countries who may hold a F-1 visa. And stopping F-1 STEM OPT extension would cause a HUGE lost in job search area.

In my view, keeping F-1 STEM OPT extension would keep America a stable employment rate as well as a satisfying society.
