To someone that may concern:

I am an employee who is currently using my OPT to work and I am grateful everyday that I could have this opportunity provided by the US government. I learnt a lot and was hoping that I could keep my journey here in the Bay area as an engineer. Things may not be an issue if it was 10 years ago that after one year of OPT I could apply for the H1B visa and could most likely get approved. However, today the applicants of H1B are more than it could serve. This is the objective fact that I can not change. However, there are two facts that I feel it is urgent to extend the opt to in total 3 years for STEM. First of all, even with the heated competition in obtaining H1B, there are still some consulting companies in bay area who applied for several H1Bs for one applicant just to expand the chance of the lottery. I feel this is highly unfair and hope this issue be attended to. Under this situation, it is less likely that one can get H1B within one year. Once we do not get it, there is a large quantity of employees the company needs to relocate which is highly inefficient and expensive. With the extended opt, this will relieve the pressure on our shoulder as well as the companies. Secondly, it is widely known that most of the companies in bay area rely on the foreign employees. If they only have one year of opt, even the fresh graduate got hired, after one year they will no long be able to maintain their position and will greatly affect the functionality of the company. I always think that the most attractive mindset that the US government has is its open arm to the outside world. This makes you competitive and outstanding. Thus I highly suggest that you should extend the opt to in total 3 years for STEM. Thanks.
