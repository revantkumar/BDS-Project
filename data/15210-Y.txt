I'm a student currently using OPT to work. According to my own experience, getting a job as an international people is very hard. I don't understand why people are complaining about international people are taking over their jobs. When I first started interviewing with a company, I was competing with another domestic people for the job. All the feedback I got from their hiring managers and interviewers is that they prefer me over the other candidate since I'm more qualified for the job. However, the HR people decided to hire the other guy because I'm an international people. I understand that company are more inclined to hire domestic people over international people. The situation is already hard enough for us. Some racist people are even trying to get away the opportunity for us to work in this country for a short period of time. I strongly support the newly proposed rule. I think it will not only benefit all the international students like me, but also the development of the science and technology.
