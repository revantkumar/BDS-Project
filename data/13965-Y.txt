It is great idea to extend the OPT to 24 months and I am strongly support this. 

As a immigrate country, US benefit a lot from their immigration policy which attracts the most talent/hard working people around the world to come to US which make a great contribution to this country and it is called America dream. For STEM students from foreign countries, a lot of them hold a advanced degree ( Ph.D/M.S) from famous US universities (MIT/Harvard/Stanford), after their graduations most of them work in the world famous university/national lab as scientist/research or in a top notch high tech company in different areas. If the OPT can be extend to 24 months which means they can have longer time to work as a F1 since the working visa in US is hard to get now. If we end this program, a lot of talent student with awarded US degree might leave this country and it is not smart to see they move to Europe/Asia to fulfill their German dream, China dream or Japanese dream. We do not want the next Einstein/Zuckerberg developed their career in a different county not US. (Even they educated in US) just because their visa issue. If that is the case, the foundation of the America dream will collapse.

Therefore, people and government should strongly support this new regulation.
