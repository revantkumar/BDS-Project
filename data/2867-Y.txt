I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension.

First, STEM OPT extension is essential for better attracting international students, which will ensure that USA remains competitive in academic sector globally. With more talented and creative international students, USA will undoubtedly lead the academic innovation and technology revolution. 

Second, OPT extension will lead to more job opportunities to US citizens. Talented individuals from all over world will definitely push forward the advance in different industries, especially in science and technology. Thus many more start ups will be opened and there will be many more positions.

In addition, innovation usually requires much time to be realized, and OPT extension will make it more likely to happen. After graduation, international students can only work for less than one year. This is too short for them to get more insight in the specific industry. It would definitely be a pity that OPT ends when they are just in the midpoint of a great innovation in the industry.

Last but not the least, students with OPT extension will be more likely to expand the service of their companies into their home country. With OPT extension, international students can be more familiar with the service of their companies and how to make it better. Then when they come back to their home country, they will undoubtedly have the capacities to expand the company to these countries. Thus companies of USA will be more influential and competitive in the world.
