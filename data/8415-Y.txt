I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international student from China and I am an 3D modeler working in a 3D printing company right now. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, UK, Australia. The most important reason I choose to study here is America could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So I think OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. 

For example, I was going to United Kingdom to pursue my master degree instead of America if there is no opt extension for my major. Because compare to America, I only need one year to get my master degree. It could save a lot of money for me and my family. 

Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country. If this rule is terminated by some reasons unfortunately. I am sure it's definitely a huge disaster to most US high-tech companies because they are supported by a lot of foreign STEM talents. 

I think reject international students would gain American a short-term relief that there might be temporarily fewer competitors in the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people.
