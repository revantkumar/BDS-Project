Sunzi Mengzi I highly support this rule. It is a win-win policy that benefits both US industry and international student. But sorry for citizens who assume the rule may lower the salary and make employment more competitive. That might be true, this is capitalism country, not communism. You are not able to make money without contribute your full labor!
