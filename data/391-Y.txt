I am taking a positive attitude to this rule, and strongly suggest extending OPT to 3 years. 
First, the people who get benefit directly from this rule is the international students, who LEGALLY study aboard and pay the tuition ( 3 times more than local students). By passing this rules, studying in American will be more attractive than in UK or Australia. That's to say, each international students will not only pay large amount of tuitions, but also additional insurance, health care, clothes, food and tours. These will benefit the economy with no doubt. 
Secondly, after their graduation, you may think they could take the advantage the extension of OPT. DON'T MAKE IT WRONG. Every company will only choose the right person to fit the position. The market for international students is very limited. Because of the statues, they have to be very smart, well - educated and hard working. Even though, some excellent student were rejected by many companies. Why? Most companies have set the ratio of foreign labors. Many job descriptions are like " citizen or GC holders only"! They have to make sure the most part of employees are citizens or GC holders, because they don't want to become a H1B dependent, which will get them in trouble. Therefore, by passing this rule, it will provide a little more chance for excellent students to get hands on experience. 
Additionally, international students who have the experience on working in foreign companies, will be likely to contribute to international business cooperation. Most of the students are from wealthy families. With a well education background, it's much easier for them to get a good job when they are back to their countries. They will be the leaders in many aspects. They will be likely to cooperate with American companies, rather than others, because of those working experience. I think it will benefit America and Americans a lot.
