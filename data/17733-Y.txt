In decades, US has been the first choice to study abroad for most international students. One of the important reason is the 17 months OPT extension policy for STEM students. More and more elite students has been or are going to US for further study and contributes to US science and Technology, especially on fundamental research and basic industries, which are the cornerstones of the United States. If this new 24 months policy will not be able to be approved, many young elite students will choose other countries for further study, which will definite harm the Science and Technology of the US.

This new 24 months policy will create more jobs for this country, other than influencing the US job market. For example, the US keeps leading the world on IT, where the international graduates contributes a lot with their OPT extensions.

I highly support this new 24 months policy.
