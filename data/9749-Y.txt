I strongly support this. This is good for international students. This is also good for America. The high tech industries need many workers with strong STEM skills to contribute to the growth of the company. Some people said international students steal the job opportunity. But the fact is, all my American classmates can find a job very easily, because they have citizenship. They are the first choice of all companies. And companies are still looking for more people. So they choose some international students. Besides, competition is not a bad thing. No competition, no improvement. Last, we are working. We are working to make this country better as a foreigner. We contribute our skills, time. We pay tax. I believe this is good for this country and her people.
