My thoughts about this policy are mentioned below:

Institutions of higher learning are a center of innovation and crucial to the progress of United States. Many brilliant students from all over the world arrive at the shores of the US to benefit from an ecosystem that values creativity, inventiveness and risk taking. 

It is a great loss for the United States if such students have to leave the country, considering the fact that most of the tech industries are run by more than 50% people who are not americans and were once international students just like us. US have gained a lot from the talents of these people and will continue to innovate more if such students are allowed to stay in US for a longer period. Restricting their stay will only cause harm to US instead of benefiting from them.

A possible improvement to the student immigration could be strengthening student selection process in universities and the e-verify approved employer list. 

As a F-1 student visa holder I can say from my experience that a minimum of 3 years is required for OPT so that a student can spend a reasonable amount of time at a company to effectively complete his/her learning and for the company to gain in terms of substantial contribution from the international student.
