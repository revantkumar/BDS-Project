I can't believe so many people refused to welcome international students. Why? In my university, more than 50% graduate students are not American. Without the intentional students, I believe a lot of universities and colleges cannot survive. All the time, US attracted a lot of high-quality talent around the world, that's why US stay on top in the world. Refusing the international student, the students who can afford the tuition in US and who are good enough to get a job as a foreigner. All the other countries will appreciate you, you are doing what they want you do.
