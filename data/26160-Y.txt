I support this proposal, because this extension, together with Gap-Gap relief are reasonable and necessary for the training opportunities to international students. Students need enough time to practice what they learnt, and more important, our country DO NEED the knowledge these international students learnt at U.S universities. We DO NOT want to have the high-tech students get trained, and then force them back to their country before they could contribute to our country.
