Dear Sir/ Madam,

Please kindly take this into consideration that international students who are coming to your country are mostly the best group of students in their own country too. Moreover, these students are sometimes leave whatever they have in their country to come here by all the tough issues that they know they might encounter. For example, students from my country (IRAN) know that they will get most probably only single visa which means they cannot go out to their home easily and come back here because it has happened that due to a political situation between governments they couldn't enter the USA and continue their study. Another example, my wife and I has not left the country for three years because of that although we both are kind of homesick. I said this just to let you know that what are the situations for them and how tough is sometimes their situation but still they are working very hard here to help both themselves and as a consequence the USA. 

Sincerely yours,
An electrical engineer student
