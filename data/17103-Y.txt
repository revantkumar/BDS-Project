As a STEM major Chinese student in U.S., I do hard work and follow the rules just trying to live a normal life in here. Why it is such a hard thing just trying to stay in U.S.? For those people who are against this article, I'm studying hard and working hard to just stay here, and you can't blame us for you can't find a job. It's not us who is being lazy.
Please, don't against this new policy.
