I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1.OPT extension policy benefits academic sectors in US. Almost Every F1 student has different choices about which country he/she will choose to start his/her further education. The OPT extension gives them a great opportunity to earn industry experience after finishing the degree. Therefore, after considering the OPT extension policy, many potential international students will choose to start their undergraduate/graduate education in the United States, instead of in other countries where OPT extension doesn't exist. Therefore, the OPT extension policy makes the academic sectors in United States stand out among academic sectors in other countries.

2.I've found this paragraph from the proposal and feel it very reasonable and very correct. "As described below, international students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy." 

I can use my own experience to prove this: I came to Duke University in 2013 and paid nearly $80,000 for my graduate degree tuition in addition to other living expense. Now I'm working in California and I pay tax every month. Obviously I'm making great contribution for the economic in the US. The OPT extension policy make more opportunity for international students like me to make contribution to US economics.
