It takes time to make transition from a student to a professional who is capable to contribute to the employer. With longer OPT extension of 24 months, this transition can happen more smoothly and allows F-1 students have time and opportunities to create greater value for U.S. employers, especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics industry that usually have long project duration.
