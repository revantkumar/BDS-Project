An important component of what have made this country so different from others is her hospitality to people who are willing and capable to start a new and better life on this very land from all over the world. It is the hospitality rooted in her tradition that has made the huge success and prosperity of this nation possible. Over the last two centuries, there has been a long list of names of persons who made the world a very different place on this continent. A good policy that is aimed at protecting the long-term prosperity should also guard the continuity of the tradition and give talented people enough time to prove themselves in actual jobs. This proposed new OPT policy that can extend the stay of highly educated graduates to 24 months will give them that chance to demonstrate their values and create new opportunities for this nation.
