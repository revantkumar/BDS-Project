Ramon Argila de Torres y Sandoval Why not simply attach the wage provision of the law to reflect the hiring of a worker rather than the status of the worker? In other words, the fact of a person being hired would require the hiring authority to pay the "prevailing wage or their share of the 7.65% payroll taxes for the foreign worker," and therefore safeguard (ensure) Social Security. Such a change in law would negate efforts by corporations seeking to hire foreign workers simply to avoid paying payroll taxes, because the hiring status of the worker would ignore citizenship and instead attach importance (and tax status) to the hire, not the individual. Corporations would therefore have to pay payroll taxes no matter the citizenship of the worker.
