Coeus Zhang I do support this extension. It will benefit both the U.S. and the international students. 
I saw some opposite opinions, and their reasons don't make any sense if they have read the whole document carefully. DHS has explained very clear in the document. For example, someone said the STEM international students will rob jobs from the U.S. citizens. However, in the document, DHS has explained the rule to protect local labor market. Common sense also tells us if a company can find one with citizenship, it will not try to look for an international student to fill the position, because the company needs to do a lot of things to hire a foreigner. Another example is that someone said the STEM international students will decrease minimum wage. Again, DHS has the requirement of minimum wage for all the international students who want to work. That requirement for international students is higher than that for average local labors, so it will not decrease minimum wage.
