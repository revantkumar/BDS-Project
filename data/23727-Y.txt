I strongly support with this the OPT extension. 
International students bring money and skills.
According to the research of Alejandro Ortiz, Li Chang and Yuanyuan Fang. International students contributed almost US$27 billion to the US economy in 2014, which corresponds to a 12% increase versus 2013 when the total was US$24 billion. 
I believe that the extension allows highly educated students to have more time to contribute their efforts to the US industry. 

In addition, international students with different backgrounds bring innovative and distinctive ideas and skills to the US industry, and they are also helping to fill skills shortages at a time when the US share of the worlds science and engineering graduates is declining. The diversity is a critical factor to enable US technology make progress in a faster pace and to maintain its position as a leader in the world. 

As we all know science and technology are the primary productive forces to accelerate the economic growth. Its not hard to imagine that losing these highly educated students may impede the U.S economic development. 

In a nutshell, I never remain the suspicious of the fact that the OPT extension for STEM is beneficial program for both the international students and the U.S. economy.
