I support this regulation. I found a lot of people gave negative comments here misunderstood the purpose of this regulation and accuse international students for stealing their jobs. To me, the types of jobs that international STEM students are qualified are totally different with the jobs for those unemployed people needed. Net inflow of smart people with talents and specific skills is one of the most important driven forces that keeps the US leading the world in technology and scientific research areas. The OPT program assures that international students with talents and skills are capable to make their contribution to our economy. They are paid less but contributing more, which can increase the US's competence as well as benefit US citizens by boosting local economy and creating more job opportunities.
