I support the expanding training opportunity. Honestly speaking, I thought the main reason that company hires more foreigners is that there are not so many local people learning STEM. Over 80 percent of students in my class are Asian. Company hires more because they can't find enough local people. And most students pay for tax and tuition. For people who already got a job also need to pay for social security tax. My friends who already got a job, especially in STEM major always got a decent salary and contribute a lot to their company. I believe that no company would waste so much money on hiring cheap labor. The most comment saying that people grab their job opportunity also comes from some misunderstanding. I have to declare that it's some ICC company grab their job and got low salary. Also they take up too many H1B, which is also unfair for STEM students.
