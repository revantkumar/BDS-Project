John Rogers Why are we spending tax dollars training foreign workers when we have millions of unemployed? It is a well known fact the companies used these type programs to drive down wages and increase profits. Here is what Richard Trumpka siad about OPT:

"expanding de facto guest worker programs like Optional Practical Training (OPT) - through which employers hire more than 120,000 young college graduates per year who hold F-1 visas - but do not even guarantee that those foreign graduates are paid the minimum wage, let alone the prevailing wage, chase Americans out of computer science and creates a self-fulfilling 'shortage' as Americans respond to a relatively better market as engineers in other fields."

All the "facts" I have read in the press claiming labor shortages were written by those with an economic interest in a large cheap labor supply like the US Chamber of Commerce.
