I support the new regulation. Research has shown that STEM fields are the major driver for technological innovation which sustained economic growth, and a great share of students who major in STEM are international students. The Burden of supporting H1B has placed international students in an inferior starting position when entering job market already, and I think the new law may help improve their status. More importantly, it can stop our country from brain drain.
