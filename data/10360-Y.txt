I strongly support this proposal for the following reasons: 

Most of international students come to pursue their degrees in United States because they attach importance to this OPT extension, which makes them gain valuable experience here and make contributions to the companies they work for. 

If government cancel the extension, the number of international students who come to USA would decrease sharply!!! So the revenue gained from international students will almost disappear. As far as I know, many USA university's tuition are expensive, not every citizens can afford it. Where do those scholarship or fellowship come from? International Students' tuition. 

Therefore, If universities in USA want to gain more benefits, you need to provide OPT extension to International students. Or those students may probably flock into UK or European countries, which do not have any limitations on international students.
