My friend with a Cape Canaveral contractor had to train his own foreign replacement. Had a great job and was within a few years of retirement. He could not find another job and had to go on SS much earlier than planned which hurt his very badly.
An acquaintance I met at the farmer's market was getting trained at Harris Corp by an American worker that was losing his job too to this foreign worker.
Now this morning, Oct 6:55 AM EST, on Fox News an attorney representing a Disney worker that had to train his own 'foreign' replacement saying Disney was letting many go for these foreign workers.
Companies are breaking the laws on these type deals (OPT & H1B)they just want to make more money (greedy). Americans don't have enough jobs as it is. OPT and H1B need to be totally halted. PLEASE do not do this, we are so struggling out here.
