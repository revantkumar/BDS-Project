I think that the new OPT extension policy is absolutely necessary and would be extremely beneficial to not only F-1 students, but also potential employers and even the growth of economy and technologies in the US. 

Being an international student with STEM majors myself, I strongly feel that the extension of OPT is an irresistible trend. Nowadays, a lot of the research opportunities and projects in STEM field take longer than 12 months to complete, given the complexity and duration of typical research and engineering related activities. If I am planning to perform postdoctoral research or enrich my industrial experience upon completion of my PhD, I would definitely have higher chance of being accepted with a longer extension of my OPT. For example, several professors in our department have international background. If they had not been given the opportunity to perform postdoctoral research here via OPT, they would not have been able to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to a faculty member, let alone fostering talents and passing along the torch of knowledge. 

On the other hand, a longer period of OPT extension is also appealing to potential employers. Academic institutions and industrial companies can keep these talented students without having to worry about sponsoring their work visas and the complicated paperwork that comes with it. The unique skills and knowledge from these talented students can make a significant contribution to not only the growth and reputation of the employers, but also the overall economic and technological advance of the US society.

I hope more and more people would get to see the benefits of this policy and support it.
