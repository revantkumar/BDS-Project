I thank DHS for giving this an opportunity for all the STEM aspirants to stay in the US and contribute to the technical advancement of this country.

I really think that the STEM extension of 24 months is necessary for all of us. The academia experience of US eduaction system and the corresponding industrial experience is a boon to our knowledge and would also shape our career goals. 

I kindly request you to extend the STEM F1 stay in the US.
