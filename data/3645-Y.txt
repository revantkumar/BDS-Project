If we think from very beginning we will find its a good idea. Think about the international students. Usually those who study aboard have either money or ambition. In the first case, If they have money, then while impulsing our consumption, let them have the chance to work here can help them know more about our economy and our culture. They could come up with a chance to invest in America sometime in the future. Even if they come back to their country, with better understanding of American culture, they can adapt to the American products more easily and more quickly. it can help our companies to expand their global market in different countries. Iin the second case, if they are ambitious students and they have a goal to reach, things even become better. They are part of our work force and the best part is that we remain the chance to select who we need from them. We could just keep the best among them to continuously providing new workers to in certain industries. If they have a goal on their own country and once they achieve, such as becoming a respected scientists or industry specialists, they will be more easygoing with Americans as they know American ways better and this can avoid potential misunderstandings. All in all, it has long time benefit to the United States.
