I strongly support OPT extension for following points:
1. The US has advanced OPT program that allows foreign STEM students accumulate practical experience. I don't believe the US would be able to attract international students, if OPT program was cancelled.
2. To shorten or cancel OPT extension would do harm to US government's reputation which nobody expected. In reality, most foreign STEM students are now under promised 17 months OPT extension. There is no way to let them suspended by weakening OPT extension.
3. As National Science Foundation(NSF) reported, major projects are supposed to be completed by 3 to 4 years period. It looks kind of pale where OPT program is 12 + 24 months.
Overall, OPT extension shall be reinforced by any means to remain the US academic sector competitive globally.
