Fang Ho I agree with this proposal. I am a CS student from University of Michigan. When I look at the classmates' resume, hard working Americans always have a long list of internships and researches and decided their future early (either sign on an offer letter or apply for further education). But the companies still hiring a lot of foreign students even they need to pay punishment (e-verify program, mentoring and training plan will increase their cost) while offering the same or higher salary as American employees. So I believe companies can get enough benefit through OPT and STEM extension. And the country can get benefit as well, like more tax income, a better economic growth, and more growth point around those companies.
