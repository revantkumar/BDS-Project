I think OPT extension could help United State engage more talent which would bring greatest resource to help the economy to boom.

I am a software engineer in Facebook. Before I join Facebook, I got my master degree in University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I would say OPT extension is the biggest plus to make me choose to study in US. When I graduated from my university in China, I was hesitating whether I should continue my graduate study in US or Hong Kong. Hong Kong is pretty good. There are a lot of excellent professors in HKU and HKUST. But US is pretty attractive to me. Silicon Valley has a lot of fantastic IT company, such as Google, Facebook, Linkedin, and etc. Besides, OPT extension would allow me to work for at least 29 months. After my hard working, I got the offer from Facebook. In addition, most of my friends who study in US and got into Facebook have a similar experience as me. I would say, if OPT extension is abandoned, the IT big name would lose a lot of employees and engineers. The US government would lose their most important increase on their company.
