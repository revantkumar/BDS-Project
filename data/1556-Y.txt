I SUPPORT this proposal for the following reason:

1. Training Opportunity is an important part of a student's academic training. One year is not enough for a student to fully develop his or her capacity as a mature worker in the industry. There is no reason to deprive F-1 or similar status students of such a opportunity. They come to American with the hope of getting a high quality full education. Their right should not be limited without good reasons.

2. It is not an good idea for the government to decide how long a working contract between an employer and an employee should last. For the most part, it should depend on the employer's decision and the employee's choice. The government may put some limit to the opt time but merely one year does not leave much room for the employer and the employee. The interest of both sides may be hurt.

3. Nonimmigrant students are an important part of global communication. Allowing them to stay in US longer with a stable income certainly makes them feel more welcomed, which promotes mutual understanding and helps bridge cultural and nationalistic divisions.
