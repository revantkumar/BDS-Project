As an engineering degree graduate student, I am now working in a civil engineering company in Arkansas. Although we only have 4 people in our transportation group, two of us from China and one from India, and we have a lot of roadway design projects each year like trail design, roundabout design... We all worked very hard to catch up with the deadline, cannot imagine how the company continue working on transportation project without us. We design roads only to better serve the community, and I believe that many of Asian employees do the same thing. The extended 24 month OPT for STEM major student can only benefit the country in all aspects.
