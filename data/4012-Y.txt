I strongly support the proposal for the several reasons:

1. US is built up by highly advanced science and technology, STEM related major international student made huge contributions to these area, such as IT and silicon valley. OPT extension is very good to US economy.

2. US is successful by diversity.

3. US school made highly educated student, it should make them make contributions to this country.
