Douglas Orton This proposed rule is not in the best interests of American graduates with STEM degrees, or our country, and will put downward pressure on American's wages and dim their job prospects. Also if employers don't have to pay Social security and Medicare taxes on these employees, this becomes an even greater incentive not to hire American STEM graduates. Scrap this proposal completely and design something that is beneficial to American STEM graduates and the social security and medicare trust funds, instead of the large special interest corporations that employ STEM employees.
