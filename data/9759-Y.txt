I have seen some negative comments about OPT extension. However, OPT attracts smartest international students who are willing to study at a U.S. academic institution, that the U.S academic level will still be competitive and furthermore benefits American people. Nowadays top institutions like MIT or Stanford have lots of great faculties or students who was born in another country, and these guys makes great achievements for Unities States. So I support to pass the OPT extension.
