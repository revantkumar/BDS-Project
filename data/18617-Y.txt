I agree with the extension of OPT for F1 students majoring in STEM for three reasons:

1. The U.S. is faced up with stronger and stronger competitions from other countries like China, Russia, India and so on. China 
can develop so fast nowadays due to its adequate human resource, not only in manufacture but also in STEM related fields. 
People have realized the importance of STEM related jobs in the development of one country, especially for the U.S., and these
fields have a large demand for human resource nowadays. Therefore, we should extend the OPT for F1 students in order to 
maintain an enough pool of human resource, which can help the U.S. remain competitive in the future.

2. As I know, many students majoring in STEM fields are international students, coming from India, China and so on. Current 
12 months OPT period is too short for these students to even get familiar with what they need to do in their companies. 
Extending the OPT period to 24 months will help them and their employers get more familiar with each other.

3. As I know, most of the international students studying in the U.S. are very talented and creative people in their homeland,
like the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai. Their talents are treasury for the U.S. Their homeland spends about 20 years to 
educate them, but they can contribute for the U.S. immediately. What a bargain, right? And those international students 
who wish to develop their careers after graduation are willing to become a part of the country, most of which respect and 
value what Americans care, like freedom, justice, otherwise they will not choose to stay here.

To draw a conclusion, in order to assure the long-term competiveness of the U.S., we should attract more talented people 
around the world to work here. And the extension of OPT to 24 months is just a small step for this.
