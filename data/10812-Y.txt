I've posted to support OPT, but after I read through the reasons Americans list against the OPT, I have to request the law makers to ignore some ridiculous comments or at least check if it makes sense. First, you only think about the job Americans lose, but think about how many Americans take over the jobs in other countries. If you can't find one maybe you can try overseas as well. Or we'd better tell our own country sending back all the Americans because according to your excuse, the companies in our country should train our people first and don't hire those experts because they are American. Or we should drive away all American companies out of our country say Ford because they are taking away the market share of our brand. Second, if you have ever worked in a real global company not those small shops or still in school worrying about finding a job, you would notice, the portion of STEM students is so small that you won't notice their existence, but when you need a tech help, you would be upset since most of your American colleagues may not be of any help. Third, STEM students are not taking over all the jobs. Be wise to google and you will find only 34k are in the USA. They take some key tech positions so you American managers can run your operations smoothly and create more jobs for Americans. Fifth, STEM students pay much higher tuition to get trained in school, and why would it be more cost saving for companies to hire someone whose maths is below average because he or she spends most of the time in college drinking and blames the American companies not offering enough training? And by the way, OPT students are not immigrants.
