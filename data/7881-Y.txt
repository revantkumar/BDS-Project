Rj Sakai I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because: A competitive environment helps the society to move forward. If citizens in the US have difficulties competing with international students when they trying to find a job, that means they didn't really fight for it. Every one deserve a chance to pursuit what they want. International students don't expect complete equality, but we fight for our opportunities.
