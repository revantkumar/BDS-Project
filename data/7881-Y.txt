I totoal ageee to extend OPT. As an international students we study hard and work hard. We can bring so much value to the economy and society.However if stop the opt extension we can not work for the company. For example some of my classmates plays important tole in a project, if it stops, they will forced to go back home so that the project will be left to others. these people have to spend more time understand how to do it from the begining.Compamy will spend time and money training them. It cost too much to the company. Besides, many international studnents love to work as volumteer. If they go back home, many NGO will have trouble finding labor force. Many people in need will become helpless.
