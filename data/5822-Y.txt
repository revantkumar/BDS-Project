I strongly support this rule considering the following reasons.
1. America is a country which has the spirit of equal right no matter for the race, religion and gender. That is why it can attract talented people to serve this country.

2. It is very important for students to have a longer period of OPT since they can have more time to improve the skills after graduation.

3. If this rule is not allowed, it will result that many IT professionals have to leave the country. It will definetely influence the operation of IT companies like Google and Facebook.

4.This rule could help to increase the economy of America since talented people have more time to working in America.
