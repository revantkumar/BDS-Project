Elaine Gill I strongly support improving and expanding OPT to 24 months. 

Reasons are as follows:

(1) One year OPT is not enough. Lots of projects require more 3 or 4 years, only 1 year. I'm major in Computer Science. Tons of projects require a lot of effort and long time, as we need to first build simulation programs to confirm the idea of the project actually working, then we need collect data, usually the data is huge, and the data collection usually takes a long time (for example medical data). After that we need process data and analyze results. 

(2) International students bring profit to the local economics. For example, the restaurants, rental companies and so on and so for. 

(3) As the regulation requires e-Verify firms. E-Verify requires there is no discrimination during the hiring. "E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status", which is really nice
