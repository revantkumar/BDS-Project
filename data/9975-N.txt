there is no reason with our countries unemployment numbers to offer jobs to foreign workers when we have plenty of people here willing and able to work . the only reason I can think of is to drive wages down and giving money for companies to hire outside people isn't right. this needs to stop our young people how can do the jobs cant get the jobs or pay off their debts because of companies hiring migrants.
