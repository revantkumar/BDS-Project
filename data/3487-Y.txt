I definitely support this policy for improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. The reasons are listed as follows:

(i) International students that graduate with STEM degrees always totally contribute their abilities and knowledge in the position once they get the work chance. They try to finish each project well and gain the practical skills in this process. They are very hard-workers to do their best in the limited OPT period. Thus, they deserve to be given longer OPT period, which would definitely enhance their education from America and make the company gain more improvements and benefits from these hard-working international students;

(ii) In opposite, cancelling the expanding OPT for F-1 students with STEM degrees would negatively influence their job seeking process. For example, the mechanical engineer position always requires a new employee taking the training to familiar with the work flow before they really start it. Subsequently, if the OPT period is very short, the hiring manager will consider this point and may refuse the application from the international students;

(iii) The reason why US education could attract talented international students coming to study is not only for the education itself, but also the entire social environment in US. The practical experience during OPT period would be a factor to attract them. Hence, longer OPT will attract more talented students from worldwide.

In condition, I strongly support this rule.
