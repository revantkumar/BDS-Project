It is a good thing to help people from other nations be educated to help their own country when they return or even stay but not with an additional advantage to American workers. How about offering our own people a hand up in these troubling economic times too. When are we going to regroup our own economy? And why is Obama so set on showing young people how to refuse to honor the Constitution and play by his own set of rules instead of being a beacon of trust, honesty, and integrity. Terribly disappointed in this President on so many levels. And Obama is always slamming business for being driven by money decisions but here he is providing them a way to do just that. This is just one more way to disadvantage those of us who have paid our dues to Social Security, then witness our President and business chose to not follow their conscience and principles.
