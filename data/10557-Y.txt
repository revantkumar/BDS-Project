Zhe Xu I support the STEM OPT extension, the reasons are as below:

1 It enhances the current human resourcing process by making more qualified candidates to be available for recruitment, as these international students have passed the admission exam to a master or higher level program and many of them are from top schools with a high GPA. By extending the time period, more talents will be ensured to be flowed from school to the industry, which is beneficial for the society.

2 It provides more diversity to the employment market and will enhance the competition ability of the US market overall. As US is facing the competition around the world, international students could bring a broader range of point of views to the corporation and enhance the performance internationally.

3 It also provides an opportunity to the international students to improve the ability and learn how to utilize the knowledge learned from school to the practical business environment and makes them more professional quickly.

On the whole, it will bring energy to the US economy, which is needed the most at this point of time.
