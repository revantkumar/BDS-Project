I strongly support the extension program for STEM student.

As the most innovative country among the world, we shall not expel these most talented people from our country. Instead, we shall let them stay and make contribution to our country. The unemployment rate has been reduced to the lowest point among all years and that's why I don't think this extension program will affect our citizen's employment status. These people are mostly scientists and engineers. Don't forget who helped us to win the world war!
Therefore, the extension program is beneficial for our country!
