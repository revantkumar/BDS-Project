I strongly support this policy for the following reasons.

1. Its a fact that the number of American students in the STEM majors is decreasing, which is the reason for this policy, rather than the result of having this kind of rules. Therefore, this policy is so needed to allow talented international STEM students help to meet the gap between what the industrial need and what the colleges provide.

2. Giving the international STEM students more opportunities can benefit the economy of US, by keeping US competitive in those fields. More jobs can be created for everyone as a result, rather than being stolen away. Also, it is beneficial to the American education system, because it helps to bring the best students around the world to US. 

3. Most importantly, as an immigrant nation that is built upon the idea that all men are created equal, US should try to provide opportunities to the diligent international students to pursue their dream, for it is not just their dream but also the dream of US.
