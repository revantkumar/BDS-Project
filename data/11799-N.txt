Only .5% of American citizens have gotten work since the year 2000 out of 6%. The others were all immigrants. We have the lowest control of the border in 40 years. With TPP we outsource our jobs to multinational corporations who don't have to advertise to American workers. THE U.S. WORKER HAS HAD ENOUGH OF OBAMA'S FLOOD OF FOREIGN WORKERS. JUST SAY NO OR WE'LL ALL AVOID DEMOCRAT LEADERS, SINCE THEY DO THIS THE WORST, (SINCE DEMS VOTED FOR IT AFTER YOU VOTED AGAINST IT ON TPP TOO). THE AMERICAN WORKERS WAGES HAVE GONE DOWN SO BADLY THAT WE'RE AGAINST EVEN ANY REPUBLICANS WANTING MORE FOREIGN WORKERS OR AMNESTY LIKE THE PLAGUE!
