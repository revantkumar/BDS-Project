I strongly oppose this measure of extending OPT visas. This is an unfair policy that directly threatens regular hardworking American's STEM work opportunities. This also directly contradicts equality for other majors not included in STEM fields. For example, it would be unfair to accounting majors who don't get their OPT visas extended as well. Thanks for your consideration. In fact, OPT should just be limited to 12 months since if the international students are outstanding themselves they will stand out already. Extending OPT will only bring more problems such as depleting university resources and rare working opportunities for regular hardworking citizens.
