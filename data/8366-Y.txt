I strongly support the STEM OPT extension. STEM students are contributing to the country on the growing technical positions. More worker are needed at these positions while there are not enough US student pursuing advanced degree to fulfill these positions. I know there are government funded programs just trying to encourage STEM students taking advanced degrees. OPT extension is important to fill the gap while the H1b VISA is so limited.
