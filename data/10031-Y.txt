ashish chaudhary I support the 24 month extension. This new OPT STEM extension that has been proposed by DHS is very apt and is very favorable for the US economy and for the development of US as a whole to lead and compete with other emerging tech powers. By employing and extending the work for eligible and skilled workers of STEM they allow for the companies and businesses to grow. Also it helps people from STEM background to live in US culture which helps them develop themselves. At the end we all are striving to work for the development of the USA. So this extension is a very good gesture to allow the STEM people to work hard and help towards improving the position of US in STEM fields.
