Hao Xue As an international student, I strongly support the new OPT extension rule. First of all, I believe it is the power of immigration that makes United States the most powerful country in less than three hundred years. Talented person from STEM majors help the IT and financial industry earn billions of dollars annually and create enormous domestic consumptions in daily expenses (food, apartment, travel, etc), education, training, which aggregates the demand of the society and creates more job opportunities. According to NAFSA, 2013-2014, international students contribute more than $26.8 billion to American economy and create more than 340,000 jobs to American people. Moreover, since the OPT extension is only for the STEM majors, it would not harm the job opportunities for American citizens and residents. As I found online, without the STEM students who are on OPT, the demands in those areas far exceed the supply. Big technology companies would be the ones suffer the most if OPT extension could not pass since they would lose a great amount of good engineers who work hard every day to improve and facilitate people's life. In all, I really wish the OPT extension could pass since it would benefit not only the international F1 STEM students, but also the society, employers and all American people.
