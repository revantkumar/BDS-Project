I am in full support of the new revised rule for F1 Stem OPT extension.Below are my points

1) Students that are coming to united states to pursue the education generally belong in the top 10 % of their class.By attracting these highly talented people helps in many ways in innovation, new ideas and new perspective and USA also benefits from these students.
2) Every Student aspires for better life and better education, after spending nearly $40- 50 K to earn their degree ( nearly 1000% more that what it costs in their country) they should be given chance and time to practice what they have learnt in with mentoring so that they can survive in the tough world

And i have seen some comments mentioning about not contributing to social service and in taxes, to counter that they also pay high education fees compared to local students for whom fees are less
