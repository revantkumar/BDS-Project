Hehe Chen Students from all over the world come to United States to study knowledge. Meanwhile, these students contribute very much to this nation. For example, lots of F-1 students are teaching assistants that help the universities improve the education. Many of them would stay in America for a while working, which boosts America's economy. Moreover, F-1 students bring different cultures and even knowledge through out the world. I think most people would agree that these F-1 students make America better and have already played an important role in many aspects of this society.

This proposal, that improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students, is totally, utterly, absolutely significant and marvelous. It shows that America, this super country, has a big heart and wise brain. It benefits F-1 students with STEM degrees a lot as well. I am a F-1 student and I love this nation. I hope this proposal could go through!
