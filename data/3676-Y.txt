The US unemployment rate is much higher than the government reports. People have stopped looking for jobs because there aren't any! How can we consider more job opportunities for foreign students when there are so many US citizens who need jobs? We can't!!

How can we bring more foreigners, students, in when we do not vet them properly? We can't!

No to expansion.
