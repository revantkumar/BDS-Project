My name is Frank Macatee and I am a host parent for Yuqian Gao.She is a hard working gifted young lady who would be an asset to any company that hires her. She brings an international skill set to any program she works for, As I worked internationally for many years, I know the importance of bi-lingual skills and what it adds to ones ability. She has earned her Masters Degree at the University of Florida and continues to study learning more to improve her skills.
I think Yuqian is a good fit for this policy and an asset to our country.
