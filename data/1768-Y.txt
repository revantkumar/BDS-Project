Personally speaking, I strong SUPPORT the proposal for the following several reasons.
1.Since the U.S. economy largely depends on the development of technology, it is a wise idea to extend the OPT to 24 months. During the OPT time, international students, who have learned a great amount of knowledge from the U.S. university, can actively find an internship in large corporations, making great contribution to the U.S. economy. In contrast, for U.S. citizens, many students are unwilling to join in the STEM careers. If the OPT is only limited to 1 year, then international students may not be able to continue their job after the OPT, thus, resulting in serious human resources problem in big companies as well as in high-tech fields. 
2.The U.S. attracts the international students from all over the world not only for its high research level, but also for its diversity. When the OPT is extended, international students are able to work and study in the U.S. further, enriching the cultural diversity. 
3.Many great breakthroughs in STEM fields were made by scientists and engineers without U.S. nationality. The U.S. is tolerant to the variety in culture and nationality, thus it is why that America developed so quickly in the past several decades and became the strongest country around the world. Extending the OPT is definitely a way to further maintain this developing trend because this proposal can continuously attract more outstanding international students. 
In conclusion, this proposal is definitely a beneficial for the development of the U.S.!
