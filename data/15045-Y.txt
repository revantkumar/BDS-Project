I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also important for nation's economic, scientific growth. And by implementing the knowledge they learnt, will help the nation to grow.
