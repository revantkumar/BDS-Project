The proposed rule is beneficial to the growth of US economy, especially the high-tech industry. The high-tech industry is growing very rapidly, and it is in huge demand of qualified workers. However, the supply of qualified workforce is very limited. The proposed rule will give international students with STEM degrees more time to work and train in high-tech companies. Thus, they can help compensate the supply of qualified workers for high-tech industry, and they can provide more helps for the growth of US economy. 

Additionally, the US high education system shall be better used to serve the American interests, rather than other countries. The nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees received their education in US schools. It is better to allow more of them to work for American companies, thus contributing to the American interests with the education they received in US. This proposed rule extends the training period of nonimmigrant STEM students, and it can help achieve retaining more of the STEM students in US. 

Third, US is always an immigrant country. Not passing this proposed rule will be a great setback for the openness of American immigration policy. Not passing the proposal will set a negative image for future potential students to consider studying in US. Not passing the proposed bill will result in less international students to come to US for study, and it will result in less revenue for American universities, which eventually will lead to the degradation of American education system. 

In conclusion, the proposed bill benefits the US economy.
