Chrisa Ceh I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Diversity is highly valued in United States. International students have made great contribution to the economy, finance, technology, etc. This is what makes United States strong. If these students are forced to go back to their home country, I am afraid the United States is no longer the strongest country in the world.

2. Internationals students are not a threat to local American as we are not taking their jobs. We are doing high-end professions with our high-end skills. The more contribution we make, the more tax we pay, Americans will benefit more.
