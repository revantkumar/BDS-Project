I fully support the OPT extension rule. One of the reasons that the US can stand as the leading country in the world is that we can attract the most talented people from the whole world. I am very proud with our education system, which trains both domestic and foreign students to better contribute to the US and world. This is not only important for keep our country on the cutting edge of technology, but also continue our influence to other countries. It is important to understand that future US and world will be shaped by technology. Please encourage our kids to go to the technology field and keep these foreign talent for the US.
