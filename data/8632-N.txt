I am so totally against this rule because OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
As long as there are unemployed Americans {and we know there are many}I will not support any rule that takes jobs away from them.
