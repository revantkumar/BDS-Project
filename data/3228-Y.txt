First of all I would like to thank all the people who are involved in making this rule and bringing it to this stage. This is really a desired thing because if this rule is not published then there may be decrease in number of international students coming to US who want to pursue their studies and want to work hard for the development of the economy. This occurs a huge loss to the US economy furthur leads to decrease of intelligent people coming from different countries. There are many foreign students who are really genius and who can grow the US economy. I request you to encourage all the international students by giving 24 months STEM extension.

Thanks!
