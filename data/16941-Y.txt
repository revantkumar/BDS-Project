I am a graduating international student studying computer engineering at a top tier US school. Being a minority student, I enjoy the open discussions with American students at my school. We have worked together on interview preparations during job hunting and at the end we all received many competitive offers from different companies. I don't think the companies, like many rumors said, offer international students less than american students. On the contrary, they offer candidates compensations based on their experience and performance, and those compensations are becoming increasingly transparent. It is impractical that a company pays international students less. From my experience, American students benefit from having international peers in their schools. Upon graduation, they become more competitive on a global scale. Therefore, I am in support of this new STEM extension proposal. I don't think it's a wise decision for the country to reject this proposal.

Thank you.
