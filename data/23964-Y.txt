I support the extension for a few obvious reasons. The average tax paid by STEM visa workers is higher than national average and the benefit the work staff requires is much lower than average largely due to the fact that the new workers does not have as large a family to support as average American. So, the net transfer of wealth from STEM visa workers to the average American is strictly positive. Further, the law requires that STEM workers have to do jobs companies can not fulfill with local work force or require much higher cost otherwise. So, if by all means, the addition of STEM visa workers to the American work force is strictly positive. 
If one does not believe in the execution of enforcing that STEM jobs are fulfilled with qualified American, it is completely another issue than blocking the qualified STEM workers from working.
The constitute of this nation as I recall said that one, each of us, are entitled for the due share of right to pursue the inalienable right of happiness on this land. 
Holding one faith in the thoughts that used to make this country great and brought the world's talent together, we can create more job opportunities for future generations to come. Contrarily, we can sleep on the success today and block others from being successful in this country and force them to go back to their country and come back to compete with US companies by any means. 
If one just want to cash out the success today and forfeit the right of future generation to live in a successful story, I have no more comment. However, I doubt this is true.
