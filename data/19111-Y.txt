I strongly agree with Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. United State is well know for high technology, innovation and science. Expanding OPT period will help Student better find their fit in US and make contribution to the country. United state need to embrace more culture and way of thinking and it will lead to innovation in technology and science. It's a win-win deal.
