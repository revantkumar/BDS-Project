I support to extend opt. Because USA needs technical people. Every country needs! This part of people do something really help economy. If US government rules out those people, what else left? People who like to use stock to make money or farm. American needs to keep advanced. 
This part of people do not occupy the jobs for other untrained people. Besides that, people from other countries are more likely to obey the law and do job well.
