I adamantly oppose the new OPT rule.

This expanded OPT program is designed to hurt Americans:

*allows most participants to pay NO money into Social Security or Medicare; 

*takes hundreds of thousands of American jobs and hands them to foreigners;

*fails to require employers to pay the prevailing wage.

Under this program, over half a million ADDITIONAL foreign students would qualify for this scam program, bringing the total to 700,000 foreign workers taking American jobs. 

These foreign workers and their employers will NOT PAY any social security payroll taxes. 

This has already shortchanged the Social Security fund over 1 Billion dollars in 1 year. And if this new rule goes into effect, that shortage will be several Billions of dollars more. 

Supporters of the OPT program are the fine folks such as Disney, Toys R Us, SunTrust Bank, QUALCOMM and Microsoft. Interestingly enough, QUALCOMM just announced 4,500 American layoffs and Microsoft will layoff 7,500 in the coming year.

The OPT jobs giveaway program is so bad that even the pro-amnesty AFL-CIO has come out against it.

This is completely corrupt. And you are smart enough to know that the OPT program is corrupt.

Stop. It. Now.
