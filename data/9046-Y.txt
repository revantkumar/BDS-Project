Susan Ramsey I personally approve of improving and expanding the OPT program.
First of all, as far as I know, international students are making tremendous contributions to our country. Immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies employed around 4 million workers around the world in 2011 and were responsible for more than $1.7 trillion in revenues in 2010, according to the Partnership For A New American Economy (http://www.renewoureconomy.org/sites/all/themes/pnae/img/new-american-fortune-500-june-2011.pdf). Thus, it is improvident for us to opposed the OPT extension.

Secondly, I don not think international students with STEM "steal" our job opportunities. The number of students with STEM background can not meet the urgent need of our society right now. If people are not qualified but blame those F1 students for taking their jobs, I do not see any hope in this country. Even the F1 students all left after graduation, the companies would just hire them overseas instead of hiring locals who are not capable of doing the job. What's more, more competition can drive us to hone our skills and improve the innovation of our technology industry. It is a waste of time complaining about the OPT program when you are not good enough and qualified.
