I support this proposal. There are few American people majoring in the STEM degrees; and the majority is international students. Therefore international students are the core for the improvements in those fields. It is a great idea to make those high intelligent international students stay in the US and contribute their knowledge in those fields, to which American people are not willing to or not able to devote themselves. We should leverage this kind of resource.
