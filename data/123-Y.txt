I support the STEM OPT extension programme 
I finished my master program 1 year ago and now I am working in a pharmaceutical company. As most of the Biochemistry students,I have spend around 3 years in lab at university, working hard to pursue my master degree. After all that hard working, I got my first job. I am proud that I have been done a really good job here and my boss would like to have more of my friends at school coming around to our company. 
It is not true that we are taking the working opportunities away from residents, our company is recuriting people now. Its not like we are working here then the residents lost their job. We devote ourselves to make US better and we deserve a chance to have a longer time to improve ourselves after school!
