Ask anyone in industry, they will tell you that if they can hire a US citizen, whey wouldn't hire a OPT holder because of all the extra work and uncertainty. So the truth is that OPT holders just take the leftover of the high-tech jobs.

And don't think that US citizens can have more jobs if the OPT holders leave. Those jobs require a lot of training. However, US STEM education in kids is below average level (http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei/edTool/data/highschool-08.html). This means that, you, as taxpayers, have to pay more to train US students to work in those positions (not to mention that many foreign students pay their own tuition). The training also takes time, but the companies won't wait: if you get rid of OPT extension, the jobs will go to H1b visa holders. If you get rid of H1b as well, the jobs will go abroad, and you will pay extra to import the technolegy developed by the previous OPT holders, who could have done it in the US (and contribute a lot as taxpayers). 

The foreign STEM students come to US legally. And if they want to stay in the US, they will do so legally. They ensure US's leading position in science and technology. They make all the technology affordable to you. If you really care about the immigration system, think about the millions of illegal immigrants.
