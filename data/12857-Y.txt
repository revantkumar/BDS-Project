I have been in the IT sector for 24+ years. I know there are good qualified American citizens in IT because I work with them, and we are very busy to the point where we are turning away work. It seems like every time I negotiate a bid or contract for services, the client asks "Would I save money if I use off-shore personnel?" I tell them they will pay a lower per person per hour cost, but they will be paying for more personnel, and I will remove myself from being responsible for any deliverables. about half of the time things go OK, and the other half of the time the client calls asking for help, as things are critical/behind/low quality... etc.
