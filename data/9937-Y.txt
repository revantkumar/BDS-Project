THIS WOULD BE A GOOD BILL TO KEEP EDUCATED IMIGRATES IN THE STATES AFTER LIVING HERE AS STUDENTS AND ALSO AFTER GETTING DEGREES. WHY DO WE PUSH THE STUDENT TO RETURN TO OTHER COUNTRIES AFTER THEY HAVE SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR TO GET AND EDUCATION AND NOT BEING ABLE TO WORK. I WOULD THINK THEY HAVE EARNED A CHANGE TO SHOW THEY ARE ABLE TO ADD TO THE TO OUR ENOMONIC SYSTEMS AS WELL AS SOCIAL SYSTEM.
