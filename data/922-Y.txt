Many people are worried about the competition brought by international students. However, it is the competition that ensures US's top 1 position in the world (the world is evolving and full of competition no matter people like it or not ). It is the openness (including the friendly policy to international students and new immigrants) that distinguishes US from the European countries, which suffer greatly from their conservativeness to foreigners. While working, the international students also pay taxes and many of them pay SSN just as US citizens. They don't hurt the current tax and retirement system but instead contribute to it. No matter these international students (especially the STEM students) become new immigrants eventually or return to their own country, they will not become a burden to US but will contribute their expertise to make US better and stronger during their stay in US.
