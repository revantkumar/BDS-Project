The duration of an extension should be set at least 24 months, rather than limited to a shorter period, due to the complexity and typical durations of research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields. For example, I did a project which required a long time, but I had a limited OPT period. So the project was delayed.
