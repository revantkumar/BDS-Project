I do support this extension. As a foreign student, what I have learned and been most impressive about America is diversity and respect to diversity. That's one of the important aspects that accounts for America's primacy in the world. America gives talented and practical young men and women opportunities to pursue their dreams.
Since the inception of the first computer, the Internet technology, the chip companies, the booming Silicon Valley, we witnessed the success of so many foreign STEM students. America is attractive for more and more foreign students for further study and an OPT extension provides them opportunities to better apply their knowledge to the development of the American people's life. 
The American government spend a lot of money on Education. This assures the teaching quality in higher education and the diversity of the students which would in turn get higher creativity. The best return of the large amount of Eduction fund is to provide enough practical training time for these students to make their own contribution to science, art and technology to pay back the American society. 
Those who have several years of international working experience could enhance the business tie with USA and their mother country when they come back home.
