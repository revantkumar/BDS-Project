This is discrimination! I see it for what it is and plan to publicize my observation. You are discriminating against Americans
for their nation origin by giving foreigners the advantage for a job. Politicians seem to think they are so smart and that no one 
ever sees through the lies. You see citizens as subordinates whose only purpose is to support your financial follies, using tax dollars 
from Americans to provide for corporate and foreign welfare. Every American who is superseded for a job by a foreign worker 
should sue the company they applied to for discrimination, I know I would. I'll be posting this opinion and you know how fast
word travels these days, almost at the speed of stupid ideas like this.
