The new STEM extension would benefit many US tech firms tremendously since it would allow many foreign talents to work for these firms for an extended period of time. It would help the US economy greatly in the tech sector.

Note that STEM extension is not an immigration law given that F1 students are not dual-intent visa holders, it merely provides these foreign students an extended chance to develop some industry-related experience after they have completed their study in the US.
