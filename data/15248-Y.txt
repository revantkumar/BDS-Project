As an International student, I have to speak out what in my heart. I am in Computer Science major. I know that America has the most advanced IT techs because there are so many talented people from different countries devoting their specialty to this area. Expanding training opportunities will greatly help US keep the pace. Also the economy will be further improved because there will be more famous companies like facebook, google, etc. So i strongly support the improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students.
