Currently I am a international graduate student. After graduation, I want to stay in the US to make an impact with my skills. However, not all the companies sponsor H1B working visa. Thus, an alternative way is to use OPT to work in the US, which is the only way for the international students to work in the US without H1B visa.

With increasingly huge number of H1B applications, the chance to get the working visa is pretty low. If we can have longer OPT extension, things will be different. We can work for a US company for three years without H1B. For us students it will be a invaluable experience. Also for US companies it is a treasure. The brilliant minds from all over the world hope to work for the US. The progress of many industries in the US cannot happen without the international students. FACEBOOK may not appear since one of the cofounders had difficulty in getting the working visa. You could imagine how many great company would not appear if there was no international students. The US is an open country and welcome to everyone, which is the reason I come here to further my study. Now I want to make my contribution with what I learn in the US.

Please give me the opportunity and approve the OPT extension. Thank you.
