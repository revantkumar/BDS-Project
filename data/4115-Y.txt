I support the OPT exttension, because my parents invested a lot of money on me to study in USA, I wish I could at least get hired after graduate and have some woring experience in U.S. at least. I wish I could pay them back someday . I mean we paid much higher tuition here and get trained to have American dreams , why can't we stay for a while and getting some working experience.
