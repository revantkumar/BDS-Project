I'm a Chinese student. I was planning to go to Hong Kong for my master or Phd study before. But then a professor told me that if you really want to have the best education in the world, you need to go to America. Yes, in America, there are so many top universities. What's more, we international students can have opt after graduation to learn more things from the fast-developed industry before we come back to our hometown. There's no such thing in England or other places. That's really amazing. But if there will be only 12 month for OPT, it's too short for us to learn things. We will be less competitive when we come back since there are more and more students come back from aboard.

So rule really make the education in America more attractive to our international students, which I believe is a good thing for the whole country.
