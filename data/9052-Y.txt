I strongly support this proposal. As we all know, talents is the most valuable assets for high-tech companies. Retaining the graduates already studying in US is way better than hiring them from abroad. I think the government should think about the long term benefit of this rule. These graduates went to companies which are actually creating new businesses and introducing more job opportunities.
