I'm F1 Visa student and just applied OPT this week, and I'm about to graduate at December. So hopefully get my OPT as soon as possible to have chance to find a job. And please make OPT last to one year, 90 days is really hard to find a job and learn something kind too short. It also the last chance to stay in the US before we back to our country. So please!
