The OPT extension program is absolutely doing so much good for United States. It's funny to find out that some citizens thought international students stole their jobs. Don't take it for granted that unemployed citizens can get a job without international students, the truth is they can't meet the requirements of those companies. Americans you gotta to compete! On the contrary, with international students and OPT extension, companies can own more talented people and provide cheaper and better service to the whole nation. Again, Americans you got to compete instead of whining and crying.
