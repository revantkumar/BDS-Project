I don't get why people think OPT extension policy will make Americans lose jobs:

1. This is just a working authorization, not a green card. Foreign students still need sponsorship to keep working in the US, which is the biggest concern for many employers. Americans still get privileges in the job market. OPT extension do no harm to American job seekers

2. There aren't many Americans in the STEM area. I am a Chemistry PhD and I know the ratio of Americans in the STEM major. Highly educated foreign students can make up the gap of insufficient STEM workers and contribute to the US economy, which will be beneficial to all the Americans too.

3. US always wants to attract talented people, which is also one aspect that US standouts many other countries in the world. Talented people is the key to the development of economy and society, but it's not easy and cheap to get them from abroad. A good work authorization policy can keep those talented foreign students staying in the US. 

Thus, I support the OPT extension policy!
