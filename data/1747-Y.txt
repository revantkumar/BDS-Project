I knew that someone wants to drive international workers away because of jealousy. Because they are not competitive enough against international students who work 3 times harder than them. However, if they were driven away, are these native guys able to take the positions? Industry and institutions don't want people who likes to watch movies all the time, they want people who are knowledged and willing to work very hard.
