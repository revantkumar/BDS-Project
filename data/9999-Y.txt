Xunfei Sun I strongly support this rule. And I would like to refute two arguments.

1. F1-Stem students are very well paid. Me and my friends are all paid more then 60k per year. 

2. Employers won't save money on hiring us. They need to cover application fees and attorney fees for the H1-B application.
