While some people arguing that extending OPT will put more Americans out of work, the simple truth is that you cannot ask a farmer to do the job of a painter, and you cannot ask a painter to do the job of an engineer. To be honest, highly educated people with good personality will never have trouble finding a job, regardless of being an American or a foreign student. Those who has trouble finding a job is people who have limited skills or bad personalities.
The way to put more Americans at work is to EDUCATE them, not by limiting those who are ALREADY educated.
If I am the company manager, if I cannot find the workers with the required skills because you SENT them home, I will likely to move my company to their home country rather than hiring someone here who is incapable, sounds like creating more opportunities for other Americans? what a joke!
