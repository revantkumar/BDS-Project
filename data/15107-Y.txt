Yunxiang Fei To be honest, I don't want to say some big words. It's better to show you some data, after all, we are engineering students and we prove things with data. 

I'm a Chinese student who studying EE in UK, in my class, there are 32 Chinese students and 110 UK or EU students. The thing is more than 20 students are thinking about go to US to continue their postgraduate study and most significant reason is OPT which means they can stay and work for 29 months. And that is the most significant advantage of US compare with UK.

However, IF OPT is reduced or canceled, I have to say that the US university's attraction is significantly reduced too. After all,many of my friends and I have already got the offer from University of Collage London or Imperial College London in UK, It would be stupid that still go to US to study if OPT, the most attractive thing, is reduced. Currently, more than 30,000 students studying in UK and in fact, more and more students want to go US to continue their study because UK's bad immgration policy. But if US want to follow the example of UK, I have to say that US will lost many valuable people and investment, and finally to the same end like UK.

So, just image that, every year, more than 100,000 Chinese students go to US to study, and if OPT is reduced or suspended, may be there are only 20% people left who still want to go US to study, That's is a real disaster for US, not just for university which they will not get enough money but also those companies which they will not get enough high-tech people. 

So, THINK ABOUT IT, DO WE WANT WIN-WIN OR LOSE-LOSE SITUATION ???
