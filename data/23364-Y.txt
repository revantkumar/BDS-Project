I strongly support the expanding training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degree for the following reasons:
First of all, American spirit advocate equity. 
Fair competition is the critical driver of performance and innovation. It's like a catfish effect. The catfish effect is the effect that a strong competitor has in causing the weak to better themselves. This is an effective way to motivate a team or a country so that each member feels strong competition, thus keeping up the beneficial competitiveness of the whole country. 

Additionally, since, technology, engineering and math carers that are currently high demand in US. The IT industry is widely regarded as the primary driver of modern economic growth and the catalyst for that growth is the accessibility and mobility of computing power. Most of the STEM students will have chance to provide their excellent professional skills in IT industry and engineering industry. Some people in the previous comment mentioned that high paid opportunity should be given to American. However, in my opinion, high paid job or good opportunity should be give to talented people no matter where they come from. Therefore, anyone who have good skills or talented enough will not affect by any competition. This is also a good way to pick high-tech talents. 

At last, good opportunity for skill practicing and training is an essential reason for most of international students to consider come to US for further study. In this way, American universities will have more chance to admit more excellent students from all over the world. It's not only good for the U.S. education but also good for the U.S. Economy.
