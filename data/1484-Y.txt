I would like to favor the Extension period granted to students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (OPT STEM) and have it extended from 17 months to 24 months - 

It gives opportunities to all those international students to work in the field of their study and be a part of the on-going development in the field of Science and Technology. The majority of students pursuing Masters or PHDs consists of international students who work hard and contribute towards the economic growth of this nation - by participating in programs offered by universities and later on, working in companies or research institutes. A lot of start-ups are founded by international students which are helping in creating new jobs for everyone.
Not to forget, all those students, including myself, also pay taxes and maintain their legal status. 

I would also like to point out that F-1 students are not cheap labour, which is claimed by a lot of people who are not able to get jobs in big companies. In fact, students on OPT get competitive salaries based on their knowledge, experience and skill sets. In addition to this, they have to go through a series of difficult interview rounds in order to get a job. 

Moreover, international students would want to work for at least 3-4 years to pay off their student loans which requires them to apply for work visa H1B. And, with the increase in number of applicants per year, they need more time to maintain their legal status in the United States and be able to apply for the next round of H1B process.

In the end, I would like to say that the United States is still the Land of Opportunities and cutting STEM Extension program will cut those opportunities for international students.
