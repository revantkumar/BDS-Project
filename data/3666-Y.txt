I strongly support the act of expanding the STEM OPT training. 

For so many years, Imigrations and foreign students have been making huge contributions, boosting the economic growth in USA and indirectly created a lot of jobs. It's impossible for a country to provide a lot of position oppurtunities to its citizens if it's under economic depression. Only a strong economy can do that.
STEM is a critical field for the US to maintain its technological and economical leadership in the world. Rejecting international students, in the long run, will detriment the benefits of all American citizens.

Diversity is very important for the US. It's what makes the US different from any other country in the world. The US made the rest of the world proud because of its freedom, its diversity, and its attitude toward Imigrations and refugees.

I'm sure American people are wise enough to make the right decision. Irrational behavior dominated by anger, fear, misunderstanding or illusive satisfactory can never benefit this country.
