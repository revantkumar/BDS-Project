Feli Hudson International Stem students are the cream of the candidates standing in that long queue for legal immigration. Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. International students contributed almost US$27 billion to the US economy in 2014, which corresponds to a 12% increase versus 2013 when the total was US$24 billion. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. Even with more than 13 million Americans unemployed, the manufacturing sector cannot find people with the skills to take nearly 600,000 unfilled jobs, according to a study last fall by the Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A.
