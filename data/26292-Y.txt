Below comment is for Docket number: ICEB-2015-0002,for Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students:

24 months STEM extension is a very good thought by DHS. This helps graduate students to use their valuable technical skills in the development of companies which in-turn is a development for the country. This new rule will also help Employers to retain the skill that is gained by employees in the 1st 17 months for an extended period of time instead of investing in hiring a new employee after 17 months and spending money to get the employee up to speed. 
Other Advantage is that, H1b quota which is being over filled with numerous applications every year will be reduced to a considerable limit as companies will be applying for H1b visa for OPT students only towards the end of 24 month OPT period in order to retain the employee. I don't see any disadvantage in providing 24 months STEM extension for OPT students. I support this decision as it is beneficial for the country as well as International students.
