I am a PhD student studying mechanical engineering at UT-Austin and I am about to finish my study next year. I had the opportunity to work at Apple this past summer as a mechanical intern. It was an amazing experience to apply what I have learned in my graduate study to practical use. The platform of Apple or other companies like Google, Facebook is enabling numerous engineers to use their talent on a global scale, which has unprecedented impact on people in almost every country. Yet I saw a lot of brilliant young engineers from all over the world working at Apple are faced with the possibilities of having to leave the US because of their limited OPT time. It is becoming more and more difficult for international students to get the H1B visa so the OPT extension for STEM students would definitely make a huge difference not only for their life but also in making the US as well as the entire world a better place to live in.

Thank you for taking the time to read my comment!
