Tianshu Ji The STEM extension is definitely a good proposal. A lot of US companies need to train international students as their global leader to lead the over-sea team. Therefore, the three year OPT extension offers a great chance for companies to train their international team leader. At the same time, the training for STEM field is usually long, like rotations are usually three years and post doc training is usually 2 years. 

Meanwhile, the OPT extension can attract high level international talents to work in US. Also, because of the OPT policy and US work environment, the universities and colleges in US can also attract more international students, which will benefit universities both economically and academically.

Electrical, computer, chemical, mechanical engineerings are all fast growing fields in US and benefit US economy in long term. Let these international students stay can be beneficial in long term too.
