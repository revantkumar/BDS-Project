I strongly support the Stem opt extension! Previous comments said STEM industry in the US is already full. But really? Please go to any job search website, you can have an idea that how many high tech companies around the US are actively hiring STEM workers right now. Some people may argue that "US stem workers can fulfill the needs". But really? Companies need to pay extra money every year and go through extra processes to sponsor international STEM workers. If there are enough US stem workers, why will the companies bother to waste their money and time to hire international STEM workers? Therefore, having STEM opt extension can help to fulfill the need of STEM industry in the US, which I believe is an huge part of US economy.
