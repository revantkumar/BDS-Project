I object to providing such benefits to foreign students at the expense of American students who are equally qualified; We must first choose our own students, whose parents have paid for their education and training. I am a WW2 veteran who paid for my own children's education and expenses for their college expenses. Our own children should come first. Robert Rung, Saratoga, CA.
