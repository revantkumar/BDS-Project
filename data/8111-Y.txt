I support this new regulation.

As an international student, the main reason I come to US is the education. And OPT is a very important part of it because we can have more practical training experience. This regulation will attract more foreign students like me to come to US instead of other countries for further study.

Secondly, international students will also be able to contribute during the OPT. They participate in a lot of hi-tech projects, which will benefit US people, and make profits for local companies. Longer OPT will enable them to contribute more to the projects. Without OPT, a lot of projects in technology companies like Google, Facebook, Apple will be seriously affected.

Thirdly, international students will be able to help US economic growth. They can also support universities and other educational facilities to develop better.

So I think the new OPT regulation will be beneficial to both US people and international students.
