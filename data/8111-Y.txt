Yefei Di I am an international student with STEM degree. In my opinion, this extension is very important and meaningful for us. 
Science, technology, engineering and math have a common characteristic, which is application. That is to say, internship experience is a necessary part of these majors. Even though we have done lots of experiments or case studies in school, it's still totally different from real world work. Because reality is always complicated, the practical knowledge only can come from workplace. For example, I major in operations research and supply chain, and I have a course project which requires us work with a plant. During this project, I find that I get a better understanding about these lean operations methods. Because this plant uses these methods in the daily work and we can conduct the whole process personally. This experience let me know that only in-field work can build a bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge.
Moreover, the STEM extension can reduce pressure on H-1B sponsorship and protect the benefits of employers. According to what I know, many international students don't have certain mind about working in America or working in their own countries in the long run. Therefore, if we can have longer OPT period, we can find whether this environment is right for ourselves or not, and we can make a final decision for the long-term career path. Probably, most international students will not apply for H-1B visa, and the remaining students who apply for H-1B all have certain confidence to work in America and will not quit in the half way.
So I completely support the STEM OPT policy and hope it will come true in the near future.
