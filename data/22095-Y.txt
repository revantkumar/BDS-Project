Are those negative comments really thinking deep into this? Or just intuitively leave the comments without even thinking about it? The foreign employees with proficient skills are never paid less to work more. They are only paid fairly to work on their best, which facilitates the whole industry to progress. Neither have they ever stolen any working opportunities from local students. I mean the whole industry is in such a fast developing speed, can you really imagine losing so many proficient foreigners to contribute together with you? That would be a disaster to the whole industry.
