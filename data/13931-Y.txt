Last year I met a Chinese undergrad exchange student studying statistics. I could not be more excited, coz we enjoyed many similarities. I was looking forward to her coming in 2016. Recently she told me that OPT policy might have a negative effect in her career and she was considering not to apply for grad school here. I REALLY hope to welcome her next year! This is not because of our friendship, but of her dedication and hard work. This will benefit our economics, too! Please SAY YES to OPT extention!
