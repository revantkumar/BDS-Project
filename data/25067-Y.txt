The act is significant for the US in a way since the US is gonna lose about 100 thousand top talents from other countries, which will definately lead to great ecnomic losses. It is no wrong for some natives to oppose this act for more job opportunities, but I wonder if it is really good for the country's future development to do so? Maybe the arbiter should figure out a solution to fill in gaps before denying the proposal.
