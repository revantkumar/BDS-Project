I strongly support the extension for some reasons. Firstly, it is good for US that many talented people can work for US, create values for US, push technology development in US and pay tax to US as well; secondly, It benefits tech companies in STEM area because graduated students might be learning and in practice in the first year employment but after that they will start creating more and more values for companies even the entire industry.
