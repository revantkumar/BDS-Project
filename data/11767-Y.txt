I totally think this is a right thing to do, it's just what this country all about. In my opinion this group of well educated and talented international students will definitely help this country in a lot of ways. As I said before, it is the people around the world formed this country this way. They can be scientists or engineers, surely what this country needs. Sure, they might lower the chance of finding a job for American citizens, but bringing in the competition is also a motivation for all people to enhance their skill to be better, more creative more productive. It's definitely better than having a whole bunch of not so skilled and productive workers working under a not competitive environment.
