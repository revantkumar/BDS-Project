Let's talk about free will and reality.

Regardless of nationality, an individual should have his or her own will to study, work, live at a place that he or she wants to. By extending the OPT, international university students would have more chances to fulfill this purpose. Extending the OPT is doing the god's work.

Reality. If a local and an international university students given the same degree, GPA, etc applying for the same job, the local student will get the job 9 out of 10 times. It is the reality. There is no such thing that international graduates are stealing jobs from USA citizens.

According to above, I here vote for the extension of OPT.
