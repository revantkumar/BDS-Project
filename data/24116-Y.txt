I strongly support this new ruling. The OPT is important for international students who want to gain work experience in US and thus becomes one factor they can consider when they choose educational institutions for oversea studies. If this policy is canceled, there will be a huge impact on the educational market. International students have historically made significant contributions to the U.S economy, through the payment of tuition and living expenses for self and family. Additionally, foreign STEM students contribute more specifically to a number of advanced and innovative fields that are critical to national prosperity and security by conducting scientific research, developing new technologies, advancing existing technologies and creating new products and industries.
