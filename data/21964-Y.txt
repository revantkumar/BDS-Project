I strongly support the OPT extension plan. 

This plan gives international students more industry experience after their graduation in the most industrialized country. 

This plan makes the education program in US more attractive, which is helpful to US economy.

Most importantly, this plan helps high tech companies could find good candidates in short term when they couldn't find the right candidate among US citizens. 

Seems it is a win-win plan for both US and international students, I couldn't see any reason to object it.
