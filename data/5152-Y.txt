Alex Wang (2nd Comment) I hope DHS will approve this rule at the earliest.

1. It would be an exaggeration to say that foreign-born STEM students are taking away all the jobs for US-born STEM students. Actually in the circle of my classmates, I never see an American classmate who is able to graduate from our Engineering School cannot find a decent job. Americans should have known about it. Many STEM areas & jobs are only for US persons. Because of status and security clearance, foreign students can hardly get a job in these areas. US-born Mechanical/Chemical Engineering undergraduates from Engineering schools can easily get multiples job offers from big companies such as Raytheon, Boeing, GE, DuPont, DOW Chemical, blah, blah. Under Technical Alert List(Sensitive Major List), US-born STEM students have unique advantage.

2. Well, the employers still have to pay social security and medicare(7.65% is alluding to this I suppose) to the employee, so they don't save a penny there. Yes, OPT students don't have to pay them and that results in a loss of $4 billion. However, they are not eligible for social security benefits either. On the other hand, international students contribute about $26 billion in tuition fees alone. This is not an insignificant amount especially to universities. 

3. I think Americans have found that some kind of companies, especially ones from some country, is the reason why today happened. Also, there is rampant cheating among these companies. Many applicants file petitions with multiple "companies" in the same year to boost their chance, significantly lowering the chance of others who follow the rules. Foreign-born STEM students are suffering a great deal from it as well. I hope DHS will take more action.

4. Foreign STEM students are not illegal immigrants crossing the border. They are not gaming and abusing US immigration rules. They are always contributing a lot to the US and are the most innocent. Definitely, US needs a reform on immigration rules and more constructive suggestions to do it. It's too bad to see "If you play by the rules, you are the first to lose."
