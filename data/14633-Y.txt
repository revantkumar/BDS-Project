YES! I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension. 

First of all, international students make great contribution to the growth of economy of United States. Many high tech companies need great amount of talented engineers from STEM area and number of native STEM engineers are far from enough. 

Secondly, I think one reason why United States has advantages over Europe in high tech area is that immigrants are welcomed in United States. Most of international students are the top students in their mother country and they are excellent in creating profit for high tech companies. 

As far as I am concerned, international students has become an essential part of high tech companies and we shouldn't risk losing these talent people. Thus, I strongly support the OPT-extension.
