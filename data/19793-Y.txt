I support the extension, for it will not only generate more benefits for the U.S., but also attract most talented people in the world to contribute to the states.

The diversity will increase, and actually the cost of working will decrease. Losing the talented people in STEM will be a disaster for the country. 

If the extension is banned, then no one will pursue studying sciense & engineering and U.S. will lose its advantages in high technology, which constitutes the most of the GDP.
