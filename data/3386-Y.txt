I support this opt extension. As U.S has best universities in the world and educated best engineers. We should keep them not let them go. The H1 visa right not is a lottery. For foreigner students that is totally try their luck not competition. These extension is letting market work, the employers make their choice who is right person for their offering position.
For example, Texas has best high schools among states but lots of Texan universities lost best students. Each year, Texas exports a total of 19,389 high school graduates to four-year universities in other states. Keep the best students in state is goal for many years although not work. U.S. is a friendly immigration country in the history. Right now U.S. attract world wide genius. In case,U.S. lost this first place and try to competition with other world lead a big problem.
