First of all, I support this proposal with my feet down. This is a win-win propose to both American and F-1 nonimmigrant student. The immigration history of American can date back into 1960s. For nearly half country, talent immigrations from all over the world brings advanced academic knowledge, optimistic attitudes and passionate creativity to America. These people became part of elites in all kinds of area and make America grown into the most developed country in the world. That's the reason thousands of people praise highly of American education and good study atmosphere. I'm one of the people among them. That's also the reason why I choose America to continue and improve my academic career. Everyone will experience the process of seeking jobs. It is not easy and it spends nearly two month or more for seeking a position that suits you and they want you at the same time. It will spend a much longer time to make you familiar with the job and work with coworkers. From my perspective, the government should offer more opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students. 
It is not fair for spending half of the family saving to study in America but only 12 month for seeking job. These passionate young graduate need some time from university into the real world and contribute to society. There are a lot of twists and turns on the way of chasing dream and developing career. But if the government make a small step to improve it, that would be a giant leap for these young ambitious talent people skilling the world and make America a much prospective society.
