If the OPT program is limited to one year of work without extension, chances are that thousands of competitive international students might be forced to leave United States just because they're not lucky enough to get the visa. Companies will also be more reluctant to offer international students jobs because their investment to help international students get a H1-B visa will be in vain if their candidates can't get the visa and leave the US. But with the proposed STEM extension, students with STEM majors will have three years in total to explore their career and have larger chance to work for the US. I am part of the STEM major community, and thus I support the new STEM OPT extension proposal.
