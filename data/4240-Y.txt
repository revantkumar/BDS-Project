I really appreciate DHS for proposing rules for extending Opt extension . It will help to attract more talented student for US education. This will add more money to US economy. Also, it will help US economy to retain brilliant employee in US which will help in innovation industry to discover new technology. New technology will bring more money to US economy. 
Competition gives talent to industries. Opt extension of 24 months will help to retain Foreign student for longer duration to learn and show their talent in the US industries. 
We know US is a land of immigrants.these immigrants made US economy more stronger and powerful in the world. So, I totally support DHS new proposed rule.
