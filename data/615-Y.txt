YES, OPT-extension would be in the best interest of our nation.
I don't think it's harm to US citizens. Those who are intereste in science & technology and have strong ability should be hired by high tech companies. It just has nothing to do with citizenship! As far as I know many native citizen just have no interest in sitting before the screen coding and debugging. So how do we expect those IT companies to keep thriving without attracting talent workers from all over the world?
