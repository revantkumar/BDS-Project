Kevin Wen Above all, totally thumb up for the new extension.

I understand many US students' concerns. Nobody will doubt the highly competitive employment environment in the US. But that is also one of the key reasons why united states is still ahead of the rest of the world.

I guess the bottom line here is, I do not think many industries will remain as active and booming as it is now after many excellent international students' departure. Once the positive dynamics is broken, the situation will more likely to be that the overall scale and need of the employment market will also shrink in folds as more and more international students are NOT allowed to work anymore and the business of a great number of companies being effected. Do you think US students will then have more opportunities? I highly doubt it.

At the end of the day, international students are still in a much much tougher situation than US citizens in terms of getting employed. If you can not find a job even with that, please make yourself better in the first place and then complain. Outstanding students will always get a job, one way or another, despite how competitive the market is.
