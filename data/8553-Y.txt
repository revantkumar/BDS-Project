Allowing talented foreigners working in US makes this country the best one in the world. IT industry is currently a main stream for US economy, the number of US software engineers cannot satisfy the needs from all US firms. If all talented foreign students cannot work for companies for short time, a lot of IT companies are going to close, which will severely impact economy and the life standards for citizens. What makes it even worse, once all talented people go back to their home countries, those countries are very likely to develop even faster and bypass US easily.
