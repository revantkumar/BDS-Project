I disagree, vehemently, to the extension of OPT from 12 months to 36 months. My reason is because too many jobs have been taken by legal immigrants from American tech workers. I've seen young people graduate 1st in class from F.I.T. not be able to find work. I've seen more and more legal immigrants taking coding and other IT jobs from American workers in large American corporations. I've also seen legal immigrants take jobs from Americans in engineering positions. 

While helping other countries is the correct thing to do, it shouldn't be done at the expense of our own countrymen and women. 

Why we even have to debate this issue is ridiculous. All it proves to me is that my government is not on the American people's side.
