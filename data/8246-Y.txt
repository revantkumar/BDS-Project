Arivuchelvan Pandian I strongly support this rule. The F-1 students are here by paying huge tution fee to the institutions. They are here because they want to study in reputed university to take their education to the next level and also to get practical training in their field of study. With having quota system for H1B they have limited option to apply the knowledge they gained in the US universities. It is unfair to just get their tution fees and not allowing them to gain exposure and experience. USCIS should implement this rule.
