I abdolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. Most international students work in scientific and technology, and many of them are among the best in their fields. STEM are fields critical for the US to continue its leadership in the world. Each year, h1b holders pay more than 27%, and often more than 30% of their salary to the federal, and even more to the federal and the state. This money is used in increasing the medical and other welfare of American people. It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens.
