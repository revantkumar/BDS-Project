US is a country built by hard-working and intelligent immigrants. Some local people who do not have enough skills and knowledge blame international students for taking their jobs. This reminds me of the Nazi, who blame that Jews took the Germans' money. 

Even if the international students leave US after graduation, the companies would still hire them overseas to keep the competitiveness instead of hiring locals who are not capable.
