We need to stop this bill from allowing foreign workers to take the jobs away from the American people. Right now there are people in the country without jobs that can't get them because of foreign and illegals taking all of the jobs. 
People come into this country from South America, Cuba, Mexico, Haiti, Bahamas, and several other places and take the jobs from the American people. We need to stop these workers from replacing all of us.
