I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. This change is imperative to United States' economic, scientific and technological competitiveness. It will lead to newer jobs and also lead to the country stopping the entire out sourcing of technology knowledge requirements.
