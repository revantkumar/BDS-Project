I support expanding the OPT program for students with a STEM degree. America invested in these brilliant young people and America should let these america-educated students use their expertise to help American businesses and American future. In the recent years, most of new technologies were invented by new immigrants and America needs more talented scientists, engineers and other researchers who can keep innovating. Innovation ensures the future of America, and the best way of having it is having america educated students with STEM degrees. My own story can be an example: I had my PhD degree in Physics in 2011 from University of California , and I used my 12 month plus 17 months STEM extension for researching in my company which is American company. Recently, I had several patents filed recently for the company from my recent years of research, and they are all american intelligent properties. All of these come from these extended 17 months of STEM OPT. If we can have longer STEM OPT extension, it would help more for fighting against the limit of H1B lottery, and would allow more time for research without worrying about the visa and other document.
