I strongly support this action. I think the extension of the STEM-extension period to 24 months is very reasonable for the students that obtained a STEM major degree from the U.S. The lack of H1B made many of the students that have studied in the U.S. had to go back to their own country immediately instead of using their knowledge to benefit the U.S. society. The current 17-month extension will only allow the students have one more chance to get H1B compared to the other majored students. This 24-month extensions will make more opportunities for the STEM majored students (three chances) to win H1B in the lottery. This can make sure their further contribution to the US society. I believe that will benefit the country more economically.
