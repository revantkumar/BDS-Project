Meet Shah According to me OPT extension should undoubtedly be extended to 24 months if not more than that. If you put yourself in their shoes and experience the difficulties and challenges all the bright international students have to go through to excel in their career, I think giving them a chance of 24 month of OPT extension is the least government could do. It will only encourage more bright International students to choose US universities for Higher education and be the major growth engine in development of US and of the world as a whole. It's like providing your best soldiers with best ammunition.
