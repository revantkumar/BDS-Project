We are a great nation because we attract the best talents from all over the world. We should not close our door. In the short run, business might be forced to hire more Americans, which might be good for unemployment rate but will be bad for the over all economy due to businesses not being able to get workers with the skills that they need the most. In the long run, the cons will definitely outweigh the pros. Other countries in the world are catching up. If we want our business to be competitive and if we want America to stay as the leader of the world, we should not give up our advantage to attract, select, and keep the best workers in the world. There is a reason why those STEM majors were selected. Companies have the need that are not fully met by American students.

I cannot be happier to see more Americans being hired, but the solution is not in here but in education. We should focus our efforts on improving high school and middle school education in maths, physics and related courses, and encourage American students to select the (usually harder and less fun) STEM majors. We win a game by becoming stronger ourselves, not by excluding opponents... 

There are a lot of voices against illegal immigrants lately. I am personally not a supporter of illegal immigrants but i want to say that there are different types of immigrants. Many immigrants come to the country legally and make great contributions to the society. I am not saying that illegal immigrants do not contribute to the country. But I think our country should have control over who can come to this country. If they are good people and what we need, we should open the legal way for them to join us and contribute to our great nation.
