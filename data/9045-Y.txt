I strongly support the opt-extension.

Some people object this rule because they think that the foreign students take away jobs from US-citizens. From my experience that is not what gonna happen. When I did my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State University, there were very few US students registered in PhD program even though they got more opportunities to receive financial support. More than 90% of the PhD students were foreigners. Over the years they undertaken heavy load of research work that very few US students want to do. A lot of high tech companies performing cutting-edge researches need to hire high-educated employees. Of course they prefer US citizens at the first place, but the fact is that they cannot find a qualified US-citizen but have to hire a foreigner. 

Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tremendous growth to the USA economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about.
