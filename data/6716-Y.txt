Marlon Ma I strongly support this rule and really believe that if United States wants to keep the lead place in the science, engineering, and technology fields, all talent no matter where he or she is from, should be provided more space and right in this country. United States have fulfilled all of achievements not by shutting the door and let so-called native talent work day and night, but by collecting strength all around the world.
