Anand Tomar, University of New Mexico Allowing STEM students to work for longer in the US than any other graduate is not justified in any case. Increasing STEP OPT even further is discouraging the international students with other majors to participate in US degree program. 

Expanding the OPT for STEM graduates allows the students to apply for H-1 visa up to 3-4 times post study whereas the H-1 cap is same which decreases the possibility of other students to get H-1 visa even further. 

I hope DHS will look into this matter and come up with a solution which does not discourage international students with other majors to pursue degree in US.
