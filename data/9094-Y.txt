I strongly support the new OPT extension for STEM students.

I came to this country 20 years ago with nothing but two suitcases, 500 dollars and an American dream. I am very grateful the United States is an open country and the land of free. I hope this continues for the generations to come. Shutting the door to oversea talents may marginally provide few jobs in the very short term, but we jeopardizing losing our future as the tech leader of the world.
