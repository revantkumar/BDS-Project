I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

My reasons are as follows:

1. It gives talented international students more opportunities to contribute to the US and instill more energy to the US market and industry.

2. It will help improve the diversity of US, encouraging the birth to many innovative ideas and development.

3. More competition encourages people to work harder and US companies could hire more intelligent and diligent employees to work for them. As a result, simulating the technology and economy development of US.
