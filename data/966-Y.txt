Micheal Wang I strongly support this rule. This role will attract more F-1 students from all over the world to US, and therefore benefit US economy a lot.

F-1 students spent a lot for their tuition fee, which is an important financial support for US academic institutions. especially for private institutions. According to a survey by Moody (http://www.marquette.edu/budget/documents/USHigherEducationOutlookNegativein2013.pdf), about 80% operating revenue of private universities is from tuition fee. US academic institutions need that money for supporting school facilities, PhD students and faculties. If the OPT extension were gone, the attraction for international students would be weaken, which means US Universities would lose a lot of revenues.

Also, F-1 students, including those in OPT, need to live in US. That means they make great financial contribution to housing, cater, transportation, and so on. As a F-1 Master student of Columbia University, I rent an apartment in Upper Manhattan. And I know that most apartment buildings in 10 blocks nearby has international student as tenants. Just imagine those landlords feeling when they found that rent became less and less, because fewer students came to US and the renting time per person were shortened as a result of OPT extension cancellation. And the same thing would happen to local restaurant owners taxi drivers, and airline companies - they would lose money if fewer international students stays in US and the average staying time become shorter.

In a word, international students made great financial contributions to the US and they should be encourage to stay in the US longer according to the new DHS rule.
