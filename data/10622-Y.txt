Alison Gu The STEM extension is beneficial to both U.S citizens and international students. It would not increase the rate of jobless people and on the countrary will lower the rate in a long term. The extension actually provides enough time for students to get used to work applying what they learned from American colleges. If the extension gets cancelled, it's harder to find a chance to practice in the U.S. However, everthing taught is under American system/standard and it's better to stay to practice for a while. The cancellation would definitely cause a negative impact on international students.
