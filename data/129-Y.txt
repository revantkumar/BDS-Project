I strongly support the OPT-extension. For those declining the proposals, they do not think through the benefit brought by international students who have earned BS or graduate degrees. 

Someone has claimed that those international students would hurt the interests of American people because of increasing competition in the market and resulting that a lot of American people have been unemployed. However, it is not the case at all. 

First, in the Federal Register, there already had one policy to protect American workers in related fields. It said,'Safeguards for U.S. workers in related fields. To guard against adverse effects on U.S. workers, this proposal would require terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity (including duties, hours, and compensation) to be commensurate with those applicable to similarly situated U.S. workers. In addition to requiring a related attestation in the Mentoring and training plan, an employer would also be required to attest that: (1) The employer has sufficient resources and trained personnel available to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection; (2) The employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough any full- or part- time, temporary or permanent U.S. workers as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student;' So the high unemployment rate has nothing to do with those STEM students. 

Second, DHS can conduct employer on-site reviews at worksites to verify whether employers are meeting program requirements. It is effective to prevent employers from hiring STEM students in a low salary instead of hiring U.S. workers in a high salary.
