I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many scholars and entrepreneurs who have achieved great success in the U.S. are once international students who studied here.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.Many international students doesn't increase unemployment for domestic citizens, on the contrary, it is the thing that those vacancies cannot be fulfilled if we only hire U.S. citizens. Competition can enhance skills for both U.S. citizens and international students and workers. That is exactly what makes us a great country in the last 100 years.
