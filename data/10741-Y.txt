The STEM OPT extension is critical for any STEM students who would like to start and develop a career in the US after graduation, so that they can implement the knowledge that they learned at school. If the STEM students do not have their OPT extension, it's a disadvantage for the employers because they would be garuanteed that the employees that they hired with an OPT will be able to get an H1B visa later. While with the extension, the chances that the STEM employees can get a working visa are much higher.
