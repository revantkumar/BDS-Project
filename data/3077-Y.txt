I am an international student. I was lucky to have got the H1B visa in the first try. But I have many friends and classmates who didn't have the H1B visa. STEM and OPT are very important for them. Many of them work in technology industry and financial industry. They work hard and contribute taxes. Retaining these high-skill workers is certainly beneficial for the competitivity of US.
