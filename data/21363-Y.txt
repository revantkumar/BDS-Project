Hi,

I am a engineer working for a tech company. I have to say that this OPT extension is definitely benefiting the U.S. as a country. Because the U.S. economy needs these international students to work because there're just not enough American citizens that have the same type of training in the STEM areas. We just don't have enough people go to study math, science, engineer, statistics.

I used to be a TA for an intro stats class when I went to graduate school in a public university. Most students who take that class think statistics is just not the thing for them. For those who don't, little of them eventually pick stats as their majors. And can you imagine how I feel when everybody I met out of school tell me statistics is boring? 

And you think companies hire international students because they are cheap? No, they are actually more expensive!! They have the same pay as everyone else and there are tons of paperwork and additional fees you need to get international students work legally. And you think the companies would
be stupid enough to not hire american citizens if there is enough labor in the market?
These companies have the smartest people in the world. So the fact is very simple, they just can't find enough talent who are American citizens.

I think the country really need more awareness on how much talent we are lacking in the STEM areas. This is why I have seen recently a lot more scholarship and funding opportunities in STEM education areas. We need to train more STEM talents. But that is going to take time, to let people realize how serious it is and start to take actions. 

But right now we need these internationals to keep our companies, industry and our economy running until we are fully ready!
