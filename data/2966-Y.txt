I think this is a great move by USCIS since, it will not only help international students will also help USA economy by bringing in international talent which would be not be the case if the STEM extension program is withdrawn.

There are numerous international students that wants to step into USA industry to get the work exposure and utilize the knowledge earned in USA without going through the H1b route immediately.
