John Shepherd I strongly support this rule. As a international student under OPT right now I deeply felt that this rule will greatly help us students and their companies. To be able to perform a complete research or project in our company it requires first some time to ramp up as a new hire then we can dive deep into the project or conduct the research. That means a project usually takes a fairly long time. With only 12 months in the OPT international students like me would be able to finish researches or project like this. And we will end up leaving the country without finish the project. It is a huge loss for a career starter not to be able to finish the very first research or project.

With added time to the OPT extension, students can have more time to finish their program, research or project. They will also have the opportunity to take a more interesting or more challenging project which typically takes more time to finish. This will be benefical for both the students and their company.
