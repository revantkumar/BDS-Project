U.S. need foreign workers for the development of the country. We can easily find both in high schools and in universities, foreign students always performance better than domestic students in academic field. Especially, Chinese are able to contribute a lot on computer science field. Chinese can write good code efficiently. Undoubtably, American student are good enough, They are good at social work, volunteer, politics. However, American society still need quantity of engineers, scientists, mathematicians. There are what foreign student can provide. 
I support the OPT extension for STEM F1 students !!!
