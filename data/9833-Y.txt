Think about how much money you have made from the international student. If the opt will not be expanded, this means that many of the international students will probably chose another country to study. 
Think about how many intelligent international students have stayed in America to do creative work. Without the expansion of opt, many of the most intelligent international students will leave America.
Think about the spirit of America. Will it be an equal and free country if the international students even don't have a better chance to stay here!?
