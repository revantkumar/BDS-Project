I am an international student and was doing internship in a small startup as a software engineer in summer 2015. This startup needs engineers to build up website, make mobile apps. The CTO told me they got zero application after they post job online and I am the first one apply this position.

This OPT extension rule obviously will benefits both US technology companies and STEM students. Technology companies require a lot engineers but number of native students can not fulfill the demand. And STEM students needs opportunities to gain industrial experience which could improve their careers.
