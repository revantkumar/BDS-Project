I am supporting this rule mainly because following reasons:

1. The extension of OPT would attract more international students to study in the United States, and this is actually a considerable income for not only the universities, but also house rental, cars dealership as well as food industry. 

2. The OPT program is beneficial to STEM sector of America economy enormously and it has attracted lots of talents from all over the world to further contribute to this country. They contributes in creating awesome products and improving quality of life of Americans. They are not stealing jobs from American citizens. Instead, they have created countless jobs for Americans through startups, keeping America at the top of world in engineering area.
