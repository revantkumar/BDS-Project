Stem OPT should be extended to 24 months.
Some people might disagree with this policy because they want to provide those positions for other American.
However, to be honestly, just come to any of Research lab. You will see most of stuff in the lab are NOT American! If they are interested in this field, they are more possible to get the position than international students.
American now are not interested in working in the lab.
Therefore, to increase research and working efficiency, it will be a good choice to extend STEM OPT.
