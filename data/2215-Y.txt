I strongly support improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students due to the following reasons:
1. Intelligence should be shared in modern society, especially for the "international intelligence". This expanded OPT policy will gather more talents from all over the world which can absolutely provide more productivity, creativity and potential for the united states and the world.
2. Technology development is critical for the US economy, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degree are working hard and have strong capability to boost this industry.
3. The long history of accumulating international talents has made the US the most powerful country in the world, there is no reason to stop expanding the wiseness of the history.
