Pengyang Zhao I support the proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension Rule. Through working in research projects sponsored by US companies and/or federal agencies, foreign students have gained sufficient professional training in universities to finally obtain a master or PhD degree in STEM. But this is no longer the end that many foreign graduates are anticipating. The journey of a master or PhD is not simply rendered by the scientific knowledge he or she has learned, but is in fact gradually crystalized into a belief of how research and innovation should be approached in the future. This belief is new and fresh, leading to many inspiring ideas that can bring changes to the companies and academic researches, where foreign students can further learn how to become a fully independent professional. This provides valuable experience to understand how scientific or business researches and projects are operating, which allows the students to build up network with the academia and business in US so that future global collaboration can be smoothly established. The US needs to provide this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension Rule for foreign students, not only to give an opportunity to them to better participate in researches in US, but also to have a change to strengthen the influence of US on the world's next generation of science and innovation, securing the leadership US has had so far.
