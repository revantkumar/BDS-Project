I strongly support this proposal. It not only will attract many talents to come to study in USA but also can greatly benefit USA's economy.
Diversity is the reason that makes USA the strongest country in the world. Those talented foreign students can bring great diversity to our society. With 24 months extension, those students can be sufficiently trained in their fields and can bring great dynamics to our economy.
