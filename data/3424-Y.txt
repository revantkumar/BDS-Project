Sai krishna Ganji Dear Mr.Johnson,
We are so glad to be a part of American educational institutions. We think its a great way to expose ourselfs and gain practical knowledge in our fields. So, do most of them spend their money tmabd come to learn their subject practically, which our countries Gail to provide us. It would be a great loss for the students ,if you don't provide the opt periods to the studnets and also financially loss to your govt. As 40% are international studneo in most of the top universities. Thank you, and hope you would understand the voice of students.
