Chia-An Chen The proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule is beneficial to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy, thus I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule. As an International student and a STEM graduate, I would like to see this rule published and implemented for highly skilled young professionals in F-1 status.
