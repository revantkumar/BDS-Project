I support the proposal. The government always want to keep the most excellent talents in US and let them make the contributions. On the other hand, a student who just graduates in the STEM area often needs certain period to adapt to his/her career. The extension of such period would give students more chances to find the job and further show their capabilities. I believe our goal is the same---we hope the most excellent talents to stay in US and we also hope to work with the most excellent talents.
