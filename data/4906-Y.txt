I strongly support the proposal because I think there are several advantages for extending the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. This counts a big part in making the United States the richest country in the world.

1. This is vital for the improvement of these many IT companies, for example, Google, Facebook, which plays an really important role in the GDP of the United States.

2. Giving more opportunities to nonimmigrant STEM students does NOT harm the benefits of the Americans, because there are so many extra job openings to be filled in these areas.

3. For my field of study, which is computer science, most of the Americans start to work after graduation from university. But graduates with higher level degrees of study such as master and PhD are in great need for the development of this field in the United States. A big fraction of foreign students are pursuing these higher degrees, so the government could just take this advantage for its own development.
