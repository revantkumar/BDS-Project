Peng Wang I strongly support the proposal for another 24-month extension to OPT.

Foreign employees are engaged in a large part of history of the United States, and have made huge contribution to the progress of this country. The booming economy and rapid development of technology have placed a keen demand for all companies of more professionally-trained employees than ever.International STEM students receive advanced education in the United States and enter local companies. This does not harm the opportunity for American people finding a job at all, given that those companies are still demanding more H1B positions. Under the trend of economic globalization, only the most competitive companies can survive and provide more jobs. Driving foreigners out and leaving more opportunities for local people may seem alluring, but this only weakens American companies and finally everybody loses their jobs. Talents are the most important resource nowadays and sending them to your rivals would definitely be the stupidest idea.
