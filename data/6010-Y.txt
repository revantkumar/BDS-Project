As a grad student majoring in Computer Engineering, I have to say expanding OPT for F-1 student brings much more benefit then you can imagine. 

For those who are stating that we international students are taking good from Americans, I think you must don't know that over 80% grad student majoring in engineering, sciences and related areas are international students! Suppose a company wants to hire a highly qualified student as their employee to work on a big project, who are the best candidates? Definitely the answer would be those international students in grad school!!! If you want to be more competitive and get a good job, then stop arguing that international students are taking away your positions! Instead please go back to college and equip yourself with the most up to date knowledge and technique and be more competitive!!!

On the other hand, many of you who oppose the extension of OPT may not know that many projects in tech companies take up to many years of work!!! If some of the team members would have to leave the country because the expiration of their visa, then how can a company make their plan and hire empoyees rationally? How are they supposed to look for another appropriate substitute person in such a short time? In the end who should be responsible for the loss of the teams and these companies? Obviously it's a huge problem that can lead to very very bad result that no one wants to see, especially those managers in tech companies who concern benefits the most.
