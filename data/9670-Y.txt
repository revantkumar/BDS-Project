Yuan Chen Well, I strongly support the proposed rule to allow qualified F1 students to extend the OPT period by 24 months. I've made a comment a few days ago, but now I'd like to add more points.

I see many negative comments saying that this rule might cause the unemployment rate to rise and will not benefit American workers. However, that is wrong, at least partial. According to the data of Department of Education, there will be an estimated increase between 14% and 62% in STEM jobs from 2010 to 2020, and there is concerning shortage in workforce in these fields. But most of the unemployment happens in labor-intensive industry where the jobs do not require much knowledge or technique. Therefore, extending the OPT period for STEM students is irrelevant to the unemployment problem in the US.

I also want to add that rather than stealing jobs from American people, international students create jobs for the US and benefit the economy. According to NAFSA, international students created or supported more than 340,000 jobs and contributed more than $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year. Besides, extending the OPT period doesn't increase the number of new immigrants. The number of new immigrants is essentially limited by the number of H1B visas issued, which is not affected by this proposed rule.
