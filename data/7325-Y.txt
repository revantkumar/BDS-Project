I strongly support with this policy.

Firstly, it is the American spirit to attract intelligent people from over all the world to get advanced education here and then make great contributions to the US and the world. OPT is a big part the education package. If OPT STEM extension is called, many international students would choose not to study here. Since education plays an important role in US economy, it would hurt the economy tremendously.

Secondly, this policy is of significant benefit to boost US economy, especially in the hi-tech industries. US owns a big amount of share in the hi-tech fields, such as semiconductor manufacturing, information technology, biomedical products, etc. These fields require highly talented and educated employees, either Americans or internationals. If OPT can be extended for 24 months, the companies can have a lot more choices while selecting candidates with perfectly matched specialties. Although US is still the leader in hi-tech, some European and Asian countries are catching up. We should not push our well-educated people to our competitors.

Finally, I believe this policy will be actually beneficial to US citizens. With above-mentioned effects on education and economy, this policy will boost the market and thus expand demand on employment, which makes it easier for US citizens to find desired jobs.
