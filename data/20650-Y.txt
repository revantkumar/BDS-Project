We should definitely SUPPORT this proposal! 

AFAIK, many international students can not even get the H1B visa to work because of Indian outsourcing companies. These companies abuse H1b visas by dirty multi-petition tricks. They shipped thousands of Indians to the U.S. each year and many of these Indians are not educated in the U.S. at all! On the other hand, for those students who get professional training and education in many top universities, they have very little possibilities to win the H1b lottery because Indian outsourcing companies will file 5-7 petitions for each of their applicants!

If we don't do something to change the situation, in the long run, those international students with degree from top U.S. universities have to go back to make contribution to their own country and the IT companies in U.S. will be taken over by those Indians! It will hurt U.S. economy because we are paving the way for other countries! This proposal can increase the chance to have more diversified STEM students stay in the U.S. and make contribution to the country. Let's support it!!
