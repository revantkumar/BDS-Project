I firmly believe that the OPT extension is so necessary for US, especially when the economy is downwards for a long time. Citizens may worry about international students brings up the unemployment, however, this is not the case. Stem students are usually working in the fields of finance, math, engineering. These fields are directly associated with the U.S economy. If OPT extension is judged to be invalid, there will be lots of students forced to leave US and work for other countries. In this case, the US economy will be severely harmed as within a short time its highly impossible to replace those positions, and not to mention company has to take a long time to train new entries. All of these dynamics will slow down the production of every department and accordingly slow down the development of economy. 
The reason i believe international students would not bring up the unemployment rates is - first, if you look at the history and you would find with more students working with their OPT, the US economy is booming and the unemployment rate is decreasing. History tells us that these talented international workforce bring talents, labors, ideas and capital to the market where it benefits the local people as well by creating more opportunities and new positions. Second, if the OPT extension fails, you will see a decreasing amount of enrollment in the US universities and colleges. Without enough students and enrollment rates, schools have to fire tutors/faculties or cut down the salaries/expenses. This will make more people lose their job. 

In this way, you can see the benefits opposed to the harms. Let's get OPT extension Pass as it will bring more long-term benefits. We should be more fore-sightseeing.
