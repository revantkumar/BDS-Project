I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons.

1. The government of USA should let the students who pursued there advanced degrees in the United States make contribution to USA with the knowledge they acquired in this country after graduation.

2. The United States of America values diversity highly. Numerous great engineers, scientists, professors who made and are now making great and continuous contribution to the USA used to studied at American Universities. They appreciated the opportunities of studying in the USA and continuously contribute there intelligence to the US society. Thus, United States can benefit more by letting expanding training opportunities F-1 students with STEM degrees for its own benefit.

3. Competition makes a society healthy and keep a country in power. The F-1 students with STEM degrees do not steal job opportunities from the US citizens. It is because for those job positions which require higher education in STEM fields, there are not enough number of US citizens. Those US citizens who are unemployed do not fulfill the requirement of such job opportunities and there are plenty of jobs for them in other fields. Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students can enhance the Competitiveness of the USA and guarantee the US citizens a better life. 

4.Once the USA is stay in power with great competitiveness, the ordinary US citizens can continuously benefit from it. Those students with STEM degrees can help to solve highly challenging problem in the United States. With their knowledge they learned in the USA, they can develop new ideas in the fields of medicine, IT industry, Basic sciences (physics, mathematics). Those ideas can promote the social development. It is good for USA and its citizens.
