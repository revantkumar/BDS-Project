I STRONGLY SUPPORT the approval of this proposal.
One of the factors that makes U.S. be the world's greatest country is that U.S. absorbing the best, the most talented people from the world. Driving out these talented and hard-working people will result in declinng of a great nation.
Recall what had happened to Detroit when the local workers opposed the import of Japanese automobile manufacturing lines and skilled Japanese workers? The Detroit workers were too afraid of competition, which is actually beneficial competition in nature, and the result of expelling talented Japanese human resources is that Detroit now becomes an abandoned city.
Some negative comments mention STEM foreign students lead to population problems to the US. I think such opinions are irrational. STEM students account for very small section of immigration population, and many of them will leave the US when their OPT periods finish. What these people who proposed negative comments should consider is the how to limit illegal immigrants, but not to expel talented people out of the country.
