I believe extending the OPT program to 24 month would not only benefit the applicant/student but also industry employers as well as the U.S.. If the OPT period is 24 month, the students can have more time to look for quality jobs and increase their chance of employment because for 24 months, they will not have to worry about work permit issues. Employers that may be underfunded can extend offer of employment to F1 students without having to worry about visa issues as well. Thus, the employers can retain talented workers who have received quality education. Also, for the U.S. economy as a whole, the U.S. can retain the bright, educated work force that are educated by the top-tier institutions in US. These student can give back to the US economy in terms of tax dollars, or innovation which will further generate wealth and tax dollars in the US instead of bringing all these possibilities back to their home country. In today's global economy, the most important, and hardest thing for an institution is to retain talent. If the US wants to continue its leadership in innovation, it must keep smart, young, hardworking people within its borders.
