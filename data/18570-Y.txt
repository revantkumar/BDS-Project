I strongly support this rule to extend OPT for international students. This country was founded on freedom, fairness and openness which lead U.S. to become the leading country in the world. I strongly believe that only by fair competition and through merit could U.S. maintain its leading position. We want to attract the best and brightest, fresh blood, new ideas all over the world. And I firmly believe that we can achieve this goal by extending OPT. 

Please support fair competition and let people who has talent to continue their American Dream.
