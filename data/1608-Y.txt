Aishen Li Lets think of this, why the United States is the most advanced country in the world? And do you know how much contribution from foreign immigrants? Look Goggle, Facebook and Amazon, they are the leads in their industry, and how many foreign works they have? Why? Because those people are the most talented people around the whole world. Yes, those companies can recruit American citizen only, but why don't they do that and choose a way that cost more? Because those F-1 student really contribute a lot for this country and make it the strongest. 
American people want the government to protect their job opportunities, that's totally correct and the government should do that, but, I don't think the U.S. should close the door for other people with better ability to do the science, that is like what China did in early 20th century. 
We all know that the 21st century is called 'global era'. That means you are competing with people all over the world. The U.S. has a big advantage in this game because of the better education system and better benefit. That's the reason U.S. can attract talented people from other countries left their family behind and go to America, these people will push the country forward, don't close your door.
