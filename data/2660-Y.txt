Paul Dunham As a manager of high tech people, I have many job openings I am trying to fill. The stream of students coming into the high tech market domestically is not enough to fill all of these roles. Allowing smart, high tech students to come to the USA to study and work is good for business. Ultimately it strengthens our economy and our country's position in the world as a leader.
