I Strongly support the OPT extension, here are my reasons.
First, if the OPT extension is approved, we will have less chance to have the next Einstein working for Nazi.
Second, if the OPT extension is approved, scholars and research faculty may not need to travel worldwide, they can have all the elite resources inside nation.
Third, if OPT extension is approved, United States can tax on more patent rather than pay to buy them.
These above are my reasons. Please support the OPT extension.
