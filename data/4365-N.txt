Are you ever going to work for the American People more importantly the citizens of Washington State. We can not put more young folks out of work when Obama gets it in his ass to screw us over once again. I know at one time you had all the people in mind when you were running for office and answered the oath of office, To uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. Have YOU even read the second most important document in the United States,next only to the Bible.
I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
