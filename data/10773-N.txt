We are being taken over by foreigners. We should be protecting US born citizens, providing more options for education, and jobs for Americans. I spent over 40 years of my life working, paying taxes, and paying into social security. Now that I'm older, disabled (but willing to work), not only have I not been able to find employment, but I'm living on just over $1000.00 social security per month. Almost half of that goes to my health insurance. 
This is not how Americans should end up...struggling every single day while foreigners get an education and jobs while also getting lowered to no taxes, not paying for health insurance, and so many other 'handouts'.
We are the United States in name only. America is falling...and no one is listening.
