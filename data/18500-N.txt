Please accept this comment on the rule proposed b y the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expand a program called Optional Practical Training (OPT). I understand that this program gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students over Americans.

It is clear that not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes.


My complaint is supported by a 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) that found there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors. The EPI study found that encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact: wage suppression in tech-related fields.

I stand up for U.S. STEM workers and American students seeking STEM careers and ask you to reject OPT.
