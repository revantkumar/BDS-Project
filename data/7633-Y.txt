Anton M This is a fairly GOOD proposal for a couples of reasons. The United States has become the most attractive destination for top STEM students from all over the world to pursue a higher degree. Besides the high quality educational program, a more important reason, I personally believe, is that the ample opportunities provided by all sorts of companies and institutions. The US is leading in many technologies due to the contributions from those excellent STEM people from all over the world. It is impossible for the US to thrive without them.
