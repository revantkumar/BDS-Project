This proposed rule is indeed a good initiative for the mutual benefits of both US employers and international talents. Advanced technology is a significant sector of US economy with the fastest growth rate, high-tech companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook require enormous amounts of intellectual resources who help contribute to overall US economy, working on the farsighted projects that could shape the future of humankind. Intellectuals who could fill in these positions are mostly college students coming from STEM, the majority of which are international students. Companies in the high-tech industry rely heavily on these foreign intellectuals such that most of the on-going projects will fall apart if they fail to obtain work authorization of appropriate length that supports the full life-cycle of most projects.
On the other hand, international students are willing to gain practical experiences from OPT that could supplement their academic knowledge. Such practical benefits will sway more international students to apply for US colleges and universities, which ultimately benefits US academic institutions for global competitiveness. 
The OPT system provides academic and practical training for international students, with appropriate regulations on immigration policy, this system does not impair the job opportunities of local employees but rather provides valuable experiences for intellectuals from all over the world working together to build up a brighter future.
