I support the STEM extension. The international students deserves fair opportunity with the other candidates. Many companies have the constrains for the international students, only hiring U.S. citizens, the positions provided to the international students are already limited. The constrains are about to become more. U.S. is a country which welcomes immigrants, that's why it could have the large pool of intellectual resources who support the development of technology. We deserve a fair chance to perform in the open society.
