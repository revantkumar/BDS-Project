S. Wang This program is obvious beneficial to all of the people in United States.With large amount of financial support to international students every year, sending so many talented students back to their countries means such a waste of money. Why dose the government support so many people from other countries without letting them serve this country properly. The abortion of this program will prevent them from building this country with the advanced technology or knowledge they have learned here. Moreover, sending these educated student back is also a potential threat to United States because other countries get more chance to access the most advanced knowledge in this world. Even for those who support this education by themselves, they deserve an opportunity to contribute what they've learned here to this country as well. America needs these excellent students from all over the world. This OPT extension program will provide a better chance for these students to serve this country.
