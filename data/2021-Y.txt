I strongly support this proposal of F-1 non immigrant student visa on opt for certain students with degrees on STEM from U.S. institutions of higher education. 

First of all, U.S. citizens are facing thechallenge to fill all the STEM related positions by themselves. It will bebenefit both U.S enterprise and STEM F-1 visa students if the new regulationgets approval, comparing with the unnecessary hiring and training cost for newhires year by year due to the F-1 non immigrant students have to leave in ashort term.

Secondly, according to the employer report,most of those F-1 non immigrant STEM students are very hard working and performquite well, whose contribution to the company is above the average and helpsU.S. economy, especially in the high-tech industry to grow.

Last but not least, the technical skills ofSTEM graduates is very competitive and critical to most of the top enterprise.With the the H1B visa lottery being more and more intense, the new regulationprovides more chance for those enterprise to keep those talents they reallyneed.
