America was and is continued to be built by immigrants. Students who have advanced degrees are essential for the prosperity of the US. DHS needs to accept this rule to not only to not jeopardize careers of thousands of students and their employers, but to help its economy grow. Since H1B lottery has become even more difficult to make, STEM OPT extension provides relief to the students and the employers. 

I feel evaluating the "The Mentoring and Training Plan" will become very subjective and needlessly onerous for the applicants.
