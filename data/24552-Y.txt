No government funded or supported employment program should give any preference to any non-citizen until it can be fully and definitively demonstrated that all U.S. citizens who have adequate skills and training have had ample opportunity to be fairly considered for such employment.

The first responsibility of government is the welfare and security of its own citizens. Given that we are currently experiencing the lowest level of workforce participation in more than 30 years why would we increase the number of non-citizens seeking employment in the U.S. When all U.S. citizens have the jobs for which they are qualified we might then consider non-citizens.
Thank you for your consideration.
