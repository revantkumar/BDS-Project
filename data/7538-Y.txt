OPT is a gateway for every nonimmigrant student to gain valuable work experience in the US and in a competitive environment. It gives the student with valuable credentials that can either be used for the advancement of the US economy or take the knowledge back to their domicile to further their career and economy. I am in favor for the DHS/USCIS proposal to implement the STEM extension for all eligible candidates.
