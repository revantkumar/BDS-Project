I support the OPT extension for STEM graduate students.
Because right now, the h1B work need the lottery system, make it harder for some graduated students to get the proper job.
Next, the two years gap will be useful for some student who want to apply for green card, during the postdoc year.

For my personal experience, I would tell the following story.
In UC systems, if hire a h1B postdoc, the salary is much higher than other categories minimum is $65000. Thus many professor prefer J1 visiting scholars. But there are still many US graduated graduates students who will do academia jobs in US needs the valid visa. H1B or OPT with extension are the only choice. Since H1B has much higher wage requirement, OPT with extension is the right choice for them. 

Thus most postdocs are under the OPT or OPT extension to perform the postdoc work. 
As a matter of factor, these highly trained postdoc jobs are not available to US citizens, because every year very few US students graduated with STEM degree. In my field physics, I can definitely say that US native students is only 10% of total graduated students.

Only foreigner international students will get these kind of under paid, but highly required techniques jobs. Therefore, base of my experience, I fully support STEM extension, without that no one will do postdoc jobs in schools.
