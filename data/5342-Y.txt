I am against the expansion of OPT for F-1 nonimmigrant students that DOH is considering right now.

The reason being is that even as a ivy league trained engineer where I graduated in the top quarter of my class, I still routinely feel disadvantaged in the job market against the many non-immigrant students here in the country.

As a first generation college student, I believe this expansion would paradoxically reduce the number of students wanted to pursue a career in Science and Technology. He or she would see that the market being flooded with wealthy foreign applicants, who could willing to take the same internship/research positions unpaid, or in the most extreme cases, even willing to pay for the privilege. 

I am fortunate considered that my university was able to offer me a very generous financial aid package throughout my time in college. But even that, I still found myself working 15-20 hours a week on part-time jobs trying to make ends meet, on top of the student loans that I have accrued.

The passage of this rule would by default make life even more harder for other recently graduated Americans engineers like me. As we could potential find it harder to repay our already hefty student loan obligation. Company could easily elect to impose wage freeze or reduction considering the market will be saturated with eager non-immigrant job seekers. 

What are people like me going to do? Should I throw out my plan of eventually owning my own place? Having enough money to start a family with my girlfriend? Or should I just defer my own American's Dream for the sake of fulfilling other non-immigrants' aspirations.

The government should focus its priority on creating a more attracting environment to encourage more Americans to take up STEM as a profession. Not to make it even harder.
