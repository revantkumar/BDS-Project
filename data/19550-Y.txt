I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1.OPT extension is one of the most attractive advantages for people choosing to invest their money in education in America. Because people cannot only learn knowledge in classes but also gain years of work experience. If OPT extension would be cancelled, the number of foreign students would decrease a lot. This will have a really bad influence on American economy.
2.Diversity is very important for U.S.A. Foreign students contributes a lot to make a really creative, lively, multi-cultural country. 
3.Competition is a good thing. Actually now the unemployment rate of U.S.A is 5%, the lowest rate in recent year. So extent OPT can provide appropriate competition to accelerate the development of U.S.A.
4.Most of foreign students are with high education degree. They have edge-cut technology skills and excellent talent. They can contribute greatly on the development of technology of U.S.A. if they can work in U.S.A.
