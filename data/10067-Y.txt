I strongly agree with it. One year is too short for a big project. It may even take nearly a year to get familiar with the system in company, and if the OPT is extended, international employees can make better contribution to the company. Three years is a good fit. Also, the OPT is a good way to keep US education competitive in the world, and attract talented people to come to US. For us international students, it's good to gain more experience before returning homeland.
