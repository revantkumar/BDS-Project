I strongly SUPPORT this rule.
1. Currently, million of international students are influenced by this opt extension rule. Without extension period, at least ten thousand will loss their jobs immediately after Feb. This will take tremendous negative impact on economics growth. Companies are not able to find such amount qualified candidates to fill these positions. Especially in technical companies which always require high and professional technical skills will face a Incredible financial loss, thousands of projects will be delayed due to talented person loss. 
2. As a immigration countries, talented persons are the most precious treasure for USA. International students represent a key source of talent for US employers. OPT STEM Extension is a significant reason to attract people comping from other countries to student in America. Also this extension help outstanding students live with legal status in US without being subject to the green card. As a institute for immigration research indicated, 30.7% of US awarded Nobel prized are garnered by persons who immigrated to the United States. Based on this data, approval of this proposal will take countless benefits to US science and tech developments.
