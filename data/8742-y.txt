Joe Davies International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. STEM graduates are creating more and more jobs for everyone. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. If this rule is not passed, foreign STEM grads will take their skills and education to their home countries, costing America the opportunity for job-creating innovation. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM.
