Fiona Liu The comment is interesting, but it is irrelevant to the proposed rule. The proposed rule is actually putting US workers in the top priority. It has LOTS of regulations on the fields that the STEM students works at, and they DO NOT coincide with the field where US workers are seeking employment in. Reading through the terms in the document is highly recommended to make comments on it.
