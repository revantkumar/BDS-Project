We have to notice that people who will benefit from the STEM OPT Extension are those who are the smartest scientists in their own country, why on earth should we let these people learn our most advanced knowledge here and go back to serve their own countries? 
What's more, some people argued that STEM OPT Extension made the US citizenship less valuable, which is kind of absurd because the value of citizenship should come from the sense of belonging of the person who's holding it. We don't need every single law in the US to emphasize how valuable a green card or an American passport can be. This is not a country of xenophobia. People who are holding their own countries passports may still want to work here and contribute to this country because this is the best place to develop their career. However they may not want to change their citizenships because they still have sense of belonging to their own countries. I can guarantee that there are a huge amount of such people who are helping building this country much more wonderful every day.
In short, this is not about immigrating or citizenship, this is about whether America is still a open-minded country that welcomes all the smart people in the world to contribute to this country we loved.
Therefore, I strongly agree with this STEM OPT Extension.
