America does not NEED the foreign workers employed here now. My daughters have degrees, student loans to pay off, and they are brighter than the foreigners being given their jobs. You are trying to strangle young Americans who have worked for these jobs, they were born for them, and give these jobs to less intelligent foreigners, but one way or another your plan won't go the way you think it will. Americans have these jobs. The pool of qualified applicants is full. If these foreign students are bright, why can't they get some jobs going in their own country?
