Short and sweet: my GIRLS prepared for years to make themselves eligibl for high tech careers. They busted their butts to score highly, to present a fabulous resume, to volunteer, to be leaders in their fields. They attended fine institutions, on scholarships, but not 100% free. After graduation, they took jobs and worked their way up in their professions.

Allowing foreigners to study here at all is a slap in the face to American kinds who need those seats in class. Allowing them to stay after graduation is an abomination and an affront to every student and every parent! To boil it down, you are telling us to sacrifice everything to educate your kids, have them sign loans in college, graduate to depressed wages driven down by foreigners, compete with them for housing, etc. and then get the privilege of paying back the student loans while your kid gets his job in sourced by a forgeigner.

Perhaps legislators need to be reminded that this is the US of America. Loyalty should be to the Americans, not the foreigners. Stop those student visas and cut off the jobs for the ones here. Make them leave as agreed, and stop importing more.
