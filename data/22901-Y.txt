This is a great initiative! I expect seeing more brilliant people from diverse backgrounds contributing to the United States.
I expect more job opportunities (what if we have another "Jobs" creating another "Apple Iphone"), more interesting life and fast progress of the country if we can have the initiative passed, giving more outstanding students the chance to stay and contribute to the country.
