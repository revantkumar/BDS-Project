I think highly of the extension of OPT Program to be extended for another 24 months for STEM students.
These groups of people are mostly majoring in mathematics and technologies, which laid the very good foundation for the other kind of services. Large technology companies, such as Google, Amazon hires talented STEM students as their new hire program and these groups of people have brought about many amazing ideas that help to create hundreds of jobs for the other people or even create some new technologies that help to improve the lives of the human beings.
Each year, there are thousands of hundreds of students from overseas come to the States to study and then work temporarily in this country. They have brought about their culture to us and this is how Americans work. We are a country that welcome everyone.
It is not true that these group of people will steal the jobs from local Americans. The job type splits and there is no conflict. They are mostly majoring in the tech areas where most of local American do not like to learn. And when we look at the employment records from each universities and colleges, it would be easier to find that local citizens or green card people are much easier than these OPT students to get a job even if their GPA or other performance are not so good as these group of people. Therefore, we cannot conclude that OPT students steal the Americans jobs. Instead, they contribute more and devote more of their effort to earn a job that most of local citizens cannot take or do not like to take. And they together form a society that help to promote the growth of the U.S economy.
I strongly encourage the extension of the rule, which will benefit the U.S for in the long term and draw more and more people overseas to study in this country and make the country stronger.
