The extension of OPT for STEM is crucial to keep US competitive.
The competition could be an issue. But the real competition is more global than just in U.S. Take my major - Physics for example, ten years ago the top research is always accomplished by American scientist. However, more and more leaders and top scientists in the field are coming from outside of U.S. A lot of them got their Ph.D degree in U.S.
The extension of OPT allows talented international students work and enhance competitiveness of US company and research institutions. The universities in U.S. spend large amount of tax money in educating international students, especially doctoral students. However, a lot of them go back to their home country and becomes global leaders in their specialised fields. Just take a look at how many papers of top science journals like Nature, Science are published by Japanese, Chinese and Indian. If we don't take the action of keeping talented internationals in U.S. today, we may lose the competiveness of our science and technology to other countries tomorrow.
