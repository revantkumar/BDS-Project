How about if we hire immigrants to take over your jobs. Just think of all the money we could save. They would probably work a 5 day work week and at a MUCH lower salary than we pay all of you, By doing that and cutting all your perks we could afford to take care of our Vets and Seniors. Come to think of it we could probably have the country running much smoother.
