I strongly believe the expand is a win win situation, or even better for the American people. I would like to ask a question first. Why for now is the U.S. the most powerful country on the earth? Why is the U.S. can play a leading role in the world? 

The Answer is its advanced technology and the people with advanced knowledge from all over the world. As we all know, new technology can be transferred into strong productivity, which will provide more jobs.
And it is the good for the American people and American society. 

It is not just about immigration policy, but the future of the U.S. If the policy push millions of people with advanced knowledge out of the U.S., the development of the U.S will be slower and the society of the U.S. will be stopped. People of the U.S. will lose their jobs, their living standard will drop. 

Is this what the American people want? Definitely NO!!! As a result, please make a correct and brilliant decision.
