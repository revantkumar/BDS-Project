It's time to to take care of Americans and not foreign graduates. There should be no increases in number of foreign students allowed to stay and work for any amount of time as long as Americans are out of work. Big business needs to be shut down and current numbers should be cut in half. This program discriminates against American graduates and should be abolished all together. It's bad enough that foreign students have access to higher education while American students do not have those options but to then allow them to remain here taking jobs from citizens is rediculous. They pay no taxes are not citizens and should be sent home immediately after graduation. Stop issuing visas to our enemy's and strengthen our country by providing jobs to our own and prosecuting big business that hire illegals or send work overseas. It amazes me that the people that want these programs call themselves Americans and patriots. They are neither and should also be prosecuted.
