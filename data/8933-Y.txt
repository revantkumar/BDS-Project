Senger Chen I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposed rule. 

As a former international student and now an international worker under H1B visa, i truly believe these valuable students are utilizing what they have gained from U.S. universities to benefit U.S. economy. Personally speaking, i am a modeling analyst working at a commercial bank of U.S. We utilized our knowledge to build useful models in order to prevent banks being badly damaged from financial crisis. However, more than 80% colleges, who are engaged in managing the financial risks, are international students. Without STEM OPT extension policy, I can not believe U.S. will still attract so many foreign STEM talents to study and work for U.S. because they probably would choose other counties with better policy to foreign students. Without STEM OPT extension policy, U.S. employers, especially IT and financial institutions, would definitely suffer a great loss.

Consequently, I strong believe that OPT extension policy will benefit both international students and the US. I sincerely hope that people who holds negative opinions will see the huge benefits from a different perspective.
