I really do not think the OPT extension would be a beneficial policy for both US and international students. If it gets approved, more international students would just take the advantage of it to get a 3-year working experience in US in order to place them in a better place when they are back to their home countries for career. Also, for international students, they would tend more transfer to computer science and in turn pose more pressure in this area, which is not beneficial for US domestic students.
