I completely agree afree with the proposed rule. Upon implementation, this rule will help the american conpanies to hire skilled workers to do their work and thus help the american economy to grow. America has always been from the beginning a country open to immigrants and this rule strenthens it. If America needs to remain the most powerful nation in the world, it needs to help grow its own economy by helping its companies grow.
