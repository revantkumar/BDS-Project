There are some reasons that I strongly agree this rule 
First of all, The United States has regarded as a greatest country in the world because of it's diversity of different cultural. And each person are equal in this fertile land. The talented student deserves more time to emprove their skill here after they graduated. 
Secondly, It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area.
Finally, it's good for US education since longer OPT be announced. More and more talented people will coming here.
