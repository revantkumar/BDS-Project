I strongly agree that this rule should be approved since it will bring plenty of benefits to America with no doubt.
I stand at the opposite side as those people who enumerate those cons that will bring to residents. Based on their reaction, I don't think the development of the country, especially the technology, really matters to them. They are always consider what is good for their purpose and fear of competition. I think I don't need spend time to state that how competition can facilitate the development of technology. So how can a country count on those people who are afraid of competition and make their country fail to attract the knowledge from the world for the sake of their benefit? Also, it is not hard to see how the technology changed our life so far, especially the internet. And they also innovate the way that traditional industries works and provide them with new energy. And that is the evidence that providing opportunities for engineers from the world can benefits the development of a country. And that is the thing those protesters pretend to not see.
So I think there is no reason to negate this proposed rule since I can't find even one advantage from the perspective of the country.
