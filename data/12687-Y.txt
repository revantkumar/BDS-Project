The meaning of OPT and STEM OPT is to help the country to hold the students with stem degrees and experienced professionals to stay in the states. Stopping the new rule can NOT impair the employment of the citizens. STEM students contributes a lot to the high tech companies and created job opportunities as well.

What we should do is to regulate the E-verify process and stop some consulting companies like Infosys etc to import labor directly from other countries. This will affect the labor market in the states. Overall the OPT is a good thing, either in the short or long term
