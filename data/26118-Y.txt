I support expanding training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students, which will enhance the competence of U.S to attract foreign students. More foreign students will bring both economy growth and cultural prosperity. The tuition fee and living expenses of foreign students contribute a huge amount of money to the university and surrounding areas. In addition, foreign students bring different cultures and diversity into U.S society and facilitate cultural exchange among countries.
