I would say this is a great proposal! OPT-STEM would not only benefit international students who needs lots of "industrial training" but also United States for the contribution the students have made. Extending it from 17-Month to 24-Month would increase the flexibility for international students when they make a career plan.

For me I am an international student studying computer science and I have a short CPT internship experience at a tech company. Compared to a similar company in my home country, this company has better management, uses up-to-date technology, and holds a better working atmosphere. I'm saying this because I really appreciate this piece of experience and I would like to experience more as a full-time worker. Obviously, for a STEM student, 12 Months OPT would only be enough for you to get started. To work on an exciting project and make great contributions, we need more time. We need OPT STEM Extension.

In all, I believe lots of international students as well as lots of great companies that are willing to hire international students would benefit a lot from this proposal.
