Darien Zhang I strongly support OPT extension because of the following reasons.
1. Personally I could apply for European Universities but I ended up studying in the US. OPT is by all means a most crucial factor in my decision. Most of my international student friends have similar thoughts and one of my classmates dropped out of a top university in Switzerland and took a gap year to apply for the University I am studying in. Longer OPT is a very competitive condition for the American academic sectors. Academic Institutions can attract more top students from around the world and keep at a high level with OPT as an attractive factor.

2. OPT should be longer since some projects take longer than the period of OPT. Awkward situations happen when the companies find a leading character of an important project have to leave the company because of short OPT can be frustrating. To save costs for the American companies for hiring international students to make the companies operating well, there should be as low visa related barriers as possible.

3. Even in the academic institutions, projects in STEM is typically longer than two or three years. The duration of National Science Foundation, for instance, can take about three years. Since STEM OPT extension aims to provide students opportunities to participate in real projects, it might be better if the period of OPT can be longer, at least able to cover a complete research duration.
