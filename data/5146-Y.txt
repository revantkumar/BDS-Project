I strongly SUPPORT this proposal.

Foreign STEM students are NOT illegals, instead, they are well educated engineers/scientists, and they DO pay taxes.

They spent years in universities in the US, some form their families here, some find new lives here. When they go out to find a job, soon they realize they are mistreated, even they have more experience.

It is ridiculous and shameful that companies select people who have the citizenships, not knowledge and experience.

This proposal will help a lot to avoid this mistreatment and discrimination.
