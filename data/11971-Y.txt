If you go to a job fair at your school, you'll know that employer DO prefer American students. Most of them don't even hire international students at all due to expensive fees involved in visa sponsorship. An employer hires an international student only when they feel that it's worth the effort to sponsor him/her, when he/she is good enough to be a highly valued team member in that company. OPT only lets in the brightest minds to this country, so it's good.
