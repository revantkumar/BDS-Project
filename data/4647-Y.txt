OPT extension for student with STEM Degrees is absolutely needed for supporting the United States' competitive advantages in technology and science among all developed countries. Innovative projects and science researches usually require long-term investment in terms of time and money. With only 12 months OPT, organizations are unwilling to hire foreign talents. 

Certainly you can argue that the opportunities should be reserved to local talents. However, the fact is that, in order to create and maintain such a blooming economy significantly contributed by high tech companies, the United States definitely requires to import skillful workforce from foreign countries. Aborting this policy with no doubts will result in huge gaps of talent workforce dedicating to technology and science development and will push away talents, who are cultivated by the U.S. academic institutions, to look for a place where immigration policy welcomes them. The consequence will be severely harm the United States' strong position and damage the economy growth.

Given that the assured devastation will be caused by irrecoverable shortage of talent workforce in decades, providing a welcoming environment for reasonably attracting talents, who are allowed to prove their contribution and convince the U.S. employers to sponsor H-1B visa in 3 years, is clearly a right immigration policy to American people and the government.
