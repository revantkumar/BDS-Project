I approve the Department of Homeland Securitys proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. That is because STEM graduates has made 
obvious contributions to the US economy, especially in High-tech or advanced engineering field. They are always hard-working and friendly to people. The program would benefit foreign students when they return to their home countries. At the same time, it will be very helpful for US economy to be prosperous.
