I absolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new STEM OPT 24 month extension.
The international students bring huge benefits for US, especially for those industrial fields which hire STEM academic students. The international students boost our economy and their presents bring more possible employment opportunities. They work hard, work great and pay many taxes. The STEM students support our STEM industries, without them, the entire industry will suffer from a huge blow!
The statistics show that more than 85% of the students of EE and CS major are from other countries. If STEM extension is cancelled, all the well-educated talents would be effected and this chain reaction would hurt all the way from the academic performance, university region local economy, high-tech industry, finally, to the backbone of our nation's innovation ability and competitiveness! If 85% of the STEM students lose their OPT, That means that our STEM related industry would lose 85% of good employees! 
STEM students never take jobs from US citizen because 99% American citizens are even not STEM majors!
STEM student never lower the basic wage standard! Administration needs to regulate illegal and unqualified immigrants, not talented legal STEM students who bring up economy growth, innovation ,vitality and potential job offer to US!
