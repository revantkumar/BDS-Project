Amy Gao I support this program. As a small IT business owner, I can attest to the shortage of workers in STEM field. The education in this country has problems, for one, children are encouraged to pursue purely what they like, without any regard to what the society needs. But before the education issues can be fixed, let's at least alleviate the technical worker shortage problem by extending STEM OPT. Having more technical workers also increases the United States' competitiveness in the global market place, which is obvious.
