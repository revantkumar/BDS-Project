OPT extension is really beneficial to not only the students with STEM degree but also the U.S.

It can provide opportunities for students who graduate from university to accumulate experience and they actually contribute to this country a lot. The government should offer more opportunities to allow them be able to work in this country rather than letting them leave because of nonsense protectionism. 

International students with high-tech related degree have more abilities to contribute to U.S. and a many of them want to stay here and work. It is regrettable of talent drainage from this country.
