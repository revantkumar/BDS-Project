I strongly SUPPORT this ruling. There are so many students working as OPT in US. If they don't have the chance to get H1B visa while OPT period, they must leave US after working just two years, which is a really huge damage to lots of companies and US economy. If they have longer time working here, even though they leave US in the future, they have already made contribution to their companies and US economy, which benefits everyone.
