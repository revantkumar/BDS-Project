I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

Some of the negative voices assume the opt extension proposal will cause a more serious working pressure. However, it actually can fill in the void in the US tech industry. As we all know, the STEM opt extension policy has been executed for a few years before, however, theres no opt extension in other majors. This is because, the current local tech talented people can not fulfill the big requirement of both big and start-up tech companies. Actually, the high tech companies need talented people not only from US citizen but also all over the world to build a better products and make our life better. Imagine if the high tech companies stop their pace to make amazing products because of the lack of human resource, it will also have very big negative influence on the US economy. Bad economy brings high unemployment rate. Then it may start a bad cycle.

Besides, some of the comments believe one-year opt is long enough for the students to master the technology studied in school. However, as we know, STEM is much more difficult for students to be proficient. Even if business and liberal arts students need one year opt, students in STEM absolutely need more time to consume knowledge. I can not say if 2-year extension is a real time for the students, but at least more time should be given to STEM students.

Ive heard some voices from citizens who simply object this proposal. I can fully understand them because I also dont like not only foreigners even people from other cities stay and work in my hometown. This is because they have different culture from mine which is leaded by different environment we grew up. However, as a rational person, I can not judge things only by my temper because thats so fractious. I hope everyone can take a sense of balance to think about this proposal and make a good choice.

In general, the proposal will bring more benefits although it will also bring some side effects.
