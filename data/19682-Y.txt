Blocking foreigners so as to leave all CS, EE, STAT, finance jobs to the American people? I believe they would probably screw up the whole thing, although they seem to be overly confident as shown in these "submitted comments".

I don't intend to become prejudiced but just kind of shocked by the overwhelming "pride" shown in the comments: how could they be so confident even when most of them didn't have a clear idea of integrating a simple polynomial after the college study(I learned from my IVY undergrad experience).
