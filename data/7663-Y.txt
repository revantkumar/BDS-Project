OPT extension is important to US technology development and also international students. 

The practical training gained from industry experience during OPT significantly improve the hands-on skill of students studying technology related majors. And the same time, great amount of technology companies can benefits from the contribution produced by the talented and well educated international students. Many of the students performs so well that the companies decided to further sponsors them applying H1 visa. All of these companies, including Apple, Google and etc., will face great loss of human resources if the OPT period is reduced. 

For all above reasons, I support the OPT extension!
