Ruiting Qu As a STEM student, I strongly support the newly proposed rule for the following reasons.

1. International students have made and are continually making great contribution to the nation in their field of study and in the industry as well. STEM are critical not only for the US,but also for other nations that are seeking quick development in technology, science, engineering and math. For many STEM major students like myself, the main reason whey we choose US is that institutes, universities here have competitive academic capability. Admitting more international students who are smart, with talent in their field will make the programs even strongly. This will bring about positive impact to universities, the nation and everyone who lives here in a long run. 

2. There are many different countries students can choose to pursue good education. What makes US extremely outstanding is that it offers the opportunity for excellent students who are employed by E-verify companies and working in their field of study to gain more experience before going back to their own country. It is a win-win thing for both the student and the companies, since it is a good way to bring the talent on board,to make the knowledge into value, to improve economy nationwide and to guarantee diversity.

3. When applying for OPT extension, the student should first get a job from E-verified company, and they must be woking in their field of study, so it is pretty obvious that they are qualified for the job. And as far as I know, STEM students all get paid equally for the equal job. We should all be clear that International students getting less wage during internship than full time employees is not the same thing of companies paying less for them. 

I do admit that competition exists. But based on these three opinions above, we can draw a safe conclusion that offering extension for STEM students will benefit the nation in a holistic view.
