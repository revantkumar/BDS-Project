I am an international PhD student in computer science. I think OPT is the most important reason I chose to do my PhD in the United States. It makes the graduate programs not only provide courseworks and research but also opportunities to meet the industry. Universities in the Europe are more affordable and there it is easier to get your degree. But they don't provide the same opportunities as OPT extension for the STEM. If this rule is no longer valid, I think the US universities will lose lots of their attractiveness to the international STEM students, which will harm the industry eventually.
