I strongly support this rule, although I don't need OPT extension to stay in US. As a Ph.D. In economics, my point of view are as follows.

1. They provide large amount of tax to federal and state governments. US government really needs that amount of money to maintain social welfares such as seniors' retire pension which is very important to the stability of one country.

2. Since STEM people are smart, young and well educated, it is good for US population structure, comparing with those non filed immigrants. And I guess that is the reason why our government keeps this rule for years.

3. I believe our government doesn't want to keep those intelligent high tech people out of America, because now relying on those IT experts, a tremendous high tech empire is built in US. Why don't we accept them and enjoy those benefits they provide
