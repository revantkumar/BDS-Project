We do not need more foreign workers in this country! There are so many American citizens who have graduated in S.T.E.M. fields but cannot find a job in those respective fields. These jobs are supposed to be good paying jobs and are absolutely meant for the American citizen. This is a disgrace to our country, to turn its back on the American worker who built this country. If these CHEAP foreign workers are so smart, then how come they need more time to TRAIN? This is just a scam against the middle class. Social security and Medicare will absolutely be affected because these foreigners will not pay into it. You are hurting the economy by this unethical backdoor crap!
