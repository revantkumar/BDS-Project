Honestly, I am an international student. The reason why I chose to get my master degree in US is that the academics in US represent the highest level around the world, especially in my field--Biotechnology. I have never meant to compete with local citizens. As far as I know, not every eligible person is willing to work in the lab, because of the salary level and over-time working. I just want to spent this time (OPT) to gain a nice working experience. The previous OPT is too short for a graduated student to finish a promising project. Basically I waste my time to do something that I cannot get any results. If I have to leave without finishing my project, why should I apply for this OPT at the first place? If OPT get extended, I believe this would attract more educated people to serve high-tech companies in US, especially some middle or small companies. This OPT extension is allowing people like me to make contribution to US. That is why I support the extension of OPT.
