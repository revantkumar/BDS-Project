I strongly support this proposed rule since this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students who attained or is going to attain STEM degree in US. Most of all, tech companies in the US depend on international students to work for them and create values. In result, it will contribute a lot to tax for IRS. On this hand, it will also benefit each US citizens here. Int regard to education industry, it will be an incentive for more international student to come here and study. In return, with way higher tuition fee than US citizens, universities and schools can get more earnings. In this case, more fund can be used to support research and students. For international students, this propose will provide a good opportunity to apply what they learned at school.

So, if people really need something to worry about, this is what they are supposed to worry about: why not spending more time improving their own skills set those companies are looking for instead of wasting time leaving negative comments here? Competitions are everywhere in the world. Tech companies will never hire you if you are not qualified regardless of your citizenship! Only the strong survive!
