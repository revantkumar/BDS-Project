The duration of an extension cannot br limited to a shorter period, due to the durations of research commonly ongoing in STEM fields. Affording greater participation in STEM training through changes to the period of the STEM OPT extension would also help the nation and its academic institutions remain competitive in light of global efforts offering international students longer post-study training experience without restrictions on the type of work that may be performed.

Take myself as example. I major in biostatistics and intern in a medical research institute. A typical development on a new drug including clinical test lasts 5 years at least. The main group member are not citizens. If we lose legal status due to limited OPT, many programs will be suspended. This would definitely lead to recession in medical area.

In addition, attracting more international students to study in States is welcoming by most US citizens. My landlord benefits from earning rent, local merchants gain profit. The final winner is US educational system. The tuition for international student is pretty high, which effectively offsets the deficiency of fund and even start some new construction.

As I'm a Chinese STEM student and was born and living there, I would return back China eventually. Before then, I'd like to apply my knowledge learned from US university to US high-tech industry development. If I have about 3 years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.

Hope more people support this good rule!
