1. There Will be More F-1 Students Which is Good For US Economy

Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students makes US colleges becoming more attractive to students who live in the other countries. Therefore, more foreign students will come to the US, which is good for the US economy.
