I strongly support the new proposal.

Since recently I went through many comments posted by those who object the new proposal. Their reasoning, to me, is just not logical. The reason why they did not support the new proposed rule is because the new rule, if passed, wlll bring more pressure to the American citizens' employment and so on. However, everything has two sides, so what we need to do is to seek the balance between positive and negative side of the rule. Think about how much the new immigrants contribute to the economic development, how much the new immigrant contribute to the diversity of the country which will in turn help develop the greatness of the country. If it were not the contribution that the immigrants made to the technology deveopment, the highly advanced network or websites (like Facebook, Uber...) would had been developed slower; if it were not the tax and huge amount of consumpton that the new immigrants made, the infrustructure advancement would not be as good as they are now. So, I strongly support the new proposal aiming at contributing to the wellbeing of the country as a whole exactly.
