This is a great proposal,and it's very nessary.

For a STEM major, the intership at leat takes six months. And for these major a project can take months to years, it's not realistic to finish it within one year for everyone, not even for small part of people.

So If this proposal won't be passed, the US companies will hire less international students.

And this is not good for US economy!!!

For each international students contribute $30,000 to $100,000 per year. They normally study two to seven years. That's $60,000 to $700,000 for one international students can contribute to US.

And the reason they come to US, it's not only for learning knowledges, but also for gathering forgien working experience.

If less of them get hired, less of them will come to US. If you see the big picture, US will loss billions of dollars incomes every year.

So, if we don't want US lose billion dollars income every, we have to let this proposal pass.
