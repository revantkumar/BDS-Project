I strongly support the new OPT extension policy.

International students should not be responsible for citizen's job losing. STEM students like us have high education degrees from United States and we are well-paid by companies, who contribute a lot to the community and American economy. It makes no sense to say that STEM students steal the job from citizens. It is ludicrous to chase talented international students educated in United States away.
