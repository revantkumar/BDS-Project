Tongxin Zhang I totally support the proposal. Because I believe it's a great way to improve the competition of America and to stand the spirit of this nation. 
First of all, OPT Extension provides a great chance for those with high level education degree to make contribution in this nation.Lots of universities of U.S.A spent a bunch of resources, money, and time to educate and train a great professional, especially in STEM, and it is too costly and unwise that forcing them back to their own country. 
Secondly, the international student with OPT did not take job from hands of American, the jobs they take is only because those companies can not find suitable citizens for that position. Which is also the reason why we have OPT program initially. 
Besides, international professionals can diversified the group of companies, professionals with various background provides different minds for the same problem, and also can help them handle international business. And it's why so many students want to come to study in US, not only the universities can provide high quality education, but the system can give them an opportunities to apply what they studies. Which inversely strength the competition of American companies.
