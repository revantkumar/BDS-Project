Keeping immigrants with STEM degrees in the United States will allow them to continue to contribute to the highly profitable leading tech industry within the United States. We all know that every country has a very limited number of highly talented people. Deporting a huge number of highly talented people from the United States after their OPTs expire will definitely harm various American STEM industries, for reasons that:

a. Employers will lose very talented STEM employees previously in OPT status that employers have invested a substantial amount of money and labor to hire.
b. Employers will need to invest another substantial amount of money and labor to hire people to fill vacancies created by departing OPT employees. This will have direct negative impact to both the employers budget and project/product timelines since the employers will need to spend time and money on the new employees training/on boarding process.
c. We can NOT assume that there are enough qualified American employees to fill the vacancies created by departing OPT employees. As a result, we can NOT assume there are enough qualified American STEM workers to supply the huge demand of STEM hiring market.
