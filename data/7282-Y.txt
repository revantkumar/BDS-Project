I strongly SUPPORT the OPT extension issue. Those people who are opposed to this issue should really consider what foreign students bring to them and why many foreign students want to choose America as a place for their further study. I am a foreign student. The reason for my choosing America to launch my further study is that there are many opportunities to get training in American industry. In this world, American industries offer the most training opportunities comparing with other countries. And it's the training opportunity in industry that attracts me to choose America to study instead of Canada or countries in Europe. If we don't get the chance to get Training Opportunities in America, there will not be any attraction for me to study in America any more. Those people who only see that foreign students take away their job opportunities should reflect themselves. They don't have fierce competition and don't consider how to work hard to compete for a job but blaming others who try their best to fight for a good future. These short-sighted people don't do any help to the development of America. Consider that if more and more students go to other countries to study instead of America. is this what they really want? Will this truely help the development of America?
