Why are you proposing to spend more American tax dollars to provide companies incentives to train foreign students? This money could be better spent to retrain existing American workers and American students.

I work in IT for a large company. Budgets are tight and training is limited. With this proposal you are encouraging these companies to accept American tax dollars to train foreign workers with the current technology skills. These foreign students are then allowed to stay in America and displace American workers who are eager to learn the skills that these same companies will not provide to their current employees.

If you wish to provide incentives for Practical Training why not train displaced American workers or continuing education for American workers?

This plan simply puts American workers behind foreign workers both in skills and employability.
