I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1.It will make U.S. companies' technologies can lead in the following 30 years. 
2.The U.S. government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.
3.3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. Most of international students gain low salary but do more contribution to the U.S.
