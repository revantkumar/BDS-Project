I strongly agree support the extending and improving for OPT.
At the moment, almost every STEM student benefits from extending OPT. In return, United States is now equipped with most advanced science and technology. This not only benefits the academia but also the industry. Therefore an extending OPT will keep more STEM student to devote for this beautiful country.
