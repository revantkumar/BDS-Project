I strongly agree with the cost benefits analysis of the proposed extension program. I think it will help create more jobs in the long run. I also believe that it DHS should add additional checks to ensure that its programs are not misused.

My first recommendation is that DHS should consider making the extension applicable to students from Accredited and Public/Non-Profit colleges. So that it does not create wrong incentives for profit oriented schools to recruit more students by promoting their educational programs as employment programs. DHS should consider using the same list of college as the H1-B advanced degree quota.

My second concern is about efficiency of mentoring program in a consulting situation. The proposed employer mentoring and training program may not be work in a consulting type work arrangement where the hired OPT student does not works directly with the employer but is working for a client in a remote location. DHS should include how the mentoring program will work in such situations.

Thirdly, I believe that DHS should make the proposed checks applicable to all OPTs. The proposed checks and safeguards should also apply to the first 12 months of OPT and OPTs issues in college to maintain continuity. The mentoring and training program should apply to all STEM OPT programs.

Lastly, the assumptions used to assess the impact on current employment in "Regulatory Impact Analysis OPT STEM - October 2015" document are not complete. The impact of the OPT extension cannot be looked at it by itself. It should also include the impact of all prior OPTs issued to the student including OPTs issued when in college. The more students US attracts because of the proposed extension, will also result in higher OPTs issued for the first 12 months and also OPTs issued in college. I strongly believe that with the right assumptions, the percentage of STEM OPT students in STEM employment population will be significantly more than 0.19 percent.
