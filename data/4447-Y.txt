I strongly support this policy.
Firstly, this policy will attract more foreign students come to study in United States, to let Universities and Colleges have more money for their researches.
Secondly, students who come from foreign students are better than their peers actually, if they can get jobs to work in United States, will definitely improve economy and technologies for United States.
