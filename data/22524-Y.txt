Immigrants in no way hamper the opportunities for the locals. It is always a healthy competetion when we put up our best against those from around the world. Besides, we bring in multi cultures, lifestyles and what's best in all our countries. Without immigrants, a country would be boring, holds good either if it's India or the USA or any nation to that matter. Talking about the STEM extension being made to 24 months, is a reasonable decision as it would give the F1 students a great shot at H1B visa, as I personally know many friends who faced lot of tension, would now be relieved. Thanks to the DoHS for taking this initiative and we strongly support this.
