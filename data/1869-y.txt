Fanyi Li I think the extension of STEM could be one of the most exciting news ever happened to the US within several decades. With a longer time students can work in the US, there would be more and more talented people who want to pursue a degree in United States and dedicate there knowledge to help generating more and more creative ideas, completing more hard scientific projects, thus help boosting the US economy. And once the economy goes better, there would be more occupations for companies to post and companies can then hire more unemployed citizens.
