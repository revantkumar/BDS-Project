If the U.S. indeed needs the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training? The DHS/industry narrative is that the U.S. lacks sufficient workers with STEM training, while the foreign workers are supposedly already trained.

And, if workers with such training are indeed needed, why wont these special mentoring programs be open to Americans? Why just offer them to foreign students?

Since DHS admitted that its motivation in OPT is to circumvent the H-1B cap, does that mean that if the cap were high enough to accommodate everyone, these same foreign students wouldnt need training after all?
