I don't understand how people, who claim to be loyal Americans, can, in good concience, take a job away from an American worker and give it to a foreigner just to save a few bucks. In the case of the Home Depot example, they expect Americans to buy their products despite giving their jobs away to foreigners. How do they sleep at night?
