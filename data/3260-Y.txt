This is a great proposal and will definitely strengthen the US's position in the world as the top choice for talented students to pursue their degrees and start their career. The extended "Extension period for STEM students" may help lessen the pressure of the current H1B lottery system and would provide a better practical training for foreign students. However, it would be even better if there could be a second extension period for qualified STEM students (e.g. working in a renowned organization or company), or increase the quota of H1B visa to properly fit the increased number of foreigners who want to have extended authorization to work in US and contribute to the US's economy.
