United States is in its most critical time recovering from 2008 financial crisis. And STEM students are one of the major forces who help build US economy. With very minimum cost, employers can have the most talented minds in the world. I am a STEM student and currently work for a Automotive OEM. There are many employees like me in my company like me. We are young, we are energetic and we are building the future of the company. One can imagine it would be a disaster if a company like mine lost all F1 STEM students. So it is great importance to improve training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees.
