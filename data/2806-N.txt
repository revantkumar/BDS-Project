I saw the results first hand working at GE and saw how the foreigners were treated. One I worked with closely told me that they shipped him over for a year, wouldn't let him travel home to visit his family, and packed 8 of them into a cheap apartment with 2 cars between them. It was almost like slavery without the bull whips for discipline.

They were also paid well below the going rate but it allowed GE to save a bundle and not have to hire those PITA Americans who expect fair treatment, vacation and all those other things they get away without paying for. It should have been and probably was illegal but the guys (and gals) from India couldn't complain and keep their jobs to support their families.

Obviously the Clinton administration went along with this just like Obama is trying to give all the American jobs to illegals.

This is fraud at it's worst and there are thousands of skilled Americans willing to take the jobs but not at the substandard wages they pay the foreigners.
