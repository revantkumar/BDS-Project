Dear Officers and Readers,
I strongly support this proposal on OPT Extension for international students who majored in STEM. This policy is a win-win for both American and international students. While many commenters already explained the benefits of STEM on diversity, technology, and economy, I would like to add another point into this discussion.
Suppose OPT Extension would be cancelled next year, many international students with high skills and professional knowledge on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math would have to leave United States and go back to their home country. They will remember this shame, join a local company, and contribute to their own country afterwards. Currently, most top technology companies (e.g. Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple) are located in United States; however, ten years later, these top companies would either move their major departments outside America or would be replace by companies from other countries. At that time, even if US government wants to reactivate OPT Extension policy, nobody would stay. Many people would think my prediction is malicious and irrational, but Detroits current status adumbrates the further of Silicon Valley and Wall St. The only solution is to extend the OPT.
As a patriotic foreigner in US, I personally hope the OPT Extension could be cancelled for the goodness of my home country. I wouldnt use OPT Extension even if its not cancelled, and I will leave America after getting my degree. However, many international students with STEM major love America and want to learn from, work in, and contribute to this country. So, standing in their shoes, I strongly support this proposal and hope international students could have longer OPT Extension. 
Best Regards.
