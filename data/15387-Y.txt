I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. Some of those students may have considered the opportunities offered by the STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the United States. Take me as an example, Im a Chinese student who already have a masters degree in Chinas top 9 University. The only reason Im still willing to purchase another masters degree in United States is because I can get 17 month OPT extension after my graduation, and then I can have longer period of time for my job hunting in United States. My career goal is to find a software developer job in United States. If the U.S. government denied this 24 month OPT extension, study in United States will be totally pointless to international students like me. The only thing that United States attracts me is that I can use the OPT extension to find a job in U.S. and have more chance to get the H1B work VISA during 24 month OPT extension. If the OPT extension no longer exists, we as international students will have very little possibility to get H1B VISA even if we find a job in U.S. Working in U.S. will become a dream that never come true and international students will have no reason to choose United States as the NO.1 place to study in.
