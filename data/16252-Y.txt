I do strongly support proposed rules. Even it will be good if 48 month extension in spite of 36 month. Student who came here are meritorious and hard worker. They also help US education system as a research or teaching assistant. I don't think they steal US jobs. They are highly talented and inventor individuals. They help new innovation and creates jobs for future generation. Thank you DHS rule making authorities for your right decision.
