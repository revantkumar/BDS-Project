It is important that OPT extension is retained for STEM student for the following reasons:
1. There has been a great demand for labour in the tech sector, which are the largest employer's of STEM students. Looking at how much GDP growth is contributed by the tech sector, it is definitely beneficial to the U.S.
2. STEM students are people with high demanded skills, who are contributing to the economy, paying tax, instead of using social benefits.
3. All jobs have been preferred to US citizen upon similar qualification already. At least in my company, the HR department has to prove that they cannot find a US citizen with similar qualification. It does not make sense that STEM students are taking jobs from US.
