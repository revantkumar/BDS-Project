I support the new rule of extending OPT STEM extension to 24 months as it will give the students a broader perspective and practical experience.US has very good number of schools that offer various programs(STEM) that are being taught based on US industry and market perspective,foreign students work very hard to get into such schools to gain knowledge and implement what they have learnt.Knowledge without implementation is useless.Hence,students should be given chance of gaining practical experience in existing industry for at least 3 years.It encourages more number of students and it is beneficial to US market and for industry growth.I strongly oppose the statement that foreign students are responsible for lessening opportunities to local workers because if there is talent and competition spirit no one can stop you from doing what you want.Technology is not stagnant.Development in any field has not reached any threshold.There are lot of opportunities and lot more ways of innovation is needed which requires lot of workers.There are lot of foreign graduate students who are capable of coping up with the change.If we take statistics into consideration, international students who do Masters and Phd in US universities are way higher than the locals.So the rule is beneficial to create more opportunities and economically US and OPT experience wise students both will benefit from this proposal.

Thank you.
