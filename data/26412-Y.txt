I Strongly SUPPORT this proposal. Here I am providing my opinions to one of the negative comments. 

Some people are against this proposal because they think foreigners have taken a lot jobs that should belong to US workers. This is not related to this proposal, because the situation associated with this proposal is quite the contrary: US is in short of STEM workers! This means there are more STEM positions than US workers who hold STEM degrees. In order to tackle this short of STEM workers, this proposal needs to be approved. Only by doing this, US companies can keep hiring STEM workers to keep the companies operating properly.
