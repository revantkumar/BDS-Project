From my perspective, I strongly support OPT-extension.

For years, a great many high-tech workers have been made a huge contribution to US. Those experienced employees could be a boost to not only economy but the entire territory of technology. Many of them, however, with talent but less luck, have to leave the place where they intend to thrive. It could be a tremendous loss for US, and potentially made the industry stagnant.

Besides, according to my knowledge, US is a multi-race country. It develops quickly in consequence of the combination of different cultures and novelty. Therefore, it is not wise to cancel the extension.
