I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. The approval of this new rule will definitely help a lot to the American academic sectors. As an international student from China, I came to US last year to pursue my graduate study. One of the most significant reasons that I chose US as the foreign country is that not only US has cutting-edge science and technology, and innovative academic mechanism with great reputation, but also US provides training opportunity in the real industry after graduation. The opportunities that the OPT provides are really appealing, which attracts more talented student with strong academic background coming to US to study. So the OPT extension will contribute a lot to the economy, academy and technology in US. 
If the extension is denied, it will affect lots of technology companies negatively. Most of these companies hire lots of foreign students. Without enough time doing their jobs in the companies, they have to leave with unfinished projects and tasks, and the companies have to continuously hire more and more new employees, which is exhausting and inefficient, and will significantly affect the development of technology in US.
