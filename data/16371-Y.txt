I'm glad that DHS propose this rule. 
Each year, foreign students working in OPT extension have made huge contributions to the US economies. Without them, the US can lose hundreds of billions of dollars income each year, and many IT company may have to facing the difficulty that they cannot find enough qualified employee. 
Also, please remember that not all foreign students can find a job after they finishing their study. Lots of foreign students cannot find a job, and comparing to the native Americans, it's even harder for them to find the same job with the same skills.
Finally, OPT extension attracts lots of foreign student to study in this country which also generate hundreds of billions of dollars income each year.
