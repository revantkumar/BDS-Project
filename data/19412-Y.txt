I have worked in the technology field for over 15 years. Wages have not only stagnated, they have declined. I have seen over and over how technology companies use foreign workers to displace Americans. I have seen over and over how technology companies move their operations to countries that pad their bottom line. Technology companies do not care about the workers or the USA; they care about making more money for themselves. Foreigner come to the USA for free educations that are not available to USA students. The USA has been selling out American students and giving their educational seat to foreigners. Why would a country not educate their own people? Why would a country allow global businesses to displace their citizens and their sovereignty? Why would any country allow its businesses to fire their countrymen and employ foreigners? Why is the USA government allowing multinational corporations to displace their authority and compromise their sovereignty and the well being of their people? How can the president of the USA take jobs away from his own people and compromise the stability of his own country? Please support the USA and the STEM education and employment of USA citizens.
