I highly support this proposal for the following reasons:

1. The international students got their undergraduate or graduate degrees in US, and learned the knowledge here. After graduation, they should have the opportunity to apply what they have learned to make contributions to the US, but not leaving upon graduation.

2. Competition is very important motivation for the progress of a society. With competition, people may work as normal, but not thinking of new ideas or new technologies to make the society moving forward. If the people in the society feel satisfied and don't want to make it improved, I don't think this society could last long.

3. There are many talents from the world, and now living in US. They have made a lot of contributions to US, and the world. US is a good place to live and work, it attracts the people as well. Without this proposal, many of the international students have to leave US after graduation, US may lost a huge amount of talents in the future. This is not a good sign to all the other people who were planning to US.

People would think about this: why should I go to US, then go home as soon as graduation? Then, more and more people would say US is not a good place to go to anymore. I don't think this thought is good for the society, the US and the world.
