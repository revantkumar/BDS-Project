Jie Wang In my mind, USA is always welcoming talents from worldwide in order to build a better world. F1 students with STEM Degrees are most from Engineering field, who are significantly contributing to the advancement of technology and industry. To compete with local students, F1 students have to overcome more obstacles than others. I believe it is a very fair request to improve and expand training opportunities for F1 students with STEM degrees and have Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students.
