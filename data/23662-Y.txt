I strongly support this program proposed by DHS. Some people argue that this regulation allows foreigners take over their jobs, but they never think about why. In my view, the U.S. is still leading the world because it is an immigrant country which allows top engineers and researchers to stay and work for it. Without these people, I don't think the U.S. will keep its leading place in the future. We need to improve ourselves to compete with others, and this is the rule to survive in this human world. The reason why this proposal is only for STEM students is that these fields often bring in new economic growth in the country, which as a result leads to more new job positions.
