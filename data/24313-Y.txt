American economy depends on high technique companies, expanding the OPT can be a good approach to have more nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. They are willing to do these hard jobs, meanwhile, their existences do not affect citizens' rates of employment apparently.I am totally agree to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students.
