I fully support this proposal. Everyone knows that the foreign students who are using their OPT or extension and now working in some big companies, i.e. FB, Amazon, Google, occupy a huge percentage among all the employees. FB, Amazon and Google could not reach that high achievement without those F1 students. To maintain or go further than current achievement, it's impossible to remove all the foreign students. The extension of OPT let F1 students stay longer, make more contribution and let the Americans have a easier and happier life. The work positions that F1 students occupying now are impossible to be taken by Americans. What I'm saying is that most of the F1 students are on the top of the pyramid in their original country and with great talent that can not be replaced by Americans. There are some work that can not be done Americans. We need F1 students and to make a more wonderful word. This is the thing that really matters.
