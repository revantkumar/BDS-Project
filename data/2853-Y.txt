I strongly support the proposal to extend F-1 student optional practical training (OPT) time to 24 months.

This would benefit the students by creating the opportunity to work together with companies towards innovation and thus towards the progress of America's economy.

This also means that students can work in long-term with the start-up companies or create one which can boost the economy and as well as decrease the unemployment percentage in America by creating jobs for the fellow Americans.

This will also create revenue to America by increasing the amount of students coming in with F-1 visa for higher studies as they are given the opportunity to implement their ideas or gain some level of industrial exposure after their graduation.

So, I strongly suggest that the OPT-extension for the STEM students should be implemented.
