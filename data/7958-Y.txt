I am against this proposed regulation of foreign students having this opportunity before our young citizen students have that chance of applying and being employed by tech companies and other companies. Companies in U.S. should not get a tax exemption for hiring these foreign students before American students. That is unpatriotic and unfair. It should not be an executive order, our congressional system should be making laws. Our immigration laws are broken, need reforming to suit this countrhy and not the world. We help the world now , let's begin helping ourselves. This administration is out of control and power hungry -greedy. 
Thank you and hope this might help Joan DavisJ
