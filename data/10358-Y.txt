Yuntian Wang, Faurecia I strongly hope this code will be passed because it provides much more chances for large technical companies to gain more valuable employees. On the other hand, the H1-B lottery should be fair that every single person can only submit their application once, but not depending on how many companies can file the application. A lot of Indian students are paying many companies to help them file H1-B applications. Thus, they have more chances to get H1-B visa instead of following the real lottery system. This is extremely unfair to other students since they are disturbing the system.
