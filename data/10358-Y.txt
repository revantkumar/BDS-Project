This proposed rule will increase the employment opportunities for US citizens. The main reason for companies employment international students with OPT is that they cannot find US citizens to fill the positions. Those positions will then create more employment opportunities for US citizens. If international students have to leave the country because of work authorization issues, US companies will SUFFER significant profit/competitiveness loss, which decrease the employment opportunities for US citizens.
