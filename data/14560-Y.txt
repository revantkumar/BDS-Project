As an stem student, I strongly the proposal for the following reasons:
1) This would help me a lot to gain some working experience after my graduation. I'm Chinese and all my family is in China. I'm not intended to remain here and gain the social benefit here(clearly this is the main reason why american oppose this regulation). I can live with my family in China and I can live very well in China. All I want is to get some working experience here and then when I returned to my country, I can find a better job. This opt is very important to me, because without OPT, I can hardly work here and with a diploma of United states, it's more difficult to complete with other students who have studied in China. Besides this, this is one promise that the US government has given to our internationals students. How can you change the words when I'm going to find the job next year!!!!!! 
2) This is kind of help to the US technology companies. From what I learnt in University, a project in a company will normally last more than one year. It's really ridiculous to change so many people in a same project. When you've trained well a person , he has worked for some months and he has to leave ,the company has to find another person and spend some time to train him again. This's really waste money and time.
