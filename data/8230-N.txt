Why is it so important to bring F-1 students and non-immigrants to work in the US? Why? I and many others spend tens of thousands of dollars on our education hoping for better future. I go to school full-time and work part-time to pay for my expenses. I have no time for anything, I am constantly tired due to the sleep deprivation. But I thought I knew why I am doing it. However,our county prefers to bring someone who did not pay for education here, kids of wealthy foreign parents ( to face the truth, these are the only ones who always get in) and take jobs away from us. And it is all because companies that employ them will not have to pay full wages, employers' part of retirement,and many other things.Just to allow big business to keep more money in their pockets,our government is ready to rob its own citizens of jobs we could have. I do not feel it is fair toward me,toward my fellow students-friends who are graduating and toward those who are already looking for jobs.
