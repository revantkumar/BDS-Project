Obviously longer OPT extension time will benefit both the entire US society and those foreign students for at least these following reasons:
1. STEM students would have more time to understand their career path in US. Given the health of US economy, more of them would love to stay to contribute to US society.
2. These students will have bigger opportunity to get H1b visa.
2. Meanwhile, with longer OPT time, students that would like to leave won't bother to apply H1b visa; these positions will be left for these who are willing to stay and contribute.
