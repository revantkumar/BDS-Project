I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE EXTENDING OF OPT. It is America's science and technology that support its entire economy. Advance in science and technology will bring more job opportunities to other fields of the market.Extending the OPT will definitely attract more talented students from world wide and boost the development of the field of STEM, therefore facilitate the prosperity of the US economy. And this condition will ultimately benefit all American citizens so it is a great plan for both foreigners and domestic residents.
