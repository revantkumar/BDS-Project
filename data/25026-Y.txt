I want to emphasize that to address the shortage of scientists and engineers, we must do both reform our education system and our immigration policies. If we dont, American companies simply will not have the talent they need to inno- vate and compete.(Bill Gates, Testimony at the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Science and Technology on March 12, 2008)

As an engineer graduate from Dartmouth College, I really support the idea above from Bill Gates!!
