I support the 24 month extension. 

First of all, the merit of people is not where he come from, what immigration status he has, but the true knowledge he obtains and what contribution he could make to U.S. 

I believe in american higher education thus I believe those international students who earned their degree would make good contribution to our country. It would be better if they could stay longer in USA. Job market is an open market and should welcome full competition. I'd like to see that for a healthy, profitable and ever-growing industry rather than unhealthy companies in order to secure employment opportunities for local people. Anyways, it's 17 to 24 months extension, we are not inviting people to stay forever. 

I also see great stimulus of economic growth brought by international students and working professionals, especially from Chinese, who tend to buy things. They even start small business of international trading. This is also good for USA. 

International students are not invaders, they are just normal people like every US citizen who learn, who work, who live their lives. We should look at the bright side of them. I believe it's better for american industry and economy if they could stay longer.
