Thomas Churchill This new rule will bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. STEM-related disciplines are responsible for many of the societal innovations that make our world better. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM. Hiring international students does not mean stealing jobs from Americans. I personally did not see ANY American students with STEM degrees and decent GPAs get unemployed.
