I support the approval of this proposal. Why do we want to lose hard working immigrants to our rival countries if they can be more qualified and better fit for jobs that our own people might not even want to do? 

I have friends (citizens) who are from STEM and doing Product Manager roles at Amazon. They know how to code or program but they don't want to be exhausted Software Engineers who stare at the screen all day without too much communication and interaction with other teams. They're local, speak better English and know more culture, so they have better options, i.e. PM, instead of having to work as SE.

If immigrants are smart and diligent enough to do the work, why do we want them to go serve other countries and help contribute our rivals-to-be?

I strongly support this proposal.
