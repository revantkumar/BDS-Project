I only want to provide one reason for supporting the OPT extension. Several weeks ago, Russian President Putin was interviewed in the '60 Minutes' show. When he was asked what identity of the US is the one that he respects most, he answered, and I totally agreed on his words, that it is the ability that the US can do such a great job with such a diverse population. It is the talented all over the world that makes this country great and unique. OPT is one of the most important tools to attract talented people, make them stay in this country and make this country continuously powerful.
