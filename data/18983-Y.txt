The STEM OPT extension is obviously a benefit to United State economy and technology. It will keep US as the most technologically advanced and culturally diverse country in the world for the following reasons.

Firstly, STEM OPT extension is targeting STEM students who are the most talented and hardworking students in their university. These students can provide US great human resources. Employing people who have high education background, US companies can keep growing their revenue and expanding their market. Therefore this is good for both STEM students and the US companies to have STEM OPT extension.

Secondly, some people comment about that STEM students will take US residents jobs away. However, it wont. Because the demanding of engineering and science jobs position is high, there is no worries that STEM students will take away the job position of US residents. Also, this extension is only specific for STEM students, so it doesnt make any sense that workers or other people from non-engineering positions will lose their jobs.

Finally, US has a culture of immigration and this is a great value of United States. Therefore, US should give more chances to foreigners to work and stay in United States.
