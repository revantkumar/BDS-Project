Dear Sir or Madam, 

I am an international student currently studying at Cornell University. I am writing to offer my compliment and appreciation toward this newly revised extension. Not only I think it is great for the booming technology industries in the States, but also it could significantly impact the life of millions of students like myself. Thank you very much for considering this proposal. 

Best, 
Yu Chen
