I support this proposal. It's not just a matter of justice, but more importantly good competition mechanisms. I mean, let's face it, how many percentages of students in STEM areas are international students? A vast majority! The OPT extension is a natural way to select the best among them to work in US; with no extension, most international students have to leave US regardless of their work capacity. More chances create the good.
