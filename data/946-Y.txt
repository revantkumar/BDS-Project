SAY YES TO OPT EXTENSION!

USA need STEM students. American high technology companies attract millions of talents all over the world and all these talents will absolutely increase the development of companies and therefore will promote American economics. All these companies will help USA to sustain the apex science and technology in the world. Talents from other countries bring new ideas and logic thinking which will create an edge-cutting team.

OPT EXTENSION will not affect the employment rate. Even though students from STEM will increase the level of the fierce competition, this will only affect the high level technology job positions. However, actually in this area demandalways exceeds supply, which means foreign employees will only help USA but not affect the USA negatively.
