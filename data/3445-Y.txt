I think the problem is not OPT, the real problem is H1-B, which definitely needs reform.
If the cap of H1-B is unchanged, and it is still being used this way, are we going to get 36 or 48 months OPT?

H-1B needs to be reformed to either reflect the real needs or avoid systematic abuses caused by many Consulting Companies. This kind of abusing also hurts the interest of American workers.

Maybe one can setup a special visa system for computer software workers/engineers only?
