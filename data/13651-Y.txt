I really want this to be approved.

Personally I graduated from CMU as a master, and am working in a software company. And I really appreciate this chance.

It is really helpful and I learnt a lot from this training opportunity at the company. What you learn from the book is totally different from what you can learn from a tech job here. I think they are both learning sources. 
This part is important to us.
