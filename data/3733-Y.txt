This is a super great proposal. I support it for the following reasons:
1. International students who have studied in US enhanced America multiple culture communication. I am so impressed by their power in making US such a nice place to come. The spirit of freedom has impacted a lot of students to be as creative as they can. This new regulation provides a longer time for students to work in US. Because students do not need to worry about their working identity that much, they will focus more on contributing to this country instead of spending time worrying about their status. 
2. This regulation will not actually create any negative impact, since the students it supports are technical students who will later work for US technology companies. These companies are well known of lacking high tech employees. And therefore this regulation will help those big companies as well as promising start ups to grow healthily. As a result, it will help America's economy. And I do believe, this huge group of students will help keeping America's economy to grow steady, especially in this economic bubble time, when everything is fragile and needs really good and strong support.
3. Many of the best people who helped America to grow are once students. If there weren't such great regulation, America will lose this group of people. And as consequence, America will lose these opportunities to keep those who are really talented. I think this is once America's super power and I do not expect this great country to become mediocre.
