I support the extension of the OPT. Some people disagree with the extension because they think the foreign students take away the job opportunities for American citizens. I would say it is not the case according to personal observation. I think it is a complementary. Foreign students can fill in the gap between the available high tech workers and the need of employers. I think the reality has explained this: If the high-tech companies can hire enough American citizens to work for them, why would they bother hiring foreign students for whom the employers need to make additional investment? I think it is because the employers cannot find enough American citizens to work for them. Foreign students can obviously fill in the gap.
