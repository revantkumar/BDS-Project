F-1 Students should definitely have more training opportunities after their graduation. We all know that college is where you learn but they can't provide any in field professional experiences at all. International students should be treated equally because instead of taking the U.S citizens' jobs, they are actually creating more values and chances for the U.S. Market with their academic and professional skills. United States is the country of freedom so international students should also have their freedom to receive professional training after their graduation.
