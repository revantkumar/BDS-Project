Please provide a response to the following:

The regulation provide for on site inspections to protect the imported foreign student, but not the U.S. worker. DHS should/must conduct on-site reviews to ensure that employers meet BOTH the educational requirements and to provide documents and interviews with employees to ensure that no U.S.workers is in any way adversely impacted. Such documentation and interviews must extend to all employees both present and for the PAST FIVE (5) YEARS WITH NAMES, ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBERS.

The Regulations fail to impose notice of any penalties for violation of the Regulations or student fraud. This visa program is the most fraud riddled of all the visa programs that, according to the numerous FBI reports and public warnings, allows foreign students to spy on U.S. government agencies and employers. The FBI has publicly stated that there are so many foreign student spies that the FBI does not have enough field agents to keep track of them.

Finally, the Regulations fail to impose any penalty for the employers violation of the Regulations. Thus, the employer may violate any provision of the Regulation, and thus the Statute, without any penalty. No punishment for fraud leaves the victimized American still goes without proper compensation.
