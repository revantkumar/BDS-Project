This is just not new regulation by the DHS its new law that DHS wrote all on their own. Congress makes laws not Federal 
agencies or their employees. This new law along with the current law is undermining our own student citizens from 
employment throwing more Americans into the unemployed who then have to depend on government handouts. Even though
these are foreign college graduates, DHS designates them as foreign students. Foreign students don't pay payroll taxes. And
neither does the employer. The employer is exempt from paying the 6.2% Social Security and 1.45% Medicare taxes.That nearly
8 percent difference means an employer can save money by hiring a foreigner over an American.

Microsoft came up with a scam to use student visas to get around the H-1B quotas. Microsoft's plan was to increase the 
duration of OPT to 29 months so that OPT could serve as a substitute for H-1B visas. Microsoft presented its plan to DHS 
Secretary Chertoff at a dinner. From there, DHS worked in secrecy with industry lobbyists to craft regulations.The public 
received no notice that such regulations we being considered until DHS put them in place without notice and comment.
In August, the D.C. District Court held that the public had been unlawfully denied notice and comment and vacated the 
regulations effective February 12, 2016, giving DHS an opportunity to put things right before all the foreign "student" guest 
workers would have to go home. Rather than wind down the misguided OPT program, DHS responded by doubling down with 
new regulations expanding OPT to 36 months.

The regulation/new law is so deeply anti American that it is discrimination against our own student/ worker citizens from our own 
government. This needs to be thrown in the trash and DHS Secretary Chertoff need to be arrested for conducting this in secret.
