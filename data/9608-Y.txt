I strongly support this opt extension. I really think this extension will benefit both the students and companies. As we know the H1-B visa application is very competitive each year, forcing many excellent foreign employees leave their companies. This is a loss for those firms and also a pity for the brilliants. Students coming from all around the world to USA because best opportunities are offered here and they will get armed by the experience. But one thing should be taken into consideration is that they all take a large risk to do so, coming to a new country and making their livings alone. So it is important to protect their hope and will, or they may be scared back by the tough and unfriendly working environment. 

I believe that one country depends on the people who live in there. I see many people of my country just stay here after they study and work for some time. This is a sign of a strong country that she can attract the best ones. They choose to stay because first they have the opportunity to stay, then things go to work or life. If the government offers more opportunities for people to stay and let them sifted by the competition of work, which is supposed to be a natural way the society behaves, the whole nation will certainly be benefited. Now the world is getting smaller and smaller, and so is the difference among countries. I trust that the greatest country in the future is the one that can gather the best people.
