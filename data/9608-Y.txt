Ken McQueen I SUPPORT to this Proposal. This would offer the students in STEM areas who learned knowledge from U.S. universities more chances to provide their knowledge and help making more contributions to the economy of our country. It would be always a stupid idea to FORCE them go back using what they have learnt in U.S to help their own country to compete with U.S in STEM area.
Some one may argue that this proposal would make it harder for U.S citizens in STEM areas to find
jobs.But when we take a deep look towards this issue, we would find the U.S companies,concretely , have more choices. They can simply outsource those jobs to India, Russia,Korea and China.This would be a even worse scenario, in which United States are losing more jobs and much more taxes.We might have to face "made in China, Designed in India".I believe that each fellow American don't wish this to happen.
