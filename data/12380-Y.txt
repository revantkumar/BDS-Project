I strongly support the ideal for improving and expanding OPT for F-1 non-immigrant STEM students. 

American innovation is key to the country's success, and high-skilled non-immigrant students with higher degree are too valuable to drive out . The fear that STEM students will take away job positions is a false statement. The truth is they fill in job positions which might not even exist if they weren't in the job markets in the first place. In the short term, the talent pool might experiences more competition, but in the long run, the whole industry prospers and the better economic environment in turn creates more job opportunities.

American people are wise enough not to harm the country's long term interest and I encourage everyone to support the proposed rule!
