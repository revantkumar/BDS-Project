I just think that this is a very good step of adding 2 years to the OTP because of two reasons.
1. The students themselves get adequate time to learn from the organizations and implement their knowledge gained in college.
2. The organization also gets to benefit from the additional period, as the current OTP is spent on training the newly recruited students.
