I'm not a STEM major, but i strongly support the OPT STEM extension. Most of my friends who are STEM major came to the U.S. for undergrad with financial support/scholarship from the University. Many of them continue to grad school, and excel in their research or internships. They are intelligent, hard-working, and dedicated to their career. And after the U.S. universities have invested so much in their education, it's a joke that the U.S. government forces these talented young people to find jobs in other countries because they can not legally work in the States (while so many illegal immigrants are able to work legally). 

Most people who object the OPT believe us foreign students are stealing jobs from the Americans. But this is not true. Think about the cost for an organization to hire an international student versus an American student -- the cost of hiring a lawyer and filing for job visa can easily cost a company more than $6,000. So it's actually cheaper to hire a U.S. citizen. When companies decide to hire an international student, it's always because he/she is better qualified for the job, and the company sees more value in investing in him/her. As the government, you shouldn't listen to the complaints from people who can't find a job (they can't blame others for being more competent), instead, listen to what companies are saying. Think about what is best for your economy. When every nation in the world is fighting to keep talents and striving to seek global talents, the U.S. is the only country that does the opposite. Well done, well done. The other countries should really thank the U.S. for delivering top talents to them.
