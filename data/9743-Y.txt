Kevin Scott I believe diversity is one important factor that push the U.S to be the most competitive. We have to admit that in some areas, the foreigners have lead the innovations and improvements, which is really good for the U.S economy and science. So we benefit from the competition and the diversity. On the other hand, many Americans think the foreigners has take up too many positions by asking for low salary, that is not true from my sight, the OPT requires the students to do jobs relevant to their majors, so most of them are competing to get really good positions about science, engineering and so on, these positions are not low paid, on the contrary, these are really competitive positions usually paying more and playing important roles in developing new technologies. The competition is equal, and we should give more welcome to foreign competitors so as to make more innovations and improvements for our lives.
