I admit that some of the jobs are taken from the foreign students, but they also created so many innovative tools and services that changed our daily life. Isn't America successful because we attract elites from all over the world? What happens if we force them to leave this country and serve their own country and compete with us? They probably will take some jobs temporarily, but they will create more later. We just cannot simply think that the number of jobs is fixed and will never change.
