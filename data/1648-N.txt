Im currently working in the computer engineering field at IBM and feel the direct consequence of foreign students and graduated workers competing for jobs that I, a 6 generation American born Texan, should be paid more to do. While I was recenlty working also at Intel Corp in Austin, TX, at least 70% of the workers there are either Middle Easter or Indian or Asian persons. Who exactly knows their citizen status...Im sure its not important to the board members who are replacing the still employable experienced American engineer with cheaper off shore labor. Disgusting. Three times a week we have a conference call to India to give the team members the 'work' todo....you can hear the chickens, dogs and automobile traffic in the background as these underpaid, offshore employees collaborate with their American team well into the evening hour. Of course they will work late and for much cheaper if there cost of living is a penitence of what it is in the US. 

I believe we should impose a heavy tax on goods imported from other counties, wether those goods are manufactured by American companies operating overseas or domestic organizations. Level the playing field for all involved and stop cheating the American worker...
