To the Americans who oppose OPT: in your argument, what is the so-called advantage of the international student over the Americans? That "International students are forced to work for a lower wage"? You call this an advantage? Like you can't work for a wage that an international person is making?
I thought this is a free country. People should have a choice to work for a lower wage if that is the only way to achieve their goal. International people can work here for a lower wage, or work at Canada or Australia, or go back and work in their country. If they are working here for a lower wage, they have chosen this path because they want to stay here. Nobody is forced. They always have the choice to go back home.
These Americans would still oppose OPT STEM if companies are hiring international people at the same wages. Because they think the only reason that they can't find a job is because of the diligent, hard-working foreign workers.
