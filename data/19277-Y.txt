I support the proposal. To help foreign students get work visa or green card, companies need to cover lots of additional expenses and eventually they can spend more on foreign students than native students. I don't see any reason to oppose this proposal as companies are actually willing to spend more on keeping foreign students who are the ones benefiting from the proposed extension.
