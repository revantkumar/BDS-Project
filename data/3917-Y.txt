I strongly support the OPT extension that helps international students to find a job in United States. 
United States is in its nature an immigrant country. In its 300 years of history, United States has embraced thousands of millions of immigrants coming to its shores from all over the world. Nowadays, a lot of countries are trying to attract more international students, including Canada, UK, China and so on. The reason is very obvious, on one side they want to let more people know their country to increase their impact on the world, and also they want to make money from these international students! Why more and more people choose the United States for STEM degree? That is because they can find a stem related job after they graduate, if the stem opt extension ended, there is no doubt that most of international students will lost their interest to go to the US..
