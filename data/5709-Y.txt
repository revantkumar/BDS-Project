Gene Gipson The Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule to expand the Optional Practical Training program amounts to corporate welfare. The proposed rule would extend the amount of time a foreign student can work in the United States from one year to three years. It artificially expands the pool of available workers, allowing employers to depress wages and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes by hiring foreign workers instead of American workers. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.

While the largest majority of U.S. companies in violation of U.S. immigration laws are primarily the high tech companies, there are many smaller companies doing the same thing--using loose requirements to get around hiring Americans. For example, hiring foreigners to do accounting and clerical work, as well as other smaller requirements jobs that in the past were filled with younger Americans that did part time work. It has become so blatantly obvious for anyone to see that it is now an in-your-face issue which will eventually create a violent reaction by those being effected.

Have government personnel become so insensitive, that they can't even relate to what the younger people are going through. I have seen many Americans that had good paying jobs in carpentry and other construction jobs lose their jobs while these contractors hire foreigners' to replace them. There isn't any savings to buyers purchasing these houses--the saved costs are pocketed by the contractors. This is happening everywhere you go, so there is no excuse for the government to continue allowing this to happen.
