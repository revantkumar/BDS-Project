I completely support the proposed OPT extension and I think it should be extended to other fields as well. I will share my story. I am an international student in Aerospace sector and I did my post graduation at MIT, and it is impossible for an international to work with leading Aerospace firms. So I completely DISAGREE that we are taking away American jobs. Once I had to get out from the middle of an interview at Boeing after they realized that I am an international even though I had all the required qualification. But I wanted to work in core Aerospace sector, so I went to Europe and worked for Boeing's rival - Airbus. 

Here are my two cents for why the OPT extension is justified:
1. At least in my vast network of American friends who are well-educated and qualified, I don't know even a single person who has to sit at home. The bottom line is if you have the requisite skills, then both Americans and internationals have same opportunities.
2. America is a land of immigrants. It just doesn't make sense for America to train young smart kids and then loose them to another country, and then hire some less qualified American.
3. History is full of examples that so many US companies were started by non-Americans employing lots of Americans. What if they were not given the visas?
4. I feel that lot of frustration among Americans against OPT is because of mis-information or news items like "How Indian workers replaced 250 workers at Disney". I have to agree, that if any company is trying to hire cheaper contract workers to cut down on costs by laying off Americans, then that is totally unethical and any relevant and any relevant legal action should be considered against such malpractices. But cases like this have little to do with OPT period allowed for eligible and deserving STEM graduates.
