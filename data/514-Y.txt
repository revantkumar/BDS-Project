The Optional Practical Training (OPT) program is a great opportunity for both the internationals and United States. The exceptional US education system attracts international students not only in the way that it provides world leading education, also because it's excellent post-graduate program - which OPT is one of them. With the OPT program, international students would have a chance to get training from real industry or academia institutes and apply what is learnt to the actual work. It is the best chance for us to change the role from STEM students to real scientists and engineers, in order to better serve this country, and rest of the world. That is to say, the OPT program is one of the most important part for the US academic sector's global impact.

As one of the international students who is benefit from this program, I am fully aware of the situation that when my employer hired me, not only they have to go through a way more complex process than any normal US citizen, but also they have to sign the agreement that they hire international students in OPT without excluding any qualified US candidates or terminate, layoff any existing US employees. 

Moreover, most long term research projects, which will produce robust result has a three year cycle. Three years is also an important stage for any tech startup. Those are areas which usually have a higher percentage STEM opt students. Extending the OPT to 24 months help those small companies and research groups grow sturdily, which will further be able to contribute to US economy and create more job opportunities.
