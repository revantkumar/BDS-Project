When we search the database of how many work visas are sponsored each year, we will find that 95 PERCENT of VISA SPONSORSHIPS ARE GIVEN TO INDIANS WHO ARE BROUGHT TO UNITED STATES BY THOSE IT CONSULTING COMPANIES. THEY ARE THE GROUP WHO TAKES US CITIZENS JOBS, NOT INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS.

While those international students who pay expensive education tuitions and spend millions of money in America, they are not the lucky birds who can easily get jobs after graduation because tons of technical jobs are taken by Indians from IT consulting companies. Those companies bring people from India and sell them with low salaries to technical companies in US and sponsor work visa. They are taking away Americans jobs.

So if we support OPT Stem, we can help solve this issue. We can help more and more Americans get jobs.
