I strongly agree with the proposal as both American people and F-1nonimmigrant students can benefit from it. The reasons for why I support it include:

First of all, our government grants F-1 students the opportunities to learn knowledge from U.S. universities. What they have learned is what the U.S. needs. If they get more work opportunities in the U.S., they can definitely make lots of contribution to the U.S.

Second, diversity is really important for the U.S. Remember that everyone of American people used to be an immigrant. U.S. becomes a great country because it welcomes smart and hard-working people who pursue their own American dream.

Third, more competition could improve the efficiency in most of the industries. 

To conclude, I firmly support such a necessary proposal.
