Dear all members of DHS,

I strongly support this new OPT extension rule. 

Since we are here is for getting more knowledge in specific field, we still need an opportunity to practice. That is also a reason for the existence of OPT. Thus, the international students deserve an chance to work for United States and make some contributions for technical field. As a student in this field (STEM), we need a lot practical experience. However, if this extension gets canceled, the knowledge we grasped would lost. Basically, it is meaningless to pursue higher education in United States. If we have such a situation, the United States will lose the influence of education accordingly. 

Because of this legal issue, it is possible someone has been in OPT extension period already. If this bill becomes invalid, those people would lose their jobs immediately. The unemployment rate which is the most significant issue that the U.S. government cares about will increase undoubtedly. The U.S. government may receive a lot lawsuit cases as well.

Lots of immigrants achieved succeed in United States, like Sundar Pichai, a CEO for Google. Apparently, Google, Inc raised the U.S GDP and created a lots of job opportunities for local people in wherever the google branch located. Meanwhile, the Google also bring significant influence for U.S. government and this country. If you intend to image the world without Google, the Top position of Tech may lose. 

Thus, it is meaningful and important to keep OPT extension.
