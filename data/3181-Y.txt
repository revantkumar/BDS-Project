M. K. Jones After paying mightily for college my children are unemployed in STEM. All these programs are just a way for Zuckerberg and Gates to hire out of country workers and pay them less than Americans. 

Just tax these companies an amount equal to the salaries of HB1 people and you will see they suddenly ARE able to find Americans who can do the work. 

No extensions for foreign students. In fact, you should have a program to reduce the amount of foreign students. What do we get out of it, teach them computers so they can go home and use that tech in ISIS or hack us from China?
