As to the comment that America & Americans first, I want to say something below:

1. Technology companies have the right to choose employee they want. So with extension, the technology companies will get more chance to hire an outstanding people, which is good to the improvement of U.S. technology.

2. Extension will attract more talent people around the world to come to U.S. and make contributions to U.S.

3. Students educated here deserve to have the chance to work here longer to gain experience.
