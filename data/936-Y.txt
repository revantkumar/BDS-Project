I support the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. The OPT Extension is very critical for international students with STEM degree. The STEM international students are important groups for the economic development and technology innovation in U.S., and they contribute a great amount of knowledge and high-quality labors to the society. This group of graduate students will eventually create more job opportunities and benefit more people, including U.S. citizens in finding work in the technology field.
