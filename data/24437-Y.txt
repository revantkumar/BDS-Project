I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. The economy of America has and will always benefit from having talented foreign people to work in STEM area that they've been trained for many years.
2. The higher education in US will also benefit from this rule since a relatively longer OPT extension will attract more talented foreign students from all over the world to study in US.
3. Offering foreign students equal opportunity is a reflection of American spirit.
