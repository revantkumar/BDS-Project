I strongly agree with "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students" proposed rule.

Firstly, the increase participants in the job market will only benefit the country economy overall because the employers have a better chance of finding a suited employee that does his/her job the best and the competition between job seekers strengthens their skills, naturally eliminating unqualified ones.

Secondly, there is no denying that globalization is the unstoppable trend. Having employers native to different parts of the world is one of the best methods of welcoming this trend. 

Thirdly, diversity is one strong demonstration of equal human rights, a long praised American character that the country holds dear of. This proposed rule no doubt supports this character in a positive way. Attempts to block out international students who have no less potential shake the foundation that America is built on.
