I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:
1. The government should welcome international students to keep making contributions to the US instead of driving them back
2. Competition is not a bad thing. The government should allow such synergetic competition to exist, and to improve competitiveness of the new generation, regardless of being domestic or international
3. Diversity is vital.
