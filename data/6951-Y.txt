I think STEM Extension is a good rule. US economy can benefit from such policy.

Without such rule, foreign students in STEM field may be forced to leave the country in 1 year. In this situation, employers will be very reluctant to hire foreign students graduating from STEM field, who are contributing a lot currently to the US economic development.
