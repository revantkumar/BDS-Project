I strongly support this proposal. US now is receiving at rate of more than $200000.00 per student for 2 year degree with tuition and graduation fees, staying expenses and other education revenue.Without OPT extension international students will go other country like Canada or Austrilia. US will lose more than $80000000000.00.
