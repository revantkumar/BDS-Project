Zinan Xiong If this extension is not passed, more and more international STEM student will not stay in United States and they will go home immediately after graduate, and you guys know what will happen if all of them just go back home and don't find a job here, and you know what the technology and science and engineering of the whole United States will be!

Think twice and I do support this proposal!
