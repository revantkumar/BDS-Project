Stop this travesty of justice against American workers. We need jobs and the oath you swore when accepting your positions was to serve and protect the interests of the citizens of the United States. We have enough trash in this country already with your lax immigration policies and it is time to TAKE OUT THE TRASH. Stop this travesty.
