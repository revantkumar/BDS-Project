I totally agree with the proposal.

The students with STEM degrees are high quality professional. Their work will contribute to the economic growth, especially in high-tech industry. Meanwhile, they earn their own livings and abide the laws. They are practicing the American Values! Since the government could accept illegal immigrants, why they does not welcome these high quality professional immigrants? Also, if we push these valuable human resources back to their own nation, like China, it will accelerate the rise of China and other countries, which may not be in line with American interests.
