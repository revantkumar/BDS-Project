The STEM graduates are young educated professionals. They should be given more opportunities in US to gain work experience after their graduation. The additional 24-month OPT time will provide them with broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally development and career exploring as well as network creating. These benefits will also encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and eventually allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.

I urge the US government to support the U.S. economy by allowing the 24-month additional OPT time for STEM graduates.
