I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. 

Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. 

College graduates are struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
