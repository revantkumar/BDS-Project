Saheed Adepoju I believe this new rule is a very strong and effective move to help strengthen the knowledge economy of the US. As a current international student in a STEM degree, it would help provide a pathway to help build more ideas and businesses. The US is full of opportunities and it is not only for people looking to get a job but for people looking to build strong ties in the US from a business point of view. Having a 36months stay will give the opportunities to generate more business ideas and generate jobs for the economy. I fully support this plan and hope it would be adopted.
