I personally support the new STEM OPT extension. 

12 month OPT plus 24 month extension would be perfect for completing a meaningful project. I'm a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering. I'm currently in the 3rd year of a NSF funded 3-year project related to packaging modeling. Most of the work I did in the 1st year of involvement was to do literature review and prep myself to be able to do some real work in the next two years. And actually the 3rd year is the most fruitful year. Without OPT extension, one won't be able to get fully involved in a project and do any meaningful work. And it would be a waste of time and money if people are only allowed one year in multiple-year projects.

U.S. is a country that welcomes immigrants and foreigners. They come to contribute their knowledge and efforts to the economic prosperity of the U.S.. Without OPT extension, the F-1 students won't be able to apply what they've learned in school to the industry and they may turn their eyes to other nations instead. U.S. may lose some strengths in attracting foreign students to come to the U.S. which would have a negative impact on the competitiveness of the educational system and the economy of the U.S..
