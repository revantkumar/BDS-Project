I strongly support extending the STEM OPT.

These majors produce a lot of high-skilled employees for companies that make lots of revenue. The top IT companies such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tweeter, Amazon, Apple, General Motor and so on. Make products that's associated with people's everyday life, creating new techniques that are critical for economics, military and security.

Imagine there's no STEM OPT extension anymore, and millions of students cannot work for the top companies anymore: 1) The company will be severely impacted 2) Economic will be affected 3) To fill the gap of high-skilled tech-people? America needs more than 22 years of education to produce a new generation, which we have right now, and don't have to make them leave.
