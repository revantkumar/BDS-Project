I'm in favor of the proposed rule, which would, if approved, help attract a lot of talented and knowledgeable people to America. Reading through a few comments listed here, it seems people who are against this proposal are mostly worried about the possible decrease of wages for tech workers, because it is "expanding the pool of available workers" in the STEM fields. However, it doesn't seem there are enough STEM workers here. Companies hire or not hire a worker based not only on the wage, but more on the worker's capability. It's an illusion that companies will hire more domestic STEM people if foreign ones are blocked out of the States, but instead, the enterprising companies will go overseas to find what some people here call "cheap labors", which does even more harm to the United States. I do support the U.S. taking every effort to improve the quality of domestic higher education, thus making the domestic students more competitive, but simply screening other capable people out of the window will not protect the domestic students beyond the first one year or two from now.
