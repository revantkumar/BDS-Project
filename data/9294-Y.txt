I totally support this STEM OPT extension policy.
Because there are a lot of companies, especially tech companies that need higher degree graduates for the position in them. And for the international students who obtained their STEM degree, it is a necessary for them to lot for a job within this period of time. At the same time, this policy can make sure America can keep the most brilliant people within US.
Besides, if there is no this policy, the universities, and companies may not be that attractive to the smart people from all over the world. Also it will make the H1-B working visa worse
