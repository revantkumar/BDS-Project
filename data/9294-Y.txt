Sherry Hu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. With knowledge learnt in U.S, international students can make great contribute to the U.S government

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, USA is a country which has multiple cultures and a lot of great people were international people before.

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing.And also international students's job doesn't conflict with local people. The number of STEM major of American people is not very large, but the demands of STEM major is very large. Furthermore, competition will make a country better.
