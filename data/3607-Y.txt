I think the regulation will be beneficial to the tech firms in a sense that most projects last for 2-3 years. The 24-month extension will save those firms millions of time, money and other risks on hiring and training new people in the middle of the projects. Also, a three-year work experience is meaningful for any international students since it's more convincing and solid for them to find a good position when they come back to their home countries. Overall, many of them pay high for their STEM education here in the US because of the patential OPT experiences. Otherwise STEM talents would rather contribute to other countries' GDP by paying a much lower price for education but gain longer potential experiences.
