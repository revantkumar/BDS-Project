I strongly support this rule because it is the best rule ever to improve US economy. Back to 2008, the economy was the lowest for 20 years, however, the STEM OPT rule changed the situation. Nowadays, US's unemployment rate is the highest in history compared with 2008, it changed significantly. This is a great achievement for STEM OPT, it improved US economy and solved unemployment problem.

Lots of people against this rule never think about the benefit form this rule, this rule is creating millions of job opportunities instead of taking them. With more and more STEM students on OPT, the technology companies keep expending which makes more and more US workers to get a great job.

Back to school, we can never see enough US STEM students but international students. In this case, US NEEDS STEM OPT to attract more STEM students to study here, and work here to build a better US. Without STEM OPT, how does those IT companies to fill the position to build most advanced product? How does thousands of startups around US to become world's leading companies? 

STEM OPT must be longer to help US Universities and technology companies to be world best!
