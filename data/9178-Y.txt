I totally support this proposal for the following reason.

First of all, international students who have chance to come to study at US, especially master/PhD students, are very highly selected. Not only they are selected from their own countries, but also be selected by US universities in a very competitive large pool. Because of such nature, they have presented a high level of academic performance on average. I'm a student from Georgia Institute of Technology, in the research lab I am working in and others, not only there are many more international students in engineering area, but also they are working earnestly and have made a lot of progresses. And in the industries, international students have also showed their great efforts, especially those technology companies who need all kinds of engineers.

Apparently, not all the people want to obtain master/phd degrees, but those master/Phd students have very good academic background and good research skills that companies urgently need. And US needs those skilled people to maintain its technological and economic advantages.
