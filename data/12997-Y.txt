This regulation is very wise and excellent. Improving and expanding the Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant students with STEM degrees will definitely attract more overseas students to study STEM degree and accelerate the economics of United States.

A lot of students are currently working for the companies in the U.S with their OPT. If the OPT cannot be expanded and they could not get their lottery for H1B visa, they have no choice but to leave, which would undoubtedly be a huge impact for the companies. This will negatively impact American's economy. 

I fully agree with this regulation and I think it is a wise and brilliant decision. It should be put into effect as soon as possible.
