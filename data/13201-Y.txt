I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. With a maximum three-year OPT period, STEM students are able to involve in the full life cycle of projects in the fields of their study. This kind of experience is quite necessary for fresh graduates to not only deepen their understanding of what they learn from universities but also improve their practical skills. Such opportunity also appeals to potential international students, attracting them to pursue academic degrees in the United States. Besides, the stability in membership of project term is quite important. Frequent turnover in team participation incurs delay and cost associated with recruiting new members.
