I am a foreign student with a STEM degree and I want to fight for my rights. I understand opponents concerns and opinions, but I would like to give the following responses:

1). One of opinions from opponents will be that more and more foreign students will grab employment chances from citizens. Instead, foreign students can create more opportunities for everyone. Many of them stay and work to either develop their current companies or start their own business. Both result in expansion of career market. For instance, the publishing company my wife is working at was founded by Chinese and they hire both Chinese and Americans, as they need people who can speak Chinese for editing and they also need native English speakers to be in contact with administrators, teachers and take charge of marketing and sales. Another thing to note is that, this opposing point doesnt make much sense as the essential reason why its hard to have the opportunity is job hunters ourselves rather than the fact that we have so many competitors. 
2). Another comment from opponents may be that fewer and fewer Americans will study STEM due to more and more foreign students take the positions in high tech companies. Lets take the major of computer science as an example. Then, heres my question looking back to years ago when there were no many foreign students, were there lots of people studying computer science at that time? Apparently no, simply for high-tech industry was not developed yet. Then, thanks to innovation by pioneers and efforts by more and more followers (including the great number of foreign students in recent years), high tech industry starts to thrive and high tech study comes to be the trend that more and more people (no matter theyre foreign or local) have started to devote themselves to study of computer science. We cant simply compare the numbers between foreign students and American students in the job market, rather, a more convincing way should be comparing numbers between no
