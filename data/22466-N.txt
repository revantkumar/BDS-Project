Is it not time for our congress and executive stood up for the citizens. The illegals now have more advantage then the citizens WHO PAY TAX AND THE SALARY TO THE CONGRESS AND THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (PRESIDENT AND HIS STAFF). This is a sad day for our citizens and the worthless congress and president we have.
