I strongly SUPPORT this proposal! As far as what I saw in other comments, one major concern against it is about the competition with international students. Being working at a university, I actually see that international students, even with way better capacity, are much less competitive than native students in the job markets. So the supposed competition does not exist at all. Actually, it is the open attitude towards the brilliant immigrants that made US such a strong nation with the diversity in culture.
