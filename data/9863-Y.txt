I strongly support this proposal not only because it can attract more talents across the world to the US, but also because this will significantly improve the competitiveness of American technological companies and US itself. As we know, the reason why the States is the strongest nation in the world is its tolerance and diversity of the society. In the long run, this policy will continuously strengthen the status of the USA on the global stage and help its companies compete with rivals in other countries!
