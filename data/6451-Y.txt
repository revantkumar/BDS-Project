K P To my view , OPT Students are a big contributor to the American Socitey, They Contribute in Terms of Fess and Taxes as students, Once they get the work Permit() They still contribute with their technical expertise and also supports the economy financially. there are tons of Examples of people who came to this great nation with a dream and passion to make a difference and they became great leaders in their field. The OPT are not stealing Jobs from American People but they are also helping create new jobs, I strongly support the new proposed rule because it will only have positive impact on the Students with STEM extension and the CITIZENS of this great nation. In Midwest we have a saying "The More the merrier" which applies here as well. 

Student with STEM degrees need this extension period so they can contribute to the American society, The CEO and Founder of a Big Indian Online Company like Amazon whose net worth in around 7.5 Billion USD today was a Student here in US, He had to leave US because he didnt get his H1B picked up in Time, imagine that happening here in US. and there are lot of Students with great Idea's and Initiative that can be game changers of tomorrow, most of them are not pursued because it takes time and it can definately not be done in one year of OPT. so please give this Ideas a chance to flourish and grow here in the states.

This folks are not Refugees asking for help but this are people who are young, dynamic, energetic and something to offer to this great nation we are all proud of!!!
