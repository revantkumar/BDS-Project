Expending the STEM OPT program will help the US to recruit talented professionals. The STEM degrees are the advanced degrees of science, technology, engineering, and math. More than 50% of the people who study STEM degrees are international students. These students are cultivated from American colleges and universities. Hiring them is keeping harvests from the advanced education in the US, instead of leaving them back to their own countries. 

Besides, international students will not threaten other Americans to look for jobs. When two people look for one particular job, one is American, and one is a foreigner. If they had equal abilities and professions, the company will prefer American rather than the foreigner because the employer doesn't need to process working visa, green card, or other associated issues. The only reason that a foreigner would be hired is that he/she has substantially better working abilities than others. 

This policy will be beneficial to job markets in the US. In addition, people don't need to worry that foreigners get less pays than Americans. In this new policy, employers have to present the salary proof to indicate the salary is the same with hiring another native speaker. Therefore, this will not deteriorate the salary in the job market.
