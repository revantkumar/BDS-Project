Some people claim, by making the new rule, the government favors foreigners over citizens. This actually makes no sense. I graduated from UCLA, department of electrical engineering. In our master's program, more than 80% of the students are international students. Most of the American citizens are not even interested in the field of STEM, making US high tech companies really hard to find qualified local employees. Many of the US high tech companies have no choice.

If these foreign qualified high tech company employees are forced to leave, it is gonna be a catastrophe for both the employers and the US economy.
