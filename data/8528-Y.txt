This program harms both USA citizens in STEM programs as well as the home countries of EVERY SINGLE STUDENT they send here. This was intended to provide a way of helping under developed nations get their citizens better educated so that the entire country would benefit. Many of them are almost entirely without doctors, due solely to the fact that the students see what America has to offer and stay here rather than return home as they were expected to.

While we deprive other nations desperately in need of these STEM students talents, we also deprive our own citizens (well in excess of 15 million) of jobs they have worked hard to qualify for. It diminishes even the desire for success among all students.

At this time, when Social Security has been robbed of all funds mandatorily taken from citizens, we can ill afford to lose the dollars that CITIZENS taking these jobs would bring in to help solve this crisis.

Your first priority is to citizens of the United States!
