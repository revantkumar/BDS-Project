A Z OPT extension can not only benefit international students, but also local institutions. I am now a foreign language teacher in a public school. However, I only have one year practicing time. In this year, I can come up with a lot of new ideas that I can use in teaching second language, I began to familiar with the whole school system and my students began to know me and my teaching style. Everything is getting better. But because I only have one year OPT, so next year, my school will try to find a new teacher, who will do this all over again. It is hard to find a native speaker, who happened to have higher educational background. If I can have my OPT extension, I might participate language learning research in order to help my student learn other language.

It's a global world now, new people, new idea, more competitive society is inevitable, because it is how we improve. OPT extension is one of the best way to attract "New Blood" to America in order to help develop this country.
