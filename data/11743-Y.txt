The only reason that I come to US to pursuit my master degree is the US offer the OPT extension to STEM student to make sure they have a enough working experiences after graduated to increase their competition in the future, which is very important to student. Now, I have been here near two years and pay a enormous tuition during this period (do a lot of contribution to the USs economy of course ). But suddenly the US government told me that the OPT extension may cancelled...Are you kidding me? I spend a lot of time and money at US, and I may not get the OPT extensions in the end which you already promised us at the beginning. I think keep the promise and have a credit are the basic rules in the human society. Otherwise, why do I need to US to get my degree? Most of the counties such as Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia actively instituting new strategies to attract international students. I could go to those counties since it also has a high quality education and has the lower tuition fee and living cost by compared with US. If the US cancel the OPT extension, the US will never be the top choice for the international students.
