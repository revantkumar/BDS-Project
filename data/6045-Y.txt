I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for OPT extension.

First, America is a country made out of immigrants. One of the reasons that it is a successful country is it is embracing people all over the world and maintaining diversity of the country.

Secondly, OPT is not used to keep unqualified people stay at this country, but give opportunities to those who are excellent and will make a contribution to this world. For now, the process to get H1b is based on lottery, which will force talented people leaving this country. This will be a loss of this country, for sure.

Finally, many international students choose to go to America for study, because of the OPT policy, which give them more chance to get experience from industry. The OPT extension will attract more talented people and that is definitely a good thing for this country.
