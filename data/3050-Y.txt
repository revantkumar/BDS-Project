Hao Li I strongly support the US government expand the OPT STEM extension to 24 months. Not only because it will encourage more international students come to the US, it will also help the development of STEM industries in the US. The truth in the US collages or graduate schools is only a few US citizens would like to choose STEM majors - because it's boring and requires too much effort - while a large portion of the international students are persuing STEM degrees.
