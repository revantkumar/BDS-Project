Tingting Wang I fully support this OPT extension proposal. It is very very important to me and I'm sure, to many new grads like me, as many of us want to continue pursuing our career in academia, which is either working at the universities or doing post-doctoral trainings. And just like the other international students, we need opt to able to do so. Science projects are all complicated, without this extension, it is very unlikely we can accomplish anything in a short period.
