I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. It's the spirit of the states that there is a nicer culturally tolerant regime here. This rule could strongly support this spirit.
2. The international students who are intelligent,kind, and well-educated could bring the country more wealth in terms of all industries and don't cause troubles for the states.
