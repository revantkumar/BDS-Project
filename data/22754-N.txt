I have been involved the Universities Land Grant program of 4-H which is teaching many young member how to make the "Best Better". These members have been working at "STEM" projects for quite awhile now. As they advance they have learned more hands on skills. When these member graduate and (I have four graduates) they cannot find a job because of the ethnicity required. Sometimes the requirements for a job work against the American students. This is another slap in the face of our own student graduates.

The Optional Practical Training program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign students for up to 1 year or up to 29 months in certain fields of study. The program was meant to provide foreign students with on-the-job training that would benefit them when they return to their home countries. Instead, this proposed rule, which will extend the program for STEM students to 36 months, would create a bridge to a longer-term work visa and eventual green card. This is a direct violation of the foreign student's pledge when they received their student visa to leave the country upon graduation. It's hard enough already for American workers, especially recent U.S. graduates, to find work, and this rule would make it even more difficult by adding unnecessary job competition to the mix.
These employers do not have to pay Social Security Taxes and other benefits that they have to pay an U.S. Citizen.
