History has shown that immigrants have made significant contribution to US. Skilled workers, no matter in silicon valley, or east coast, have done a fantastic job in the development of US. We have foreign professors keep exploring the frontiers of science at prestigious universities; we have foreign entrepreneurs make tremendous money as well as pay tremendous tax to this country. It is hard to imagine what the country would be like without the contribution of immigrants.
