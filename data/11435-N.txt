With all due respect, the F-1 program has never been legislated upon by Congress; it is certainly not in the interest of American STEM workers, and will further contribute to the erosion and supplanting of American workers for foreign workers. It is the responsibility of the US Government to protect American workers, regardless of the economic gains promised by underhanded brokers who wish to drive down the wages of legal American workers. The brief savings of wages and benefits to employers of F-1 visa holders is detrimental to all Americans who pay taxes to their government for representation. There is no way a country can continue to collect taxes from it's citizens if they will not represent their own citizens first in all matters related to employment and benefits.

American workers must come first!
