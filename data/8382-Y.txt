I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT policy because it is really a win-win strategy for both US and foreign STEM students. 

I saw the most concern from those people who left negative comments is that they are afraid of losing jobs because of the those students. That is NOT TRUE at all. 

First, the companies, who are willing to hire international students, only take the qualifications into consideration. The E-Verify program is an important measure to ensure the integrity of the STEM OPT extension. To be honest, sometimes even those companies prefer people with citizenship over those who are not when they have the similar background. 

Second, we should realize that the competition can push our citizens to improve themselves and can give our companies more choices so as to maintain their power. That is one of the reasons why US becomes one of the most powerful country in the world. 

Moreover, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries.
