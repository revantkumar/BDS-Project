I believe this rule can benefit both the United Stats and international STEM students. First of all, the nation needs the contribution from international students (think about the foreign employee in the bay area). STEM students usually get their graduate degrees in universities/colleges in the United States. What they learned may be the most advanced science and technology in the world, if they could apply what they have learned to this country, this is definitely a win-win situation.

Second, the rule is quite essential for most of high-tech companies. Since a lot of their employees may under the OPT extension, if the rule is cancelled, most of them may face the situation to leave the US. This will be a diaster for their companies.

Finally, OPT extension let more STEM student get a chance to work in the US, which can help to attract more talented international students coming to the US to pursue their graduate degrees. This may help with the education/economy/...for the US.
