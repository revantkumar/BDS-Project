I do support this new rule. International students are contributing more than gained. For 2014, international students contribute 27B $to US, including study fee, life expenses, etc. Lots of districts have more active economy due to more and more international students, local market have more sales, house sale/rent more, increased lots of services jobs not only in university but also whole community. Data comes from Department of Commerce: economic impact of international students.
It is true that students are taking jobs in STEM industry, but this is not the high pressure area of US for lack of jobs, normal people are benefiting from service job opportunity created by international education and will benefit more in the future.
