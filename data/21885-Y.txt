I do support the extension. 

1.The constitutional law of US determines US is an immigrant country. This is the fundation of US.
2. If the extension were cancelled, a huge number of science or engineering students will not contribute to US. There are very large number of chinese and indian engineers in silicon valley. It will definitely hurt the IT companies. 
3. If the extension were cancelled, it will affect the future international students' choice. Probably they will not be willing to come to US to study as they are today.
4. More good international students come to work in US will be more beneficial to US. They are educated, work hard. It will also improve the native's competitiveness.
