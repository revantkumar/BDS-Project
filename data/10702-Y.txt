Steven Yin As an international student, I strongly support this OPT extension act for the following reasons:
1. The United States always propergate its spirit of equality and human rights for people from different racial and cultural background to the whole world. Cancelling this act, squeezing graduates' legal working time in U.S. soil, is undoubtedly a shameful challenge to the foundation of this country.
2. What's more, international students are already at a disadvantage in finding jobs compared with domestic students. A large amount of companys and firms have already not provided sponsorships to new international employees, which means they will be laid off after their OPT period. So, extension of OPT is surly a necessary method to amend this unequal situation, which holds even far more sagacious meaning of realizing equality in U.S. 
3. Last but not least, a lot international students are more excellent, with respect but to be honest, than domestic students. The employer should enjoy it's freedom to pick the best potential employees to make its blueprint come true. Rejection of this act also do heavy harm to employers, resulting in great loss in both HR and capital aspect.

Equality is the foundation of US establishment, we should honor it!
