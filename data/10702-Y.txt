I think this is a great thing.

I was kind of shocked when I heard the OPT Extension cancellation. I felt angry and helpless at that time. After all, I came to US with hope, and then I worked very hard just try to fit in and get a good GPA. One day after getting of work, my friend told me about it. It looked like someone with huge power can just naturalize every step I've take in the past 2 years. 

Now the new rule has been proposed, I see hope again.
