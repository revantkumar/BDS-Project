I strongly support the proposed rules.
We are the promising and excellent students who want to study in America. We study hard to be outstanding in our country and bear loneliness to study in America. We love the contry and want to make a difference for US. Thanks to the opportunity of further education in US and we will be appreciated for the oppotunity of continuing in the country. Please give us a chance and give us a reason to love US. We will study hard and work hard for ourselves and for US.
