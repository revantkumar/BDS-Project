Zhaopu Zhou I strongly support the extension.

With the extension, millions of people can get benefit.
When I was applying for a graduate school, I consider U.K, Canada and U.S. Because I know that U.S. have great OPT program, so I came to U.S. And I spend huge amount of money, which make a great economic benefit to the U.S.

If there's no OPT program, U.S. will lost billions of billions of dollar from the International Student.
