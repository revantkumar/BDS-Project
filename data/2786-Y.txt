I highly support for this STEM extension proposal. I think this regulation will increase the competitive advantages of US in the global market and benefit general people who lives in this country. 

Firstly, Americans always have the priority of getting jobs, and this proposal will not increase the pressure of citizens and green card holders for getting jobs. The majority of companies in US will choose to hire the citizens first, because they do not want to pay extra money and time for the international students. So, seldom can international students get jobs from citizens. Also, international employees should pay about 15 percent of their income to US as tax, which can release the economical pressure of US society and the US government can better build the US medical system and other systems to better serve US citizens.

Secondly, it will improve the competitiveness of US companies among the world. All these international students are very intelligent and gained valuable knowledge from US universities. And all the STEM majors are very practical, these international students can US companies more ideas and help them to make suitable modifications when selling products in other countries. For example, if these IT companies, which contribute a lot to the US economics, will get into a panic without help with the STEM extension.

Thirdly, the opt and H1b system is not flexible, and not all the students may get the chance of using OPT and STEM extension because of the identity issue. This will reduce the attractiveness of staying in US. So, there will not be a large number of international students left in the US.
