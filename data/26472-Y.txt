I did my Masters in computer Science in a reputed university. In my masters programme only three students were American and the rest 400 were international students. There are close to 40,000 vacant jobs in new york city alone. There is a severe demand for qualified STEM workers. Masters students like me possess very good knowledge in the subject matter and are highly qualified to take up the jobs. It's good for USA to retain STEM students by providing a good scenario to work rather then asking us to leave to become a competition.
