Madeleine Grant If this rule is issued then international stdents will stayin USA for longer time and they may start their own enterprises in USA with ideas and experience they have accumulated from around the world. Diversity is what makes this country the best country in the world. If this rule is not issued then I think we are going to loose our identity. STEM graduates should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. International STEM graduates are the Key to the U.S.'s Economic Future.
