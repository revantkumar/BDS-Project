Kai Yang US is an immigration country. One of the most important reason that US lead the world's economy is that it welcomes talents from all over the world. Right now, lots of talents have obtained their degrees at top schools in US and are looking forward to a career in US. Why US should want to shorten their opt? The recent proposal by DHS to increase STEM extension to 24 month is a courageous and inspiring move, and it will prove to benefit US's economy. I strongly support this proposal!
