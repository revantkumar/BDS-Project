US needs a lot of STEM students. But with the current OPT policy, many students, both graduate or undergraduate cannot get pass the H1B lottery process to finally get an H1B visa. They have to leave America. This is a big damage to the American economy considering the number of STEM international students that miss the H1B is very large.
To make the OPT into 12+24 months and enlarge the chance of getting a H1B for international students. And I think it is better to change the law into that giving every STEM students a H1B or green card automatically when they get the degree, just like many other countries do, say Canada.
Anyway, it is a good progress to extend the OPT time to 36 months. It is definitely good to US.
