Leonard Lambert International Students added a whooping 26.8 billion dollars to US economy in a single year of 2013-2014. STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy. One of our richest sources of employment and economic growth will be jobs that require skills in these areas, collectively known as STEM. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A. Improving and expanding the training opportunities won't cut the jobs availabilities of US citizens significantly but this will stimulate American to improve themselves to become more competitive and increase the profits of companies to open more available positions.
