Baishen Xu I strongly support the OPT extension for STEM students.

The regulation being approved would benefit not only international students but also companies and universities in the US. The Optional Practical Training would help international students gain more professional experience before they decide on their career path and this process would clearly take more than 12 months. Besides, OPT extension provides US companies the opportunities to hire the top talents in STEM fields and keep them in the country. Also, the OPT extension for STEM students ensures that US educational institutions stay competitive in the world. Without the regulation, the attractiveness of US universities would greatly decrease.
