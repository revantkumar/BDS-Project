Many citizen says that OPT students have lower pay and companies prefer to hiring them. What a ridiculous opinion! OPT students work as interns in their OPT, so it is normal that they have lower pay. Even citizens work as interns, they will have lower pay compared with regular workers! I think citizens should require company increase intern's salary but not anti-OPT. OPT rules actually create such huge wealth for US. If the rule fails, it will be a disaster for high-tech companies! May OPT pass!
