The new rule would definitely benefit both U.S STEM industry and international students. STEM students received U.S education resources (most of them have scholarships, or professors' funding), they should contribute to this county instead of leaving soon after graduate. 
And this policy would not harm citizens' job seeking. Recent years, STEM enterprises and startups need more and more technical employees. Citizens with STEM degrees can find jobs much easier than international students because they don't need further VISA sponsorship.
