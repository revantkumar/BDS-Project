Who Creates Jobs? How jobs are created Please be awake to the fact that jobs are created by making innovations, designing good products, and providing better services. I can't expect a prosperous economy if America is isolated from the global competitions. Yes, removing foreign workers will save our America some jobs; but simply removing foreign talents will let our tech companies down in today's global competition. I prefer the market to do its job. I want more US companies to be leaders in their sectors and create more jobs, but not disappear because of the failures in acquiring talents. So, the DHS should support STEM students while rule a fair OPT wages.
