Michael Zhang I fully SUPPORT OPT extension rule because it benefits both U.S. economy and foreign workers. Some people may concern that foreign workers take positions from citizens, but actually not at all. As everyone knows, foreign workers have made a great contribution to the development of U.S. industries, with this development, more and more job positions have been created. However, without OPT extension, not only some foreign workers will lose their jobs, it is also a disaster to U.S. industries and economy. At that time, less workers will be needed which still hurt cizitens. I believe this is not everyone wants. So I totally support OPT extension rule.
