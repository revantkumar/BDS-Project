The new recommendations made by DHS to the STEM OPT extension program are very reasonable. I especially laud the proposal to extend the duration of the current STEM extension, which, in combination with the 12-month OPT, is in step with a typical grant cycle on which a majority of science OPT employees are hired. 

The transition period from degree to permanent employment is precarious Because of the current shorter STEM extension periods, many STEM employees are forced to switch to different visa classes (commonly J- or H1 visas) in order to continue pursuing training in their relevant fields, especially in biomedical research. An extended OPT period would provide both the STEM candidates as well as their employers reasonable time to ponder employment options once the training period is over. 

Moreover, often enough (and once again, more frequently observed in biomedical sciences), STEM graduates opt to take up training under a second (and less commonly, third) mentor in order to broaden their scope of training, or simply due to incompatibilities with the primary mentor (an example of this is postdoctoral training, and this has been extensively covered by leading science journals http://www.nature.com/news/the-future-of-the-postdoc-1.17253) Under these circumstances, trainees would "use up" crucial months of the STEM employment period without many productive gains. 

Keeping in mind the foregoing circumstances, I recommend adding an option to further extend the STEM extension period to 36 months (instead of the proposed 24 months).
