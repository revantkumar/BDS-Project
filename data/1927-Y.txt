I strongly support this rule for these reasons as follows:
First,since I just been here for several months as an international student, I already found that so much area need foreigners to do it. beacuse native people are unwilling to do them. so much students come to US to study IT or in other area,they bring the GDP for US and it's good for US's future to become more steady and strong country.

Secondly, I came here for just only several years to study,if we all international students came back to my country just after our graduation , I can feel United State economy will go down immediately, because US pushed so many high quaility educated talent student back to other country. 

Thirdly, United States don't have so much population to running all the economy chain, especially for the high salary.
