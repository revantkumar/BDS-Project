Will Li I got my Chem PhD this August and now am a Postdoctoral scholar working in UCLA using my OPT and I got my OPT extension approved recently. As a international student who acquired a STEM Degree in states, I sincerely appreciate the opportunity for working in the states legally and I would like to deliver my strongest support to expanding OPT period from 1t months to 24 months for several reasons:
1. All the STEM graduates are the guys who can contribute their knowledge to the States which are very valuable and their may create more technology progress and job opportunities which might benefit all over the country.
2. From my personal experience, 12 months is quite a narrow period to finish a project which usually requires more than 24 months to get real progress, so it will be reasonable to give these people who works during OPT period a relative long time scale to focus on their work, not worry about the ending of working permit very soon.

Finally, I believe all the people who is or has been benefited the OPT policy really appreciate this policy and the training here will make them more competitive and marketable if they decide to go back to their own countries.
