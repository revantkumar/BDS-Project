I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates, returning Veterans, out-of-work American Citizens struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. The role of the U.S. Government should be to promote the interests of its own citizens above and beyond non-citizens. This rule seems to support non-citizens above and beyond U.S. Citizens and should be removed immediately from any consideration.
