I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the foreign students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Diversity is important for the U.S.

2. Competition is not a bad thing. Competition can help the U.S. get more better talents and improve global competitiveness.And the fact truth is that foreign students usually take the jobs that cannot find suitable local people to do.
