STEM OPT extension should be passed for the following reasons.
Firstly, STEM OPT is for those who don't own a green card but still wanna stay in America for study. Don't you think it is counterintuitive that students learn knowledge but leave immediately without adding values to USA?
Secondly, USA, as an open-minded country, welcomes people regardless their nationality and colour of skin. So there is no wonder America ranks first in the academic field. If students are driven away once they complete their program, how can the talents contribute to America financially and academically?

Above all, I strongly recommend that STEM OPT extension should be passed as a rule.
