I welcome this rule with my open arms, STEM extension is something which was promised and vacating it would be completely unjustified. This extension would not only give foreign students the opportunity to practice their degree but also give them the American experience which later they can take back with pride and help their respective nation. I guess that's what American spirit teaches us, and that's why we love America.
