OPT extension is not only important for the international students, but also for the US technical company. If there is no OPT extension, mostly international students need leave USA since there are so few people could get their H1B in 12 months. Some of them have already worked in the technical companies in US and there would be a great loss for these companies. In that condition, the industry will be affected. So the OPT extension firstly will offer the international students chances to realize their career dream and finally help the technical industrial development.
