I strongly support this proposal because of the following reasons:

1. One big reason that International students came to United States to study is due to OPT, especially STEM OPT which allow them to work legally after study. If OPT was canceled or shortened, then a lot of them will go to other countries for study (i.e. UK, UK's master/phD program is shorter and cheaper in total; HK, HK's master/phD program is even shorter than UK), which makes US less attractive and will be a huge damage on US GDP and US economy.

2. For thoes students who already in STEM OPT Extension, if STEM Extension is canceled or shortened, what should they do? So only longer STEM OPT is possible since it is impossible to cut so many employees who is already in STEM OPT extension.

3. STEM as four of the hardest field of higher education requires tremendous hard work, talent, dedication to finish the study, especially for Master, and PhD programs. In other words, successful candidates possess unique talents and characters that can help US economy innovation, and help boost US exocomy prosperity. 

4. Currently, Corporate America is cutting hiring from OPT candidates due to a highly/crutial H1B lottery process. By extending H1B longer can help hiring managers make correct decisions without considering candidates nationalities/race/gender, and only focus on their core competitiveness, which I believe is the spirit of EEO.

To sum up, extend STEM OPT can only be good to US economy since the first day international students landed US territory till they started to make contribution in Corporate America. Therefore, I strongtly agree this proposal and I even think STEM OPT should be extended longer!
