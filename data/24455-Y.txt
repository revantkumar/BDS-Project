I strongly SUPPORT this new policy.
Most of the foreign students are strictly selected in order to come to the US. They are most talented people and are most likely to contribute to the US society greatly. A lot of American's economy/technology/etc contributors are those who made their way because of STEM policy. If not approved, it would be a big loss.
