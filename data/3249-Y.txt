As an MIT alum, it pains me to see so many hardworking, brilliant, honest people sent away from the US a year or two after they get their degrees.

From a self-interested point of view, this is a great opportunity for the US -- attracting and retaining educated immigrants who are working in high tech, high value sectors is an investment in our own economy. 

This is an opportunity to encourage people who are willing and capable to work in the US in a sector of our economy for which demand far outweighs supply to stay in the States and contribute.

As long as there is a great demand for jobs in STEM that the US is currently not filling, and as long as STEM fields are investments in the entire economy, we should be allowing immigrants who prove their dedication to stay.
