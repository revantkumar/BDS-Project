I'm surely to support this new policy not just because it's beneficial to international students but also it's beneficial to US people too.
I think it's really abvious that international students are very significant to a lot of US people, such as the people in the education system and the landlords. As a Chinese student, i would say that the US is NOT the only choice to get education, because sometimes the policy like OPT could be the most reason for us to choose where to go and recently, some countries like Australia have really nice, friendly policies for international students to work there. I must say these policies are very attractive to us, so many of my classmates are applying for Australia's universities, as for me, i apply for both Australia and America because i know that some students don't get an OPT and have to come back to China which means they don't have much time to improve their language skills and get an international horizon, but that is why we want to go to America.
Every year, there are so many Chinese students choose America to get education, which is beneficial to US's education system and economy. But you should know that because of the unfriendly working policy, many students have changed their decision and i think it is a bad news for US.
There's no doubt that US is still very attractive to Chinese students and i think if this new policy comes true, it's beneficial to US and you know the reason.
