I strongly disagree with this proposal. I am a Chinese student with a green card, I have Chinese friends with F1 Visa in STEM majors and find a job here within a very short time after their graduation. Obviously they are very smart and hold a good degree from reputable universities. Even my Chinese friends who studies Business major find an employer that sponsored her Visa. Many of them told me that the experience was tough and many of them were under high pressure in that period. But the fact showed us the people who are outstanding will eventually find jobs and stay.
I also have classmates who came from China and dreamed about staying in America, they don't study hard, they don't have money to invest in US companies, they don't even have good qualities as being a nice/kind person. I don't know what will happen if they stay here longer and longer and accidently find a stupid employer who give them sponsorship and let those people stay... I myself saw lots of this kind of students doing "wrong" things, they don't deserve the chance or have the talents to stay here.
People who should and is capable to find a job will eventually stay here, AMERICA only want talented GOOD people, but not useless naive teenagers.
If they were under pressure due to search jobs, that's so normal, because they are FOREIGNERS!
I am Chinese and I live here, I still love my home country and I don't mind to go back anyway. Why are them all thinking of staying here? If America is so good that they don't want to leave, that's because AMERICANS BUILT SUCH A NICE COUNTRY! Why don't those people go back to build their own country AS GOOD AS AMERICA SO THEY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THERE AS WELL?!

LEAVE AMERICAN JOBS TO AMERICANS! 
AND GOOD STUDENTS WILL FIND JOBS AND THEY NEVER EVER WORRIES ABOUT ANY PROPOSAL LIKE THIS, BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCELLENT!
