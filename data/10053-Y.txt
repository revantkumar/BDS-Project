I strongly support the proposal of OPT extension (24 months). Overall,it will be beneficial to the US government.

1. The US employers need STEM students to work for their companies. Some talented students actually made good effort on their current jobs. It will be a big impact if a group of people leaving these companies (country) due to this cancellation.

2. The new OPT extension (24 months) will attract more international and talented students to come to the US for study. International students actually spent a lot of money in the US and help to boost the economy right now. The cancellation will make these group go to Australia or UK. 

Therefore, there is no reason to disagree with this proposal.
