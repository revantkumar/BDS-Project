Many International students prefer to go back to their country after a period of 5 years once their tuition loans are cleared and they have saved some money. So, such students have to go through the H1B ordeal just for 2 more years.

It would be better if the OPT extension is increased to 5-6 years as it would in turn GREATLY reduce the H1B applications thus making things easier for USA Immigration dept too.
