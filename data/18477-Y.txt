YES! I DO SUPPORT the OPT-extension. It is a win-win strategy for both US and international students.

First of all, international students have made tremendous contributions to the growth of US economy especially in science and technology areas in these years. 

Additionally, it is a loss for all US tech companies if they cannot hire talent international students just because they are not born here. With more and more outstanding STEM international students who have been educated in the US working for foreign companies, it will be really hard for the US tech companies to maintain their market share around the world. 

Moreover, it is ridiculous to say that international students are occupying the positions which should belong to US citizens. All the companies which can provide OPT-extension are e-verified. This means that they hire people without discrimination. US citizens will definitely get the job if then have equal skills and capability. US citizens even get more opportunities because they can work in the US without any restrictions. On the contrary, those tech companies are risking potential loss to hire international employees because of the H1B lottery system. 

Last but not least, the growth of US economy because of the the advanced techniques created by both US citizens and international works together will surely bring more positions for the whole country.
