Jinming shi As a international student, I strongly support the proposal for the several reasons:
First, there is no doubt that creating some positions for student intern and working are significant important to the development of many realms including IT industry and so on. Some graduates have already make huge contributions to the U.S. society, the CEO of google technology, some leaders were international students since they arrived in the U.S, being a student is the first step to achieve the success in their lives. Looking back to the two decades, international students have made such a paramount achievement. 
Second, diversity is a definitive characteristic of American society. Not only the politician, but also the leaders of huge companies do propose the social diversity. It's a flag and spirit of the place where were are striving. Speaking of Einstein, he is a German scientist who comes to American where he can enjoy the peace and harmony in the society including many races. 
The most important reason is that competition promoting the the development of society. those people who can't find a job or complain the difficulty in looking for a job are negative. Th reason why they lose their job are the competition in the industry. if they were skillful or competitive, they can always find a decent job soon or later. 
So supplying an opportunity for international student interning their respective subjects is a good way to improve our society, promote the evolution of technology.
