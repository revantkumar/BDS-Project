I strongly support the STEM OPT Extension!Some American said that the opt extention will help the international students rob Americans of their jobs.I'm afraid not. Opt Extension doesn't mean that the number of H-1B visas have been increased. The number keep 80000 every year,which means no matter extension or not, the legal foreign labors will increase at the same rate every year. What's more, including the labors who failed to get the H-1B last year, the probability of the lucky dogs who succeed getting the H-1B will be less and less, which in turn will keep the total amount of H-1B and OPT labors stable.However, the OPT Extension will definitely attract more students to go to America to study. Think about it, the amount of foreign labors keep steady,whereeas the international students increase. How could this possibly damage the benefits of Americans? On contrary,this will certainly give a boost the American economy. In a word,the opt extension can only benifit the Americans, but not the negetive effects.
