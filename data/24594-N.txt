I would like to know why there is such an emphasis on foreign workers in STEM. It is well documented that HB-1 visas and other manipulations of the labor pool serve to drive down wages in all fields. With the cost of 4 year degrees skyrocketing sharp young men and women are forced to pursue degrees that will best enable them to repay high education costs. If the labor pool remains unmanipulated wages will rise and students will rush to fill shortages in well-compensated fields. Please explain why taking actions that directly harm Americans is in the best interest of our country.
