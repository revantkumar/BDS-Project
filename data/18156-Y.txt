I support for expanding the training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students. It's a way to greatly enhance the diversity of a university, to improve the cultural and academic exchange of different countries, that will make the US more competitive in attracting foreign students. In addition, foreign students bring both economy development and cultural prosperity, that will greatly promote the development in many aspects.
