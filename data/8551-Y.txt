Siyu Cong Docket number: ICEB-2015-0002
I am a Electrical Engineer in San Diego, California. I got my master degree in UCLA in March of 2015. I think approval of extend OPT is a win win for both America and foreigners like me. 

Usually new graduates in engineering need one year training before they can really work independently and make contributions to the companies. If we can only work here for one year, then all the training and money that the companies spend on us are wasted.

Since H1B visa is not guaranteed, engineers from foreign countries like me really need extended opt to work in America. We really appreciate the opportunities and working environment in America. And we are more than happy to stay here and make contributions to America by our own efforts.

So I totally support extend OPT.
