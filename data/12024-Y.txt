The international students who got jobs after graduation can make big contribution to the company. Before I got my working visa, I worked harder than US employees, usually I want to work 10 hours a day to just prove my manager. I can see as international employee, my attitude and my hard work can make a difference for our company, and also can make positive competition among other employees which eventually help company grow. I also have US coworkers who is not so happy for foreign students are not so competitive that they may hope to be protected by the law. However, if no foreign students those people still can't be competitive and it's not a healthy or good way to solve their issue.
