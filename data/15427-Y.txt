I strongly agree with the new proposal of Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees. 

The new regulation will bring more opportunities for STEM students to work in the US and benefit the US economy. By passing the new proposal, STEM students can have sufficient time to practice what they've learnt in their real work in the US, which will create a win-win situation for both sides.
