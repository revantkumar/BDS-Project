As an immigrant, I know the challenges of pursuing a higher education in a foreign country. I know that I have been provided with a great opportunity by coming to the United States and so I want to take advantage of the resources that are available to me. 

I strongly believe that this rule and the skills learned through OPT and STEM programs will better position students to begin careers in their fields of study. However, I also believe that these benefits should be extended to students trying to pursue a career in fields of study other than science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 

I believe that other provisions could be implemented to benefit a larger range of students trying to pursue a higher education. I know that it takes a lot of research to forecast the costs and benefits of a new rule, but it is worth going through this process when the benefits outweigh the costs, especially if more people can benefit from it. I hope that the necessary provisions can be made to ensure that educational opportunities are extended to students who are pursuing a career in law, business, teach, and other fields of study as we can all bring growth to this nation.
