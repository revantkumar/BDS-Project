I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. the STEM extension would help retain the US universities as attractive destination for world class education. it would encourage more students to come and study in american institutions and work and gain experience and contribute to the technological innovation and economical growth. 

Reducing the STEM extension would largely deter the students all over world to come to America to study. Like what happened in England post 2012 VISA rules. England educational institutions are no more the in the priority list of international students, because they would not get an opportunity to implement the theoretical learnings in industrial world England. Students come to USA because of the world class research facilities, endless opportunities. 

So i fully support the STEM Extension to 24 months
