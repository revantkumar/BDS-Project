I abdolutely SUPPORT the proposal for the new 24 month-extension of STEM OPT. Three reasons are worthy of mentioning: 1. The U.S. should let the international students majoring in a STEM subject stay longer in the country as this can continously boost the technological and economic development of the U.S. U.S. has a long history of immigration friendly policy which makes the country strong annd thriving. The dominating status of the U.S. in the world in science and technology nowadays is largely owing to the contribution made by millions of scientific and technological talents coming from all over the world. Without their contribution, a lot of domestic industries could not have been so prosperous, e.g. IT.
