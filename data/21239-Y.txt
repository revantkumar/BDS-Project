I strongly support this extension for the following reasons:
1. Longer OPT for newly-graduated STEM students will guarantee the workforce that American technology companies need, thus ensuring that they would be able to contribute to the nation's economy in a long run. Longer OPT also means a better deal to train a new employee with F-1 visa, who can, if with the extension, work and make value for the company for over 2 years instead of just couple of months after the first few months of induction training. Same cost and more profits, why not.
2. As for some critical voice complaining that International students are taking jobs from the Americans, those arguments do not hold water. Companies hire people after reviewing their education and work background and examining their professional skills in interviews. It is a fair competition, which is never about the nationality, but always about the competency. Especially in STEM fields, no one is getting hired because of where he comes from, but despite of. 
3. Equality is what makes the United States the United States. The F-1 nonimmigrant students, who have completed the graduate degrees in the states, deserve a fair amount of time to practice here too. Considering the difficulty for a foreigner to do that, 3 years is reasonable.
