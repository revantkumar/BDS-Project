I strongly support this proposal for two reasons:

1. It will attract foreign students to U.S. In 2014, over 300,000 F1 visa were issued to international student, who would stay and spend on average 50,000 tuition per year. That is about 15 billion dollar business for U.S colleges. Without OPT program, these international students probably won't come to U.S., cause the degree in U.S. would actually bring them nothing if there is no working opportunity after they graduate. I would suspect that would bring a dramatic drop on our university business. 

2. The STEM extension program makes U.S. companies more competitive than these in other countries. The best and most talented foreign students get hired by the U.S companies after they graduate an stay in U.S, keeping benefiting the U.S economy. It is a brain drain from other countries. 

Overall, the OPT STEM extension program benefits the U.S. economy and should be supported.
