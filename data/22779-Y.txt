Hi dhs,

This is a great proposal.This will allow the opt/stem student to work in the us improve the economy.

The international students pay about 2 times fees as much of a local american student does.
The opt students are not paying only the social secuirty taxe and medicare for a peroid only during there opt duration only.

many comapnies will not prefer opt student over citiziens because they will have to deal with there extra paper work
. since there is a storage of skilled workers in stem feilds the comapnies are hiring the opt student with advanced degrees(masters and phd).
if they did not find a citizen with equal qualifications.

I would like support this rule as opt students will be able to contribute to the us economy from the degree(master /phd)from a us university will be useful.
