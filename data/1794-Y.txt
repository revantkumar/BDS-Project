I agree to the Extension of OPT.
Yes we do have native STEM workers. But we don't have enough qualified STEM workers. Some of the so called native STEM graduates are not as smart as those international students and they are more laid back than their international competitors. U.S. is a nation that welcomes smart people. If we reject those good candidates, how could we win the competition with rising powers like China and India? On the contrary, if we can absorb those smart students to our country, the best work forces of those rising powers will be drained by us.
Use your brain to think, you will find the extension of opt is of the best interest to America.
