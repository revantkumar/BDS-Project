F Singh STEM Extension is a must have for all the F-1 visa students. It not only is essential for the learning experience of students. 
F1 visa students and their families helped create 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year. A lot of people commenting against do not understand this. 
F1 students receive a quality education from the US universities and provide a skilled workforce for this country and do all this LEGALLY. No F-1 student is ever preferred over a US citizen when it comes to jobs. Its infact quite opposite. More often than not, F-1 visa students are not even considered for various job openings. Every one gets a fair chance, and in order for this country to succeed we need people who are more deserving for a certain role based on their skills and talent, not based on where they were born. 

Therefor I completely support this rule and appreciate DHS for understanding the value of international students unlike bunch of not so worthy people.
