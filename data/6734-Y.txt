By allowing foreign STEM workers to stay longer in the US, you are doing two things that are wrong. First, you are taking STEM jobs away from US citizens by providing employers with cheap "slave" labor. Second, you are lowering wage rates of technical jobs that DESERVE higher pay.

Mr. President, you need to take whatever steps are necessary to help bring manufacturing jobs to the USA. You don't need to bring foreign tech workers in to do this. High paying tech jobs help stimulate the economy, since people would have more disposable income to buy US- made goods. Let the foreign STEM workers go back to their native countries so they can make improvements there.

Please don't cave in to the greedy CEOs that are only looking after their own interests. If anything, there needs to be limits set on CEO compensation. They should not be paid more than five or even ten times more than what the hourly employees of the company are paid. No company executive should be paid more than the President of the United States.
