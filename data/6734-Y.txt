Anonymous Anonymous I fully support the new regulation.
It benefits the universities which in turn supports nations finance.
It also benefits students which in turn benefit the growth of the country by their skills and help others around them grow as well.
This new regulation very important and I fully support it as it will be good for the growth of the nation and the growth of the entire world !
