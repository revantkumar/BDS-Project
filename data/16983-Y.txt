As a potential international student about to enroll in 2016, I would like to show my highest support for the opt extension. I find it hard to understand why being a non US citizen should be the obstacle stopping me to achieve my dream. Since I've lived in the U.S. previously, I think of Americans as the most suitable presentation of freedom and justice. I understand that people worry about the competition brought by us, but there are many international students who have gone to create the best invention and progress in the world. I don't think competition is a bad thing, since it is my life in the U.S. that taught me that competition brings innovation and progress.I want to apply my knowledge learnt in the highest institute here to benefit the people here, what's wrong with that?
