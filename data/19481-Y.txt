I absolutely support the proposal. OPT is one of important reason that USA education is attractive for many international student. OPT is not a permanent permission for F1 students. it only provides opportunity for student to get involved in their own specific field and gain working experience. Most student will come back after OPT work. But if the OPT time is only one year which is very limited experience for student to earn real working experience especially for STEM student. Mostly work spend one year as a training period for entry-level employees. how could f1 student get chance to have really work within this short time? Besides, USA education and society get a lot of benefit from international education, and excellent students educated from USA also improve USA international status and influence. OPT only provided by high-tech field which could not be a threaten for general working opportunity.
