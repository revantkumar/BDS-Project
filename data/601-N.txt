As a citizen of the United States of America, I have a RIGHT to apply for a job on a level playing field. If MY education or experience puts me at a disadvantage, so be it. I can change the variables.

There is no way a citizen can compete for a job with a non-citizen when prospective employers receive financial incentives to hire non-citizens. It is even more insulting to know that the financial incentive is suppied by my government using my own money!!

In addition, the Department of Homeland Security has absolutely no business proposing this regulation. Their sole responsibilty is to provide security to the citizens of the United States of America. 

If Homeland Security just has to spend money the American people don't even have, why not provide more incentives to employers to hire citizens? Yes, there are a few programs available now, but why not expand them?
