I fully support the proposed rulings because the changes will benefit the technology development in the US greatly. Many international students come to the US for education opportunities each year. The ones who get admitted to colleges/graduate schools here are usually the best students from individual country. They are smart, and they work hard. The education that they receive here in the US helps them broaden their technical skill sets, and improve their communication skills. The international students benefit from their study experiences. The advancement of technology relies on good understanding of science behind it. The education the students received also help them better understand science. Thus, ensuring the elite to apply what they learned will help the advancement of technology here in the US. Expanding the training opportunities for F-1 students creates this welcoming environment for the diligent people who also have brilliant ideas.
