I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for following reasons:
1International students who get a degree in America should stay to continue to make a contribution to US economy.Currently, US companies recruit international students when they cannot find a suitable candidate from Americans. If international students can stay, they can contribute to US economy.

2 Many famous scientists who won Noble Prize are international students. They make a good contribution to US. Suppose an international student who work for a company by using his or her OPT who have to leave US due to the against of an extension of OPT, it would cause a lot of damage to the company and US economy.

3 Some people say international students increase competition. I admit that, but I have to say competition makes US more stronger. Competition will only increase an awareness of people that they have to work hard.
