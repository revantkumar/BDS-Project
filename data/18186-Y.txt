I definitely agree the OPT extension.
I am a MS student of Institute of Optics, University of Rochester. I have just been in America for 3 months. I am intended to pursue my PhD degree here in America, so maybe this extension for OPT will not affect my life until 5-6 years later, I find myself already be affected by this regulation.
First of all, the United States have been famous for its diversity. The society consists of people with different nationalities, background and characteristics, all of them are fundamental parts of America, and also, diversity is the reason that America can attract the most talented people. How can the young talented graduated students contribute to the society, if they are not given the fair chance to fight for their positions here.
Take myself as an example, I had got plenty of attractive chance to stay in China, but I gave up all of them to put myself in this melting pot, being eager to learn and tested in the most challenging society in the world. I hope I won't let myself down, and the United States will not let me down.
Last but not the least, I have known some many friends here in America, a great number of them are from outside of America. They are working hard to fight for what they deserve and will contribute to the area of optics, which is a promising area of fundamental science. Now we study together, what about 5 years later, so we can work together to make great progress. I am looking forward to that day, so the OPT extension will enhance the chance.
