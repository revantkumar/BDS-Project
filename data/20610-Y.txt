This rule makes sense! Many of us have gone to US schools here to get our Masters/PhD degrees. When the time comes to practice our profession in the US, even after getting a job offer, we have to rely on a lottery system for getting H-1b work status in order to be eligible to work. This year, the odds of winning the lottery were about 1 to 3! After all the rigors of getting a higher education US degree, going through interviews and finding a good job offer, it seems very unfair that we have to rely on a lottery system to put our hard-earned knowledge and skills to work and meaningfully contribute to society. 

This proposed rule is surely not a panacea to the problem. But, it would definitely go some distance in helping us to work and while working, give us the opportunity to apply for the H-1b work visa lottery a couple of times.
