I really hope that this 24-month rule can be approved. It's not easy for an employer to find an appropriate employee, and it will be a big loss to the company if the employee has to leave the company after 12 months. STEM fields' students need years of time to gain actual industrial experience and then they can make substantial contributions to the company. Therefore a 24-month extension will benefit both the employer and employee.
