I think the proposal is beneficial for the United States both for its economy and its ability to attract talented people in the future. Below are the specific reasons:

1. Hundreds and thousands of international students work for U.S. companies after graduation with the Optional Practical Training. If their OPT cannot be expanded, it is likely that they will not be able to work for their companies given the fact that H1B lottery is highly competitive. What does this mean to these companies? They lose talented employees and suffer from economic lost because productivity cannot be maintained and extra investment of time and money are needed to look for new candidates who are qualified for the job. To make the situation worse, those who graduate from STEM programs are trained in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. To be frank, such talents are hard to come across. The united States surely does not want to see its companies suffering from such talent loss just because their foreign workers are no longer eligible to work in this country to which they are contributing. 

2. The proposal helps attract more talents in the future. It is a win-win. As far as I know, many international students choose to advance their education in the United States partly because of the prospect of working here after graduation. If the length of OPT cannot be expanded, STEM programs are less attractive to prospective students.
