Definitely a GREAT proposal that enhances US competitiveness around the world. US is strong because our technology stands on the cutting edge. And high-tech students around the world should always be welcomed. The most stupid thing on earth is to let US universities teach foreign students all kinds of high-tech skill sets and then send them back to their home countries and finally to compete and beat down our own tech industry!!! Leave them in the US! That will keep our country strong in the tech industry.
