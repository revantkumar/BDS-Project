If you have not noticed it yet, so many high tech companies now heavily rely on immigrants for their workforce. Companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and etc hire many new college graduates each year, and a great portion of them are F-1 students with STEM. They contribute tremendously to America's economy, and also leading the technology trend in the globe. Stopping STEM extension will drive them back to their home countries and potentially will make America's economy in an unfavorable position.

I saw many negative comments on this issue related to wages, claiming that companies hire OPT students and underpaying them. I do not know their source, but as an employee in a high tech company, I never saw companies underpaid OPT workers because they are nonimmigrants. To the contrary, these workers are among the highest paid fresh graduates among US. I doubt wage concern had a valid standpoint.
