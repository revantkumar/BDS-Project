As a Chinese junior student, I strongly support this proposed rule. I plan to apply a university of USA for further studying when I graduate, and the OPT extension is necessary for me or other international students to gain rich industrial experience when we graduate from an American university.

If this proposed rule is not passed, international students will have very limited time to work in USA, and in that case, our work efficiency will decrease in a great deal since we have to worry about our work status. In the long run, this is not good for both the students and the American companies, thus influencing the economy and development of USA.

As a junior student, if this rule is not passed, I think it will have a great impact on our decision for university selections. We may tend to go to Singapore or other countries for further study. And I think this is also not good for USA.

Therefore, I do hope this proposed rule will pass, which is beneficial for both international students and USA.
