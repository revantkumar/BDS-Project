I strongly hold that OPT should be extended to 29 months or longer for F-1 students for following reasons. 
First of all, this policy could attract more talent international students all over the world, make them get educated and work in U.S., which definitely enhance the world leading role of U.S. both in science and technology. If OPT gets shorter, domestic people or U.S. citizens may find jobs easier. However, this has no benefit to the future of U.S.
Secondly, these international students working in U.S. do have special skills or high expertise. It is fair enough that they get through fierce competition with others even U.S. citizens to get a job. There is a job, there is competition even if no international student is eligible.
Furthermore, there are other feasible solutions to the unemployment of domestic people, for example, encouraging small business and increasing investment on infrastructure. What we should do is to boost economy so that no one is unemployed. Cutting OPT period is the last thing we should do.
