I always thinking the sprit of the inclusiveness is one of the most precious value of American people. If international students who are just graduate are kicked out from America immediately, it violate all inclusiveness. Who will respect a country which shows less respect to international students? Besides, the reason why we came to USA to finsh our degree is good University and good internship. Most of us never think of competition with American people, what we need is working skill from internship in order to take off quick and have good career when we back to our own country. Otherwise, there will be less value to study abroad here. So this 24 months OPT is meaningful for both America and international students.
