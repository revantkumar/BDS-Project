The research, development, testing, and other projects commonly undertaken in STEM fields lasts for a few years. For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) typically funds projects through grants that last for up to three years. And in many fields such as mathematics, computer science, and the social sciences, NSF is the major source of federal funding. The STEM OPT extension would help the nation and its academic institutions remain competitive in light of global efforts offering international students longer post-study training experience without restrictions on the type of work that may be performed. 

These research activities will advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. The proposed rule would significantly enhance the academic benefit of a STEM student's OPT experience. 

In addition to the above benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.
