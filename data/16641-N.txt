I feel that it is unfair to prospective U.S. STEM employees/students to increase the time allowed for foreign OPT eligible students to receive On-The-Job training with U.S. employers. I do feel that the current program is being exploited by the mega-technology corporations in the U.S. by letting them hire/train foreign students at lower wages while at the same time saving money by not having to pay some taxes or other typical payroll benefits due to the students not being U.S. citizens. It is a disservice to the competing U.S. citizen. We must take care of our own first. I do feel that more oversight must be given to the current program. I do not feel that the current program should cost the government any money or loss of revenue but should be totally paid for by the companies that think they can't find enough workers that are citizens. If the companies need more workers, let them pay for their own training programs for U.S. citizens. U.S. taxpayers should not be responsible for training workers that will leave the U.S.. I do not feel it is fair to citizens to increase the number of H1B visas when we still have so many citizens that are not employed to their full capacity and paying their share of taxes and Social Security.
