Sha Fu I strongly support the proposal. 
First, from the long term prospective this policy is really beneficial for the development of the United States. Some people reject the OPT extension since they think the international students take the job opportunities from the citizens by accepting lower wages for just staying here. I highly doubt that opinion since, first, even with the OPT extension most of the companies still highly prefer to hire the American citizen. If the company need to sponsor H1B visa to a international student they need to first prove that there this no appropriate US citizen applied for that position. We cannot deny that the OPT extension may bring a little bit competition to the citizen in STEM majors, but please remember, the competition from international students is not a bad thing for the US students. If there is no competition, there is no growth and development.
Also, most of the STEM majors are most highly science and technical based. On those aspects the United States need the contributions from the talented people all over the world. Right now the US is facing severe competitions from other developed and also some developing countries, if the citizens in the US don't even want to work against a little bit competition from the international students how the US can maintain its leading position in technology over other countries? A great number of the international students are well educated people with Master or PhD degrees, there is no need to clarify that how much they have contributed to the development of the US. It is definitely the loss of the US to drive them away and let them to contribute to other countries rather than the US.
