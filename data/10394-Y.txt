STEM Extension is not enough, STEM Students should be given permanent residency, and eligibility criteria should be revised and it must depend on the credibility of the school and program. America is a land of immigrants and opportunities. A lot of people fear losing their jobs to foreign workers and students and it's because those people work for cheaper price. That's totally wrong perception. A business tries to save money as much as possible no matter who owns it and which countries it is in. if they don't find someone to work for them in that country at the price they want; they will outsource the job to a country where they can find cheap and skilled labor. If the jobs stay within the country of the business, money flows back into the same economy and creates more jobs in that country. It is not just because they are greedy, it is mandatory in this century, as small example will be the case of Apple. Do you think apple would have been able to compete with Samsung without moving most of its manufacturing and assembling units to china and without hiring foreign nationals in the US. US attract the best minds in the world, who have great dreams and a strong desire to achieve their dreams. It is not a good idea to let then leave the country and work on an outsourced job or compete with an American company.
