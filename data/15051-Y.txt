Brain Adnam I strongly support OPT STEM extension. I'm a US citizen. I worked for a high-tech company in bay area. Foreign students in STEM area are really really awesome in doing their job. They are creative, innovative and hardworking. I cannot imagine people like them smart have to leave. Perhaps we cannot hire enough people if only within US citizens. This is a smart move to keep STEM people here in the US.
