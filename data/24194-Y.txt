Seeing all those negative comments, I feel necessary to say something. First, as a working postdoc at Massachusetts General Hospital, I feel it's necessary to have an OPT status longer than a year. Since I plan to go back to my country afterwards, I am only using an OPT status to work as a postdoc. Publishing works and making meaningful progress normally take more than a year to accomplish. STEM would have given me a necessary time that I need to get my papers published. Second, from my experiences in the past years, many good researchers are people from Indian and China, who need STEM extensions as a necessary transit for their research career in the US. Without this period, many would have to go back to where they came, leaving good work and potential innovations unfinished. Third, United States is a country made by immigrants. The fact that most negative comments presents so much hatred to new immigrants only shows an impotence in competition for some of the people who made the comments. Rather than trying to work hard and improve themselves, they would rather target on future immigrants and eliminate any potential competition. This is not a great attitude, and certainly not a great one for the future development of the country either. Thus I express my full support for the new STEM proposal.
