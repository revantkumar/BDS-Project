Everyone are opposing this rule. Why? for sake of American workers? Then why are you giving visas for Alien people to come here, Study, Work and live? If there is not Alien worker in this country, will the US get this much income? Even top US branded companies using Alien branded companies to their complete projects, what it means? Why can't Americans do that job?

If this rule is implemented, Everyone will be benefited, even Americans too. Because Alien people will bring their money and invest here in terms on education, taxes, property, food. America is not developed by Americans, it is developed by everyone in the world with mutual understanding.
