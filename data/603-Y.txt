Markus Nelson I strongly support the proposal of extending the OPT for foreign students with STEM degrees. The benefits of this proposal are obvious:
1. The extension of the OPT will allow these STEM students to contribute more to the U.S. economy. For the graduates, it takes time to adjust to their new jobs and getting better at their jobs, especially in the field of sciences, since a project usually requires months or even years of effort. With only the initial 12-month period OPT, STEM students won't have enough time to accumulate their work experience and reach their full potential as employees. Therefore, with this extension, they can contribute more through research and innovation, and will in the long run help boost the U.S. economy and create more job opportunities.
2. The policy of extending the OPT will help universities in the U.S. to attract more students who want to study science from all over the world. The on-the-job training in the industry that follows after completing the degrees is one thing that makes studying in the U.S. so attractive. If the STEM OPT extension is eliminated, this will discourage more future students from coming to the U.S. to receive higher education. This will in turn have negative impact on the U.S. economy since foreign students pay higher tuition and their consumption makes big contribution to the GDP. According to the NAFSA official website, during the 2014-2015 academic year, 974,926 international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $30.5 billion and supported more than 373,000 jobs to the U.S. economy. 
Based on the above two reasons, I do support the STEM OPT extension.
