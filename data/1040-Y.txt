This rule is definitely good for not only international students but also American. As a first year master student in US, I found that course mates around me are quite outstanding and was surprised that so many excellent students chose to pursue degrees here. Actually, they had many choices to study in other countries' top universities, but US's open attitude and laws attract them most. Once this proposal is rejected, these outstanding students may no longer see US as their first choice and that is how US will lose great amounts of elites in many industries. 
I cannot even imagine how US would be like if this happens. Probably US's leading industries like IT and Finance will suffer the most. For American rather than these students, please pass this expanding proposal for STEM F1 students.
