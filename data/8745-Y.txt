SHIVA KRISHNA BURRA Dear DHS,
I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:
1. Extending STEM OPT time period attracts lots of more talented foreign students.
2. Students from foreign countries will pay double or triple the amount of fee to the U.S. Universities that being payed by U.S. residents and also students from other countries will use basic american facilities like Walmart, HEB, BEST BUY etc. which automatically will boost up the economy.
3. If you look at the overall IT market and Oil industries and U.S. Universities more than 25% of the talented workers are from foreign counties. So, the more the talented foreign students the more is the development.
4. Extending the STEM to 29 months in 2008 made more foreign students to come to United States to pursue their higher education there by give their own part in developing U.S. economy.
