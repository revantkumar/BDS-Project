I strongly feel that the STEM extension must be made valid for 2 years. The resulting OPT period of 3 years is a considerably long time for STEM Graduates to gain relevant experience in their field of study.

From a hiring standpoint, companies know they can hire and retain a candidate for a sufficiently long period of time for him or her to make a substantial contribution.

This extended period would also give graduated enough time to decide if they want to return to their native countries or file for a work permit here. Under the current system graduates are in a rush to file for a visa.

Ideally a longer OPT period of around 5 years will be greatly beneficial for those wishing to return to their home countries. They would have accumulated significant professional experience to have a headstart once they return. They would also have paid back the United States in terms of research or revenue for corporations based in the USA.
