Dear officer,

I highly appreciate the rule of "Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students". As the HR manager, it took me a lot of time to find talented scientists with the proper skill set to contribute to the R&D department developing new products on a tight schedule based on client request. The majority of the scientists are holding STEM OPT now. The failure of passing the rule will lead to MAJOR HR problems and immediately affect our timeline and revenue. 

Again, we cannot afford to lose these scientists and I'm looking forward to the effectiveness of the rule.
