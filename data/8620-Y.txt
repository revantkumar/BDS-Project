I SUPPORT the proposal of extending STEM OPT program for the following reasons:
1. The STEM OPT program is one of the reasons millions of international students come to US for higher education and work experience. This is a great program to attract students while one year may not be long enough to retain all the talents.
2. Many research and development project took more than a year. With the majority of tech research staff as international students, one year of work time is not enough for completing even one big project. If these workers are forced back to their home country, they will have the skills and knowledge to compete with US companies, not to mention that US companies need to spend money and recruit and train new workers at the same time. This is would be a bad impact for US economy.
3. Most OPT STEM workers earn significantly higher than US household median salary. Therefore, retaining these workers will not cause local Americans to lose job. The recruitment process for international student is usually much more complicated than hiring an American worker. Companies would like to go through this process is because they truly cannot find a competent American applicant for the job. And this phenomenon usually happens in the tech industry. With all the competition from China, Russia, India, and all over the world, US need to retain talents as many as possible for the sake of high-tech industry's fast development. You may never know that next Nobel price recipient might come from these once OPT workers.
4. With high average household income, STEM workers have great spending power and pay many taxes to support the American people and US government.
