Anna Hu Patricia David from JP Morgan, Global Head of Diversity, said,We think of diversity here at JPMorgan Chase as synonymous with talent. Its how we achieve our business objectives. When you hear these words, diversity, inclusion, etc., try replacing them with the word talent and youll understand what it means to us and what were trying to do. 

Diversity is really important for American businesses and economy, international students just need more time to show their talent in America.
