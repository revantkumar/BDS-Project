I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1, The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. university stay in the country and let them keep making contribute to U.S.

2, Diversity is very important for U.S., America need all the people from different counties to work together and contribute to the whole society.

3, Competition does exist, but from the point of long time, it is not a bad thing. We need intelligent people and hard-working people to stay in U.S. and made contribution to U.S.
