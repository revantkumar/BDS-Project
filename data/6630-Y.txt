Tina Wang I strongly support the proposal to give stem students a 24 month opt extension for the following three reasons:

1. International students are making huge contributions to our country. STEM fields are very critical for the US to continue its leadership in the world, while most of international students are working in scientific and technology fields, and many of them are among the best in their fields. The international students really do a great job on their position.

2. Rejecting international students may gain the US a illusive relief on the competition of the job market. However, this short-term satisfaction would be at the cost of long-term benefits of American people. Because STEM students have to go back to their country or go to other countries if they are rejected by the US. They will devote to scientific research, entrepreneurship, public policy and other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. At the same time, some startup US IT companies will loose large amount of experienced expertise staffs which cause great negative effect on their development.

3. International students' participation into job market would increase the competition. There is no doubt that more and more talented people are applying positions of big technology companies like Facebook and Google, which accelerates the development of theem. Such competition also makes US students works harder and harder, this will bring huge benefits to US society in the future.

In conclusion, closing the door is not a good way to preserve jobs and increase wages. It will only cause more outsourcing and destroy our tech industry, and then our economy. Open the door and welcome talents all over the world! We will gain far more than we lose.
