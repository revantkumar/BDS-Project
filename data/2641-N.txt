To give any foreigner without citizenship status a job and take work away from Americans is wrong! Americans come first - always! 
Foreigners are welcome as long as they go about citizenship LEGALLY. Government agencies should do not have permission to arbitrarily change laws already on the books. If that were the case, we could just fire most of Washington. Our congress is in place to enact the laws in the best interest of Americans.
