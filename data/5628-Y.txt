Fressia Feng I strongly support the extension policy. The OPT STEM extension policy has nothing to with stealing local US citizen's jobs, but provide US with continuous supply of young talented STEM graduates, which promotes the growth of science and technology in US. Besides, US needs skilled foreigners to fill certain job vacancies due to shortage of qualified workforce. As a result, I support this policy.
