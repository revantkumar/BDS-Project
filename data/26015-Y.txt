I would like to express my consent with the 24 months OPT proposal. This plan is going to be beneficial to outstanding students, as well as the companies, and even the US economy. 

Every year there are a number of outstanding STEM students who have to leave the US due to visa regulations. This is a disappointment for those who have an American dream. More importantly, the company is losing experts who work better but cannot stay. In the long run, the US will lose intelligent people because of the regulation. 

With the 24 months extension, students will be able to stay longer and have better chance to get H1B visa. This would be extremely helpful for those who contribute so much to the US. 

Thank you for your patience and respect to my comment.
