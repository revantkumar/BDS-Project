I strongly support this proposal.

1. Based on my experience, most large research and software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. After finishing the first design part, there are testing process and most projects need to be maintained by designer. If the designers or researchers need to leave US because of no OPT extension program, it would be disaster for the company or university who fund these projects or research.

2. There are 34,000 students in STEM OPT extension, which means 34,000 employees working and be responsible for their employers. Some might be in critical positions. They work hard, work legally, and pay tax on time. They trust this program since they may have considered the opportunities offered by STEM OPT extension when deciding whether to pursue their degree in the US. If suddenly they learn that STEM OPT extension is not legal, how can they balance this and how can their employer balance this?
