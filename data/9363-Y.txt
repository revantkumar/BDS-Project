Alyssa Baumgarten I am in favor of this new legislation because it will support students who have come here to learn and join the workforce in order to give back to the community. If they have a limited time here in the States, their opportunities to continue or finish their education and then serve in a job here are very limited. Specifically, a friend of mine has completed undergraduate studies but wants to continue to medical school and serve as a doctor here but cannot do that now on her limited visa. Please consider extending the time international students have here in order to allow them to continue pursuing their education and contribute to our communities and our nation.
