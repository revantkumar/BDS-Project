It is unjust, shortsighted and against the interest of American people to deprive international students' legal right to work in US after graduation simply because they are not citizens. In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students is also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out.
Therefore I suggest the new OPT rule should be improved by these steps:
1) very clear and high enough prevailing wage requirement for employers to recruit students on OPT.
2) set up a black list of companies that abuse OPT and H1b, those in black list will be forever barred from using OPT or H1b program.
