I support this extension of OPT period for F-1 non immigrant students with STEM degree. This is beneficial to students allowing them fully utilize the education they received after spending years for an advanced STEM degree. It is also a big step for the US to show it's generosity to offer it's world's best education to students all around the world and this extension of OPT can potentially attracts more students for universities, by promising a longer time for their career training after graduation. Leading companies like IT and high-tech companies can recruit the smartest people and best resources around the world and lead to continuous economy growth for the US.
