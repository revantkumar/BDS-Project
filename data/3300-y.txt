Anonymous I strongly support this rule.

The first thing I would like to address is international students won't harm American's job market; they will not take American's job. The employer prefers to hire American's first then international student. The employers will suffer from immigration policy as well. They are taking the risk that international student may force to go home after a few years. They need to sponsor international student's visa, which is a great cost. However, since there is a great shortage for STEM student, they have to do so.

Why America is the greatest country in the world? Diversity and opportunity. America knows how to attract the best talent in the world into itself. You can find the people from all over the world in an office. My manager is a German. I also know some guy from Italy, Poland, Canada and everybody in the world. 

Please pass this rule. This will great benefit US economy and diversity.
