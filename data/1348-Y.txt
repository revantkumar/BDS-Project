I am supporting new OPT extension. As a student who studies in the US in the field of STEM degrees, I came to seek for better education and more opportunity. Although universities in the US are very friendly to international students, as soon as we walk out of school we face the harsh reality of uncertain status. We want to help the US industries with the knowledge we learned here in the US but employers tend to prefer to hire a student with certain statuses such as Permanent residents or citizens. If that's not the case then they want to hire a person with extensive experiences which students just got out of college barely have. With the new OPT extension, we can get much better opportunities as US government ensure our status in theUS. Some might say why don't we go back and get experience in our home countries, however, it is even more difficult to get an immigrant working visa. Additionally, some of our countries don't have such an industries like the US does. Hollywood and its VFX studios are a good example. The new OPT extension will be beneficial for both US economy and students who hope to be a proud participant of its industries.
