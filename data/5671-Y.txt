This comment make me feel like this guy does misunderstand one point, like many other people may also do: the OPT program does NOT place foreign persons over US Citizens, but only provide foreign students equal and fair opportunities to compete in the job-seeking pool. Such competition is necessary to keep the whole national economics healthy. 

Nowadays, there are way too many disqualified candidate attribute their failure in finding a job into a hating emotion toward "foreign people", sounding as "those non-citizen steal their job"; yet the truth may actually is they just simply screwed up their own interview due to their own lower performance compared to their foreign classmates.
