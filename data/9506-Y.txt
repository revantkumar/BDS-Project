I strongly support the 24 months OPT extension for STEM degrees. 

The requirements for high-level STEM jobs are different in nature compared to other industries. According to the employers, it usually takes at least 6 months to get the new-hirers on track. Even with OPT extensions, international students are not as competitive as US citizens in the job markets with everything else equal, because of the uncertainty involved with the H1B lottery and all those hassles dealing with immigrant documents afterwards. It is not uncommon to see job listings that explicitly says they are only looking for US citizens. As a result, foreign born students are not likely to steal positions from US citizens.

On the other hand, the training and practical experience provided by the extra 24 months could serve foreign labors better with starting their own business, especially in the IT and internet business. From my own experience, I have seen foreign born students, having US-trained skill sets and international state of mind, establish their start-ups that not only contribute to their American dreams but also to the economy. 

Foreign students stay in the US for further career development and more importantly to contribute, not just to merely "stay" in the states at all costs. I don't see why the government want to be so stringent to those who work hard but so generous to those who live on subsidies. 

In summary, OPT extension won't hurt the job opportunities for the citizens but provide chances for foreign talents in the STEM fields to contribute to economy.
