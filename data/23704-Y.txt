I am so pleased to witness U.S government effort on putting forward the meaningful STEM OPT extension. This is a very positive sign to show U.S government realized the significance of the potential fortune stem students can bring to U.S. It is the most worthwhile congress proposal in 2015. Compared to those illegal immigration protection proposals, STEM opt extension can bring more active and bright hope to the downturn US economy. STEM students should have more chances to stay in U.S., compared to those numerous illegal immigrants in U.S. In other words, reversing U.S shrinking economy heavily depends on stem talents.
