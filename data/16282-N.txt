I believe it is time for America to Hire Americans first. Hiring foreign students is just another slap in the American peoples face!!
We need the jobs for our country's economy and we already give enough away to foreigners!! Our students are struggling to find
work and this would give tech companies incentive not to hire American college graduates!! They usually never pay minimum wage
or the employee taxes!! This should not be allowed to expand to 3 years or at all!!
