This OPT program is so bad I don't know where to start. Why are American's exempt from this program? We don't even need this program. There are too many foreigners taking American jobs. This will supplement the H-B1 program which is abused. I know new graduates that can't find a job in their field. They have student loans due and their jobs are given to people who aren't Americans. However, these aliens are young, cheap, and employers don't have to pay social security. It is costing the taxpayer money, Social Security money, students money when they can't pay their student loans back. There is absolutely shortage of STEM workers that are American. This OPT program is a bad idea.
