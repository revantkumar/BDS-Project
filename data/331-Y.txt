Cynthia Linton I strongly disagree new 24 month STEM OPT rule. The extension does no good but harm to the labor market in the United States. First of all, many companies especially technology firms use this opportunity to fill job opening with low-pay international students. Take the company I currently work for example, they fired a US citizen with many years of experience and replaced him with an international student fresh out of school for the reason that company intends to lower the pay as much as they can (lower than minimal wage). Secondly, I don't see the correlation between training opportunities and the extension. How much a STEM F1 student can contribute to US economy or gain practical training should be based on the quality instead of the quantity. Extending 17 months to 24 months doesn't solve any problems in US economy and labor market. The problems that 17-month opt brings will still remain the same even though we change it to 24-month opt.
