Sreekar Reddy Anugu I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed 24 Months STEM OPT Extension rule.I love contributing to Innovation and American Economy. I love the proposed STEM OPT Extension Rule. I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.

The international students you see here, especially from my country are some of the best. Because a few people are mediocre, doesn't mean every international student is mediocre.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
