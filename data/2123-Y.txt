I strongly support the new rule of OPT extension because it is a win-win for both parties. It is good for companies to hire foreign employees without the need to deal with the complicated paperwork of H1b, and for international students, before leaving US, they can gain the working experiences and apply what they have learned in American educational institutions to make contributions to American society.
