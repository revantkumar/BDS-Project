I agree with the STEM opt extension.
We both now that United States is an immigration country. It tolerant most people coming from foreign country. The development of American society, technology and science can never leave without the contributition of the foreign people , some of them finally settle down in America and become a U.S citizen.
The attitude treating foreign people, especially foreign students coming from STEM area, is the reason attract so many people coming from other country to U.S and make their contribution. If this extension is invalid, it will significantly hurt the feeling of them and finally cause these people moving towards to other country. In STEM area, this is big loss.
