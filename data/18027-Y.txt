I totally support the proposal of OPT extension for STEM stedents because they are all paying their efforts to America, more generally speaking, to the whole world. Besides, America is a democratic coutry which supports people from all over the world to pursue their Ameirican Dreams. Everyone should be endowed by enough rights to chase their dreams, not to mention they can do conspicuous contributions to the American
society!
