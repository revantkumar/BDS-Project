Dear Sir/Madam,

I strongly favour the rule to extend the OPT period for students in STEM 
areas, as not doing so will not only hemorrhage jobs from the US high tech 
industry but also wreck havoc on our higher education system.

Anywhere from 30-60% of students in our Reseach universities (those granting 
PhDs) are international students on F1 visas . They contribute to the 
educational endeavors in our universities by working as Teaching and Research 
Assistants, thereby contributing to the cutting edge research being performed in 
our universities, as well as by preparing the next crop of talented students from the 
general American student population who are studying as under graduates.

One of the motivations for these students to work and study in our universities is 
that once they are done with their education, they find it easy to contribute in the 
US high technology industry and participate in a contest of ideas and hard work. If 
this motivation does not remain valid, these students will no longer find it feasible 
to come to the US on student visas, that force them to leave and work in countries 
that are competing with the US for technology jobs. If will be much easier for them 
to enroll directly in foreign universities in countries with more favorable immigration policies such as Australia, UK, New Zealand, India, China and the EU nations.

This will deprive our universities and high tech industry of human resources at a 
time when such technologically qualified man/woman power increasing decides 
the state of a nations economy.

Thanks for consideration.
