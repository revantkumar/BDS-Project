I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1. One of the reason why I chose USA instead of Uk to continue furthure study was that the OPT program can help us to gain more industry experience. So this proposal can attract more OUTSTANDING international students for America education.
2. Diversity is very important for the USA.
3. Competition exists everywhere. It's not a bad thing. Actually, it can greatly IMPOROVE the progress of whole society. The rumor that international students hold low pay to grad job opportunities of native Americans is TOTALLY WRONG! Competition can help to select more oustanding employees. In this way, it can help to raise levels of both internation and american students. Further more, it helps to increase global competition power of USA.
