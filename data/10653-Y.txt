Requesting that the government considers expanding the H-1B visa opportunities for students of good-standing that are already employed in US companies.

It is really heartbreaking when such students have to reshuffle their plans and goals almost a year into their jobs because of the lack of a H-1B visa.

Many of these smart, talented and hard-working students give everything they can to not only contribute to the building of the American economy, but also to support their families and dependents. It is only fair to reward such diligence and selflessness with the opportunity to stay in the country and work to better the nation and self.

Please consider this request.

Thanks
