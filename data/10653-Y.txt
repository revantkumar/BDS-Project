YIQI DONG United States is a country that always proud of importing those foreign highly skilled employees to build the better country and world. An article in 2015 illustrates the benefits that highly skilled foreign workers can bring to the companies in US, including wage growth was substantial for people who worked for a company that included H-1B professionals; the wage increases in H-1B STEM workers were directly related to the increased wages that occurred within native U.S. workers with college educations; H-1B STEM wage increases directly affected wage increases for U.S.educated workers with both STEM and non-STEM jobs. Other articles also listed the benefits that the highly skilled foreign worker can bring to U.S., such as overall job creation, economy boost, and fees, taxes contribution to the country, and so on.

The advatnages those foreign workers had brought to the country can not be denied and overlooked. However, the regulations of limiting the importing process for those workers are building step by step. If U.S. government is following a path those anti-immigrant groups set up for, and eliminate the OPT or H1B privilege to those highly educated foreign students and workers, not only U.S. will see the downhill of its economy again, but also will lose its proud honor of willing to accept the most talented people around the world.

I believe U.S. is a country that has the most respect to diligent and smart people, but it needs to be realized by keep accepting them, but not ruling them out.
