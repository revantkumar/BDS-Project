Pamela Garcia To The Department of Homeland Security:
Your Department name is an oxymoron in that you do not help American Citizens, you are helping foreign students. Members of my family were 
not allowed to go to the college of their choice, not because of their 
grades, but because of what the Department of 'Homeland' Security has 
done, and is doing.

Most Americans are very aware that this Administration is following the
"Alinsky" model of "C-H-A-O-S," which he originally dedicated to Lucifer, 
"The first one to turn against GOD". You may not personally be aware of 
this dedication to Lucifer, (they have since removed the dedication with 
the newer printing of Alinsky's Rules for Revolution) but it is true. 
This is the model that this Administration wants used in every area of government. 

Please do not go forward with this proposal - we, the Taxpaying Americans, are barely hanging on out here. At least give our American children first consideration.
I appreciate your consideration.
