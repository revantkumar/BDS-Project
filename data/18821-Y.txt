Obviously, working hard does pay the same for every one. This rule should be true, especially in the US. What is freedom? What is American spirit? Why treat immigrates as inferior? Do you still remember that 200 years ago it is the immigrate that creates this nation which has became the greatest country in the world. OK, now you hate immigrates, just because they want to extent their OPT. Do you think this would make some people lose their job? I hardly think so. The stronger man would always find a job and create his/her own thing, no matter exterior environment. The immigrates just create such a great environment to everybody. Blocking immigrates from job market is a stupid choice, which only make the job market lose talent and decreasing the development of the whole country
