I am strongly for the passage of this new OPT extension rule. I have gone through tons of irrational opposing comments posted here and I don't see much concrete fact. OPT students do not mean cheap labor, they are undertaking high tech job with demanding responsibilities that company would have gone for native american job applicants had they meet both the quality standard and quantity. A simple fact is that OPT students do not receive under payment, they are usually more expensive to hire for a company when you consider the risk of losing these employees as they will be deported if they can not sustain their visa.
