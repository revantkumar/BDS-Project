Dahong Liu This is a very important strategic plan for the US. It opens doors to high quality students and scholars to contribute to the US society and economy. In contrast to illegal immigration, it's very beneficial at least for the following reasons. In short-term, international students, most of whom are from relatively wealthy families all over the world, can greatly stimulate the economy directly just by simply spending their money on education, foods, housing and etc. In the long run, many of these students can bring innovative ideas and solutions to the companies in US. That helps the country to be competitive. Meanwhile, it also helps to make the labor market competitive so that it's cheaper to employ a great talent.
I vote YES for this extension.
