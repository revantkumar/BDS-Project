Obviously, there are group of guys who want to win the competition by expel other competitors away rather than by their own ability. If giving opportunity to foreigners means to grab work opportunity from local residents' hand, how do we treat behavior of companys in their oversea market? Are they grabbing market revenue from other countries? It is competition, it is survival of the fittest, it is theme of the age to open chance for fair competition. It would be a regress to escape competition by policy method. So, it is not reasonable to against extension of optional practical training before United States quiting World Trade Organization to stop "grabbing" revenue from other countries.
