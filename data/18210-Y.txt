As an international student, I strongly uphold the OPT extension. 24 month OPT extension is win-win action for both international students and the United States.

OPT and its original extension for STEM major are one of the most essential policy that attracts me to apply graduate school in US. At the time when I applied graduate school, I also considered schools in UK. There are some of the world best universities in UK and most of them are one-year program. If I just want to attend a prestigious school, get an Master degree and then go back to my country to find a job, why don't I choose schools in UK? Apparently, OPT gives me an option to work in US and it's extension can guarantee me to legally stay in US until I get an H1-B visa. The work experience in US makes me more competitive candidate in job hunting back in my country. That's why I would rather to choose graduate schools in US even though it is more expensive and it requires more years to complete. It costs me more than 100k dollar to finish my degree(including tuition fee, housing, food and any other consumption). If it was not because of OPT and its extension, I would definitely choose schools in other country such as UK, Japan or Australia. I will also not recommend my friends and cousins to go to schools in US. I don't care about the location the school is in as long as it offers quality education(if I go back to my country as soon as I graduate). Why spending more money and more time to go to a school for nothing extra? It's not wise. Think about it. If the extension is canceled, thousands of students like me will choose other countries for further study, which means more cash will go to other countries. Schools in US will earn less, which may cause many actions(like rising tuition fee for locals). If there is 24-month extension for STEM students, schools in US still have the most competitive policy against other countries and US will still be the first choice for us.
