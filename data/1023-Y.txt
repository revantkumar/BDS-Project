This Proposed Rule, expanding OPT periods means so much to both the US workforce and the international students. There are thousands of international students who are using OPT right now, and a lot of times they leverage OPT to work full-time before they can get a H1B visa in April every year.These people are very talented people coming from their own country and seeking an opportunity to apply what they learn in the States, right here. 

Needless to say how many immigrants has made contribution the States, let's think about the JOB OPPORTUNITIES these people have brought. It is already a number that is at least ten times of the population of these students. The good effects are way more prominent than the so-called drawbacks, since such "drawback" are drawn with a limitation of either knowledge or even worse, prejudice. 

Please don't let the narrow vision have a chance to harm the American economy, especially when it looks great now.
