I do strongly agree with the 24-month extension of OPT. I think it will benefit much more for the US.

International students earn more than half of advanced STEM degrees in the U.S. http://college.usatoday.com/2015/07/08/international-students-stem-degrees/. Image how much will it cost to replace those highly technical workers. Companies need to constantly plan for new hires as they leave only after one year! What can they bring in the first year? I would guess it's more about what they can learn. Which company wants to hire someone to provide some orientations, some trainings, and let them walk away with all those knowledge? 

The direct reaction for companies will be stopping hiring international students. But where to find replacements? Half of advanced STEM degree earners are international students. Companies will definitely experience a head shortage and lack of talents, which will hurt the economy in turn.

On the other hand, US will less attractive for international students as they know they will leave after one year at way, especially when other nations are trying the best to get those students. US colleges count on its students to spread out the impact. State universities look for fundings from international students, and even retailers are depending on them for extra boosts.
