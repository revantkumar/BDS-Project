Dear Mr. Johnson:

I am writing regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule-making on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. Initially when district court vacated the STEM Extension, I came to know the situation of US workers. I felt guilty that we, international students grabbing the opportunities from US workers. I do not want to destroy the life of a citizen in a country where I developed my skills which is globally recognized. Now I can live anywhere with this knowledge and skills. 

But I was shocked when I read basis for this rule. For ex. DHS Mentioned that " The research has found that a one percentage-point increase in immigrant college graduates' population share increases patents per capita by 9 to 18 percent " in the Rule-making. I am not either supporting or opposing but I request you to make a decision which satisfy both international students and US workers.
