This new proposal of OPT extension is highly welcomed by me and all my friends with OPT status, as well as all the tech firms in this country. From one hand, we have opportunity to apply our knowledge and skills that we learned/practiced in our training at school, and contribute to the growing of firms and the whole industry; From the other hand, the economy development of the US has always been driving by technology, from WWII, to now, and to the future. The prosperity of the country needs an increasing amount of graduates with high-tech background. Some people argues that this might a threat to US citizens with STEM backgrounds. However, those highly biased and shortsighted people will never understand how hard the tech firms are finding the STEM graduates for company growth. The more series thing is, in my perspective, the xenophobic prejudice from those people, has been a threat to the soul of this country. Therefore, this proposal of OPT extension for STEM graduates is, not only well justified, but also keenly needed.
