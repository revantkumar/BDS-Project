I agree with the expansion of training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees.

The society needs more great technical staff in STEM fields, this will push the development of America. If some American say it reduces their working opportunities, I think it is ridiculous. Companies are smart enough to choose who they need. If someone is not suitable in doing jobs in STEM, how can they say F-1 students grab their jobs. Opportunities are left for people who can do it, but not only for national citizens.
