The following is some points that support OPT Stem.

The advantage is OPT Stem is it can make use of useful international students while it is only a short temporary period that those foreigners can stay in US. And since more and more international people flow into states for further education, technology companies have infinite intelligent resource annually. They dont have to worry about lack of special technical workers because once those people use up the OPT Stem, a new bunch of internal students come in US.

As a result, THE OPT STEM is kind of a strategy to keep those intelligence in states while not let them stay long in US.
