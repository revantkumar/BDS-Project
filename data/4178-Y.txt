I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. 
The reason why the economy, science and technology of America developed rapidly within hundreds of years is that the United States respects talents, no matter he/she is a citizen or not. No one can deny that many skilled immigrants have made tremendous contributions in the science and technology innovations. The creative innovation can only be fulfilled with diversity. Even worse, if the proposal did not get approval, it will greatly reduce the number of prospective international students, which will hit the education industry of America.
