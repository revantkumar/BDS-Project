US is a country established by immigrants.

Without the talents and efforts of generations of immigrants, US can not be as powerful as it is today.

The competition among powerful countries today is at its core a competition about who can retain talents.

Do you really want to drive away those highly-educated new Americans who can make this country stronger and generate more job openings, just because they occupy a small fraction of the total jobs?

Think about what makes America as powerful as it is today!
