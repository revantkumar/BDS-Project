Companies don't want to hire Americans and they abuse {H-1B} and OPT to hire cheap immobile labor instead of hiring anyone over the age of 35, especially in software or tech areas.

Let's stop pandering to immigrants and make these jobs available to Americans. There is no reason to give employers any incentive to hire foreign workers and place Americans and LEGAL immigrants at a disadvantage. 

This regulation leaves the US worker unprotected because by definition there are no similarly situated US workers. So employers therefore have an excuse and an alibi to replace all US workers with imported foreigners.
