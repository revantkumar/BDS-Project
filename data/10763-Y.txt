I don't know why there are so many people against this proposal. Think about it, if you only give F-1 students 1 year for opt, they will mostly not get the H1B visa, which means they will come back to their hometown after 1 year. These years more and more International students study in USA not only for the high education quality but also want to stay in USA at least work for several years to earn the tuition fee back. For most of the International students, study in USA is like an investment. If they only have 1 year working in USA, most of them will not get the investment money back! It will certainly stops many students who are planning to come USA!!!
I STRONGLY SUPPORT the proposal. International students can get a higher quality of education which can improve their abilities, and on the other side, they can promote the economic benefit of USA. What a win - win game!!!
