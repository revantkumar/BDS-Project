I am retired but the following facts aboutthe Optional Practical Training Program (OPT) have come to my attention and leave me greatly disturbed:

1) OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013.
************** This is unacceptable: I have friends and know children of friends who cannot get jobs in their own country in the fields they worked and studied hard for. 

2) OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.
**************This outrageous!!!!

3) The original purpose of Optional Practical Training was to give foreign students extra tools to help their home countries when they returned but today it is more often used by foreign students as a bridge to stay in the U.S., and by employers to get around the H-1B cap. DHS' proposed rule runs counter to the original purpose of the OPT program.

4) There are approximately 568,000 F-1 students in the U.S. in addition to 98,000 in 12-month OPT programs and 30,000 in 29-month OPT programs. Giving employers incentive to hire ! from this giant pool of workers undermines the job opportunities for American STEM workers.

5) OPTs are sought after by employers because they tend to be younger (cheaper) than their American competitors. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year.

Big Business should not be supported like this at the expense of U.S. citizens.

I would expect a thorough and objective, non partisan review of the OPT program with full support and protection of U.S. citizens' jobs and future safety nets like Social Security and Medicare.
