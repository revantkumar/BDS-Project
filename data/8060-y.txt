shrihari rajendranradhika I support the proposed OPT STEM extension rule. Us international students need solid work experience to further our career in our fields. Without this proposed rule all of us will have limited to no work experience after graduation.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000s of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy.
