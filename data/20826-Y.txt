Indeed let international students stay longer in America may touch someone's job , but don't forget they are adding an extra huge market to American industry, which created a large number of work opportunities. Somebody only notice International students are taking away American's job and that's ture, but actually they also creating job for both themselves and Americans. Many Chinese restaurants hire American employees. If they can't stay too long in America, many those Chinese restaurants will not exist and no longer provide job for Americans. So, what I'm saying is we shouldn't only take the bad effect for prolong the OPT into consideration, ignoring the benefits they bringing to us is not America spirit.
