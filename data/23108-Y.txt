I support the OPT extension policy. Some american citizens were worried about the foreign immigrants are taking over their job positions, however, even with the OPT extension policy, an international student still need to obtain H1B visa for work after the OPT period, and the number of H1B visa does NOT increase each year, so finally the number of foreign worker does NOT increase with the approval of OPT extension policy and the american citizens' job will not be reduced.
