I strongly support the proposed rule. 

Both technology companies and STEM students will benefit a lot from the approval of it. Many nonimmigrant students take STEM as their major and seek job opportunities in tech companies after graduation. It takes time to train fresh graduates into experienced ones to suit the job and extended OPT will minimize the time spent on training and maximize the benefits for tech companies, and hence more easily create a sense of consistency and loyalty among nonimmigrant employees. This does good to the U.S. economy. 

Also, competing environment in the job market may stimulate and encourage everyone in it to work for the better. And people from diverse background can contribute their wisdom from potentially very different angles. So keeping those brilliant F-1 students in STEM working in the U.S. for a few more months may not be a bad thing, especially in the long run.
