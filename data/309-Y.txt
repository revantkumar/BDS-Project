Raymond Mack As a professor, I have to stand out to support OPT extension. Afte I reviewed some comment, I noticed that some opposite opinions believes that international students wastes taxes and may compete with local workers. 
I have to say that this kind of worries isn't making sense. My university is an engineering university in the east coast. We admitted lots of international graduate students. When they study, most of then are sponsored by their family. They rent rooms and here, eat in restaurants near the university and pay retail taxes. After they graduate, only who major in computer science or master on programming could find a job here. 
Companies always pay very high salary to them (more than $80000 a year). Companies also need to pay thousands of dollars on sponsorship. They also have to risk that their foreign employer couldn't get ah H1B visa to continue their work. 
Why companies willing to pay more to recruit a foreign student other than recruit locals? The simple reason is there is no enough locals have the skills tech industry desired. 
I always doubt that if no foreign student in U.S. tech industry, how could Facebook or Amazon appeared in here other than India or China?
