I have opposed all previous legislation to increase the importation of cheap foreign labor. These efforts by lobbyists have been crippling American workers for over three decades. My children have not been able to find and keep jobs at minimum wage. Employers limit workers to 20 hours per week. Rotating schedules do not allow people to take secondary jobs. The American people have rejected these efforts for 30 years. When Congress does not enact more slave labor, then the Administration enacts with executive order. "New jobs" may approach 100,000 in a good month, but new claims for unemployment compensation exceed 300,000 per WEEK. Tens of millions of Americans are still without jobs since 2008 and are hidden from labor statistics. Congress supports moving more US industries overseas (TPP and Free Trade Aggreements). 

The F-1 OPT program offers employers $10,000 bonus for hiring a foreign student instead of an American citizen. 

Employers of F-1 OPT are exempt from payroll taxes. 

How can a citizen compete?

Please oppose increases or extensions to H-1B, H-2B, and F-1 OPT. There is a long history of fraud and abuse in these visa programs.
