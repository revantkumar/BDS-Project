I support OPT extension because the US government should grant fairness to the normal and honest US graduates by at least giving them the authorization to work after graduation. Right now the H1B cap is reached every year and it is increasingly difficult to get one. I heard rumors that this is mostly because of frauds submitting duplicate H1B applications directly from Asian countries. If the government is incapable of catching those frauds, at least they can give the honest US graduates a chance to work by extending the OPT.
