I was a high tech worker working along side a lot of H-1B visas worker. Some of these H-1B visas people could not speak English or do the work and we were on a government contract. What is wrong with this? Why were not Americans doing the job. Because the H1-B worker and my self (a woman) worked cheaper. I know a lot of people who need to work but they can not because they speak English or do not come from the right town/country over seas.
