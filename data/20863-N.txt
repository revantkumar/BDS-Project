I oppose expanding the Optional Practical Training rule proposal by the Dept of Homeland Security. If passed this rule would allow US companies to hire foreign students and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes. It also violates the US Visa law that states that foreign students leave the country after completing their degree. We do not want to hire foreign students over qualified US students who are trying to enter the US workforce.
