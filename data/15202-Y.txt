As an F1 student,it's really helpful to expand training opportunity since it's a great chance for us to sharpen what we have learned from school. There's a big difference between what you learned at school and what you gained from real industry. I believe it will help me contribute more when I came back to my own country. Also, expanding the opportunities will attract more students to come to America for further study, which in turn contribute the improvement of whole society.
