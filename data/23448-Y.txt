I strongly SUPPORT the proposal. The government should let the students who studied and graduted from U.S. universities have a chance to stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the countries. Diversity is very important for the U.S.. Before becoming a figure in a specific area, many excellent persons were international student and needed the OPT extension. Competition sometimes a good thing to inspire both the US students and international ones.
