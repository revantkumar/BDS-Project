I fully agree with the OPT new STEM rule, actually I think in the future OPT extension shall be extended to some non-STEM graduates as well. 
The last time I was a student was 15 years ago. 15 years ago with a beer at hand I could type thousands of words without a single break. Now I need to remember what I want to say just minutes ago, and can't make even one more line of shit. OK, my point is, if you don't allow them work and contribute here, then which country you think they will work for.
