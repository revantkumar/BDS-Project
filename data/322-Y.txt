To whom may concern,

I strongly agree on this new rule, because it's beneficial to the economy of the United States, the employers as well as the non-immigrant students. 
Firstly, the expanding training opportunities attract millions of highly educated students to the United States every year to get further industrial experience. These STEM students have been contributing to the development of technology, science and finance in the past years. Besides, the money they spent for their daily life, entertainment and work has also been a great stimulate to the grocery, tourism and so on. What's more, the tuition from international students is now major income of lots of universities and colleges, thus reduce our own cost in education. 
Finally, these training opportunities help to reduce the human resource cost for the employers. Therefore, the employers can get better talents with lower price, to grow their business.
This is why I think this rule benefits the United States and therefore it should be admitted.
