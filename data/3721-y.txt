Naiyi Li Dear Office of the Federal Register,

I highly recommend to keep OPT STEM extension. I was in engineering school and my major is chemical engineering, I am now working in engineering field for a while. I know a lot of people from mechanical engineering, industrial engineering and civil engineering. All this engineering related field and companies need a majority workforce of international graduates, both long term and short term. OPT STEM is absolutely needed for short terms, and a good transfer period for long term H1-B application. Also, OPT STEM is a good way for the internationals who only want short term working experiences in the U.S.A. For companies needed money to support H1-B for their employees, and nowadays, companies would like to hire more people with OPT STEM for their short term projects. Therefore, I highly suggest we keep the OPT STEM or even make it longer for this great tech and engineering era. OPT STEM is definitely a good tool to help the technology development of U.S.A. 

Yours sincerely, 
Naiyi
