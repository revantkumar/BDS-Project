I totally ageed with the extension of OPT,international students spend higher tuition fees on their degrees than natives do,they deserve enough time to get more work experiences and skills in the US,which can make them competitive after coming back to their country,they never mean to contend with natives,plus,as the most powerful country in the world,it is responsible for US to help students from developing country by doing so__expanding the time for OPT.
