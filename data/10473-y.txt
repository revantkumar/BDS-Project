Shu Zhou I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension.My husband is a F1 student. He works as a TA in thechemistry department of OU.His wage is $17,000 after tax. In order to support his study, I quitted my job in China and becamea stay-at-home mom to take care of my family. The rentof our apartment is $900 permouth. My daughter's preschool tuition is $600 permouth. Based on the two expenses,my husband's wage couldn't support the whole family's expenditure. We have used our savingthat we earned inChina to support our spending in the US. Besides, both of our parents came to the US every year to visit us. Theytraveled with us to lots of places in the US. We also wentback to China every a fewyears. These are large expenses in the US. We live here and we spend money. I have to say we are making a nice contribution to the US economy. The opt-extension is good for us as well asfor the US economy. That is a win-win situation! I dont understand why there are some people don't like it
