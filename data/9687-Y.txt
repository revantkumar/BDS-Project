Every intellectually capable person knows the US is an immigrant country and the advances rely heavily on those technicians/professors who used to be F-1 students. See how many talented people in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street are originally F-1 students and think about how much contribution these two areas make to the US economy and technology. The students don't get working opportunities for free. They have to learn much harder than citizens and become "more eligible" in order to convince the employers they are a better fit. As far as I see those citizens who study hard always easily get jobs because they have more advantages in recruiting events in comparison with the F-1s. However, unlike citizens, those F-1s who don't study will never get jobs. So why would you refuse to award those who study really hard just to make the government create more working opportunities for you so that you can keep partying and failing the courses while still getting jobs? This is capitalism, only those who are willing to work get paid and this is why the most talented people are driven by a desire to come here. If you want the country to advance, just embrace those talented F-1 students to give them opportunities to change the way you live in a positive way; otherwise, go back to study so that you are not eliminated while the students sent home by you because they have no chance to stay here are quickly pushing the world forward.
