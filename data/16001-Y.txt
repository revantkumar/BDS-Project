Extended OPT is essential for students receiving training in basic science. For instance, postdoctoral training in life science usually takes >3yrs, especially for those pursuing career in academia or R&D, regardless of nationality. Foreign student have significantly less opportunities for independent fellowship, yet labs still hire them using their own lab funding. The reason is partly that the number of qualified US nationals for that kind of job hardly meet the demand. By banning STEM extension the government is bringing devastating consequences to the research field. Without regulatory support such as STEM opt, in the future there will be much less talents who will help advance science and technology, and the US will less likely to see people like Aziz Sancar (this years Nobel Laureate who wins honor for a US institution and who is a foreign national).
