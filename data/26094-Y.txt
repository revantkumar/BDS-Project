As a CTO of a startup company, I welcome this 24-month extension. Our company is a equal right hiring company. We hire people who can do the job. It seems that foreign STEM students are really smart and hardworking. We pay exactly the same as US citizens. If this rule didn't pass, I'm afraid we cannot hire enough people to make innovations. Those who are really smart and can make contributions to high-tech sectors deserve to stay.
