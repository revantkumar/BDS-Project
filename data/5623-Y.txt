Grace McKay What can you be thinking when not considering American graduates. Is it not time to consider Americans who have strived for what they might have and stop considering people who think there is something wrong with someone who is constantly giving hardworking people's money away to give to someone who has never given a nickel to help any one else out. There is something sick about what is going on in this country to it's citizens and non citizens are getting everything free and not contributing anything. Let's start thinking about what is the right thing to do for AMericans. Shame on you.
