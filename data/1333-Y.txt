I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1.The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S..

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. Many great people who help the U.S. to become better since they were international students. 

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. The international students don't take the job by ask for a low payment. However, it is just because the company can't find the U.S. citizen who fit the job. The competition can help the country to get the better person. Furthermore, the current situation is that there's no regulation towards those companies and H1B is base on a lottery system, which means those truly needed talents, hard working people may be forced to leave. Your suggestions of providing those people green card directly sounds awesome but is not practical at least in the near future. Without OPT I wonder how you are gonna keep those talents?
