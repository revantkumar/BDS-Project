Comments on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, 80 Fed. Reg. 63,376-404 (proposed Oct. 19, 2015).

4. The OPT program runs contrary to the purpose of non-immigrant student visas.

OPT is fundamentally in conflict with the purpose of student visas (admitting students) and the requirement that student visas be strictly non-immigrant. Congress has been explicit that student visas are not to be used as a means for immigration. It has been even more specific that work on student visas it not to be used to prepare for immigration. In reading through the comments made by foreign students, it was striking how many of them supported OPT as a vehicle to remain in the United States.
