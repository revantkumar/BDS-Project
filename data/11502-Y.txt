I am strongly agree with the new policy. And I have several reasons to support my opinion.

First, the hundreds of thousand of OPT students pay billions dollars tax per year. This is a huge income for the government. If U.S. loses them, the burden will be passed on U.S. citizens.

Second, most STEM students are engineers and scientists, so they are the accelerators of the domestic economy. Thanks to their hardworking, more job opportunities are created.

Third, companies need people. If they cannot find enough people, they will shut down. Then the industry will shrivel and more job will disappear.

Last and the most important, from the start, U.S. is a nation of immigrants. Generations of immigrants built this country. This spirit is the most precious thing for U.S. .
