I STRONGLY support this proposal. I have several reasons here. 

First, I am a graduate student here. I have been well-trained here for several years, if I could work here for several years, it obviously do good to the US economy. Otherwise, it is not worth for the the US since so much money and energy has been spent. Working here for several years is a good way to benefit the US. 

Second, the students majoring in STEMs are a great wealth to the society. We can help improve the the scientific and techniques improvement. The jobs we are doing are not simple jobs, which needs a lot of training and experiences. 

Third, to give everyone an equal chance is the truly American spirit. The talented students deserve to have more time to perfect themselves and thus benefit the society. If this cannot pass, many students have to go back to their home country. This brain loss will certainly do great harm to the US society. Also, this will discourage the international students to study here. 

Thank you!
