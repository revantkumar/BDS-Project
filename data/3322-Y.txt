I totally support this rule. I think this is good for both US citizens and International students.

Firstly, compared to universities in other countries such as UK, Japan, many international students choose American universities to attend because it has this OPT extension in the past years. We all know, the tuition and living costs are so expensive, and the huge amout of money will be good for US economy and also good for the research of university. So, I think OPT extension is very important for US universities to attract international students.

Secondly, competition is a good. Many US citizens complaint that OPT extension hinders them to find a job. But that's because they are afraid to compete with international students. Companise are very fair to hire everyone. The existence of OPT extension can make US citizens become more excellent. The country should let its people become more confident and outstanding , and the soceity should be more open.

Finally, If you cancel this rule , The biggest victims are those technology companies, especially those start-up companies. As far as I know, international students are the main force of many company's technology department, if they left because of not obtaining H1B visa, those companies may not even survive. The United States now have massive demand of high-tech talent people, and economic growth can be definitely slowed down by talents leaving. I think, students who come to the US are also top students in their home country. They obtain high education, and they use the best resources in the world. Now, they are willing to work for the US, I think you should cherish thoese talents.
