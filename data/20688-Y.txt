STEM extension should be approved. Otherwise US economy will get hurt badly. 

Many corporations in the US need the STEM majored employees, who needs the extension to stay in the US and work for the US. If the extension gets revoked, for one thing, hundreds of thousands of STEM majored employee will be forced to leave the country, for another thing, employers will be unwilling to hire STEM majored foreign students, which lead them with limited choices since most of them are foreign students.
