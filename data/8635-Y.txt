Divyesh Savaliya **STEM OPT Extension is MUST needed**

Here are the reasons i support STEM OPT Extensions,

*International Students who gets to study in the US universities should get a chance to prove them selves and should get a chance to work with US companies.

*Having this STEM OPT Extension is very important for US economy as well, the students are going to Contribute to the US Economy which is really important.

*Hi-Tech industry is one of the biggest driving force to the US economy. The Hi-Tech industry DO NEED enough work force to maintain the growth and contribute to the much needed innovations for the future of the company and the US economy as well. OPT STEM extension is a really really good way to provide this HIGHLY SKILLED workforce. 

*I think, for any country, having Highly skilled workforce is a big PLUS for the over all growth for the country. it is not easy for any country to keep getting HIGHLY SKILLED professionals. So, this proposal will make sure it happens.

*If this proposal(24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule) doesn't go through, this will dis-courage the future international students to come to US for their Higher studies.

I strongly support the proposed 24 months STEM OPT Extension Rule.
