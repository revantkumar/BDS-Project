I think it a great idea to extend the OPT for F1 students who opt to gain some practical training experience complementary to their studies. Those F1 students who manage to find employment post their studies are those best who master the language and learn the culture of this country, that they can be a good source of human capital of the economy. 

America is a strong country, and it has been made stronger by the fact that every year 3 millions of immigrants add to its population every year and many of those immigrants are well-educated young people. 

I strongly support this extension.
