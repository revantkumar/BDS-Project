This is definitely a very GOOD policy, both in terms of education community and industry: 
1. Students in STEM majors occupies a great percentage in the overall international students in U.S, However, if you tell them: just leave your tuition here and ZERO possibility for you to get a job and live here after graduation, what would happen? Will it gonna be the same amount of international students here? They embrace and CONTRIBUTE to the most advanced education in the world and merely want to get some industrial experience or just to have some transitional time before they come back home. 
2. What would happen if high tech companies(like Google, Yahoo, Facebook..) especially in computer science related areas have to lay off a majority of their senior employee tomorrow? It is unimaginable. In STEM fields, foreign employees here contribute a lot to American society. They help expand the industry, push forwards the technology frontier so that America keep a giant lead role in the world, and more importantly , they potentially create much more job opportunities for Americans than the amount they occupied.
