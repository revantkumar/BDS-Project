I just want to briefly mention that, only thinking about the benifit of United States, what will benifit this country if you just let the international students go back to their own country, especially those student who can get the STEM degree, those groups of student are highly educated and will contrubute to the US a lot in many ways in the future. Those people who strongly disagree with the STEM OPT are lazy people who are afraid of competition on doing a better job, they want to sit tight at a high pay job without fighting. Please think about if a country will improve itself by being lazy and trying to escape from competition.

Thanks.
