I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to theU.S. They are all smart students from all over the world.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, many famous scientist who gained the diploma from U.S has made big contribution to the U.S

3. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. It can motivate people working hard.
