The reason I choose to come to US is because the education here is excellent, the more important part is the STEM OPT that gives the industry experience. IF it is cancelled, I believe a lot of foreign students would choose other countries such as UK, Canada. It is a huge loss for US's education income, which is a great part of the universities's support.
