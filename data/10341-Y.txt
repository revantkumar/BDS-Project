I have seen no reason why OPT extension should be canceled or shortened!

We international students make a great contribution to U.S. tax revenue! We do a lot of shopping every year. We paid income tax legally. And most of us are youth independent with no child and other dependents. We pay higher tax than the average of U.S. residents! I paid more than 25% of my income every month!

If OPT extension is canceled, OK! let's see how much the government shall loss.
