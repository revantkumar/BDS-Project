I believe that the improving and expanding OPT would be really benefit for F-1 students, and I hope this regulation could be proved by Gov. There are several reasons why I consider that this regulation is good for F-1 students. First, there are more and more international students coming to the U.S for study, and many good students get the job offer after the graduation. However, students have to get H1b visa to continue working after the OPT expiration. And not all students who have job offer are able to get H1b as the number of h1b visa are limited. As a result, expanding the OPT would increase the chance to get H1B. Otherwise, those who have job offer have to leave the U.S. country. Second, expanding the OPT will give students more time to get experience in their related major after the graduation. Third, this regulation is also benefit for company who hire international students. When students who work in company in one or two years, they normally just get in used to what's really going on of the company. If they have to leave the company just because of working eligibility, the company has to hire new employees, which means that the company has to train the new employees again. All in all, this regulation should be proved.
