I strongly SUPPORT the proposal of a 24 month extension on the OPT !!! Someone said STEM student have to compete with foreign students who will accept the low wage, it's not true. Competition means progress, competition make everybody tries best to achieve their goal which make huge contribution to the whole American society. Everyone is hardworking not only Americans but also foreign students. Some companies choose foreign students not because foreign students will accept lower wages but they think these foreign students are more suitable for the job. Lots of company expect the diversity since their business is around the world. In order to make US become more powerful extend the OPT!
