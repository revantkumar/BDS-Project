I work in the IT industry.
I see nothing but abuse.
Our STEM graduates are ignored.
Less-qualified people are brought in to work for less money.
Why do we tell kids to go to college at all?
Too many Americans are out of work and more are getting fired every day.
Please stop issuing H1-B visas.
The program is totally out of control.
It's completely fraudulent to say that these visa's are being used for jobs that Americans can't do.
Nothing has destroyed information systems careers in this country more than cheap foreign labor.
The cheapening of this labor force has led to untold millions of dollars spent on IT projects that never work. 
I want to know what chance an American kid with a Computer Science degree has of finding a job.
