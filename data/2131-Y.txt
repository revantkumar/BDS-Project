I support the new OPT extension rule. Technology industry in US is developing more and more rapidly, and it needs more engineers work here. There are not many US students in STEM major, if all foreign graduates are banned from working, current number of US graduates in these majors may not fulfill the needs by technology companies. As for the concerns of OPT workers taking over native Americans' job, I do not think it matters because according to statistics, average salary of STEM graduates are supposed to be higher than US labors. If there are enough number of US graduates for opening jobs, companies would never hire any foreign graduates.
