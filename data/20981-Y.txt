I believe this would be a great act.
It is very beneficial for technology companies, as the majority of their employees are international student/graduated student that are under OPT. By extending the cap-gap, these employees have a greater chance to continue to work in the US hence making contribution to this country. The companies that hired these international employees could then put more resources on more important projects.
