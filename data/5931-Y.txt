I strongly support this rule for expanding the training opportunities for the F-1 students. The reason is two-fold:

1. The US economy can benefit a lot from the working of these international students who are well educated by the US education system. Many international students have received their Bachelor, Master or even Phd degrees from the top universities and they are well educated and trained in the US. They are smart, creative and dedicated. Many students (e.g., many Phd students) are even supported by the funding from NSF, NIH and so on. These money are actually from the US tax payers. Why do we ask such smart students leave immediately after they spend a lot of our money and make contributions to other countries? It is vital to let them keep making contributions to this country. Competition does exist, but it is not a bad thing. It can benefit the US's competition power in the long run. 

2. Many research projects cannot be finished within one year. I received the Phd from the US universities and I have participated various research projects supported by NSF during my Phd studies. Usually one research project will last for 2 or 3 years. So without the OPT extension, many important research projects cannot be finished, which may also ruin the US's core competition ability.
