Thank you for taking these quick steps to resolve this OPT issue.

It would be much more mutually profitable for all stake holders including students, universities and hiring companies to have extended the OPT beyond 24, i.e., upto 48 months. It would allow more time for prospective employers to decide if they want to file H1 visa for the candidate. It would also give much more time for students earn more and give them a good chance to return to their native countries. It will also decrease pressure on H1 visa applications, as students get more time, by 48 months they might want to return instead of staying for few more years by filing for H1.

If OPT extension is only for 24 months they are good chances for students preferring to stay back and file H1 instead of leaving to their ow countries. This might in turn effect opportunities for US citizens.

24 months is good , but not enough. Extending for 48 months might be a better idea.
