I am for the STEM OPT Extension because it is required to be able to provide a reasonable period of valuable work experience to International Students who have come to the USA to gain better education. It provides a fair ground for the International Students to be at par with US citizens, without providing any undue advantage to the International Students towards obtaining a job in the area that they have gained knowledge in.

There is a a lot of research being done by the International Students in the Universities at USA that adds to the technological advancement of the industry. As this research is being done within the country, USA is the first country to reap the benefits of this research.

In case this rule is revoked, it will discourage International Students to come to USA for education. This could lead to loss of potential research that the International Students could have added. Possibly, leading to a drop in the pace of technological revolution in the USA.
