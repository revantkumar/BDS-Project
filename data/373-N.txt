Our incredible immigration policies seem designed to depress wages at both ends of the spectrum. Tech companies that lay off workers while simultaneously lobbying for more training for foreigners are simply trying to depress wages. The flood of unskilled "workers" are mostly welfare bound. They keep the low end wages low...at the same time our idiot politicians are screaming for raising the minimum wage. The results are going to be catastrophic, a large class of citizens who will never work again, putting impossible burdens on the TAXPAYERS.
I think back to 30 years ago, I thought when the baby boomers retire in large numbers those younger American's will all have hi paying jobs, some immigration AS NEEDED, and inflation would gradually erode the wealth of the older generations.
Instead far too many young Americans have no future at all due to corporate greed and political malfeasance.
The open borders policies have to end if there is any chance of avoiding economic disaster. I think it unlikely.
