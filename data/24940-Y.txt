Regarding docket ICEB-2015-0002, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degress and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,

I object, I object, I object to the, in effect, expansion of the F1 "training" time span well beyond an H1-B on two grounds. 

First, I don't know why this is even being considered as those most in need of "relief" are our own citizen students. This does indeed adversely affect US citizen students employment opportunity, as I've personally witnessed this as an employee of Nortel Networks and Avici Systems.

Second, I in no way see this as with the domain of a bureau whose role is enforcement.

And lastly, as a web portal collecting comments, I hardly think it is reasonable to collect comments on policy from non-citizens, because they will not be suffering the repercussions of unemployed US citizens students.
