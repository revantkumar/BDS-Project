I am in strong favor of the proposed rule on improving and expanding OPT for F-1 students.

As a postdoctoral scholar ("postdoc") working at University of California, Santa Barbara, I know that most research projects in STEM fields span over a year, and many take more than two years. For those international students (on F-1) who work as a postdoc after their PhD, having the option to extend their OPT for an additional 24 months allows them to focus on the research and not worry about their visa status. This will also save the principal investigators headaches of sponsoring their international postdocs a H1B visa. 

In sum, this proposed rule will help the US keep fresh PhD graduates in the country and contribute towards the research and development.
