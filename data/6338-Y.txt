I strongly support this proposal. Not only because I am a STEM international student. But also this proposal will benefit American Industry. America is a country known by FREEDOM. It encourages high-tech people from EVERY country gathering here for science research. So a lot of students come to America for higher degree education. If this proposal were activitied, they could have more time making contributes to America. With their effort, the market of industry would grow up, which could create MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES for American. This is a WIN-WIN strategy.
