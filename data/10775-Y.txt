I strongly support this action. As a student who currently is benefiting from the OPT Program, I deeply agree that the training opportunity I have with my current employer has helped me implement the knowledge I got from my college education. I consider the experience in a real-life work environment as a necessary, integral part of my college education - in fact, it is one of the most important reasons why I decided to pursue my college experience here in the United States. 

I believe that many students like me myself, and thousands of other people including decision-makers of the millions employers who support the OPT STEM Extension Action, see the tremendous value in and have benefited from this initiative. For students, it is not what we learn that matters the most, but how we use what we learn; for the U.S. employers, in nowadays's global economy, sourcing from the best young talents helps build a stronger work force that supports future growth, which eventually contributes to the U.S. economy. Giving the foreign STEM students the chances to be evaluated and employed by U.S. companies definitely enlarges the pool of young talents from which the companies can fill their most needed positions.

The OPT STEM Extension Action, once set into motion, mostly certainly will reveal its benefits, both in the short term and in the long run.
