I strongly support this policy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please differentiate the H1B workers from the STEM OPT based graduate employees, who are willing to get more properly trained after investing great amount of typical 6-figure tuitions and service fees for this country throughout years. For the latter, who pa the taxes just the same as the citizens, hypothetically they ARE willing to stay and contribute in longer term, they have already gone through the incredibly harsh lottery (brought up out of ridiculous cause but successfully curtail the total number of aliens trying to find a job) to get a work permission settled down. (put Americans first , get it?), and yet this is in disregard to fact that these graduates will find perfect niche any way elsewhere rendering tremendous loss of talents, considering the competitiveness sharpened from the colleges and universities in this country, and ironically, many of the jobs matched especially from the top notch industries turn out to pay really well and have raised the overall salary line!
