It is unreasonable, completely incorrect and harmful to deprive international students' legal right to work in US only because they are not US citizens. The reasons are as follows:

1. United States of America is a country of multi cultures. Everybody here seeks freedom and equality. It is this inclusion of immigrants from different countries makes US become the most prosperous country in the world. Any enclosed country (like Great Britain) would lose its power. If US holds a strict rule towards the international students, in the end, the science and technology of this country will be behindhand. As we all know, most countries across the world, pay a lot attention to high technologies.

2. For dozens of years, skilled and talented international students make a great contribution to US economy, especially on science and technology domain. We could easily see that many great leaders in Fortune 500 companies were once international students. An apt illustration is Google CEO Sundar Pichai, was a native Indian.

3. International students pay a lot money for their education which helped US finance. Additionally, international Ph.D.s are in low pay. They actually don't grab resources from natives. In fact, the achievements they made in science and advanced technology expand US employment a lot.

Based on above statements, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant Students With STEM Degrees and CapGap Relief for All Eligible F1 Students is very necessary for US.
