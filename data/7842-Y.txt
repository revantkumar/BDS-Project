I would like to support this proposal based on following reasons:
1. Students with STEM degree deserve having the choice and opportunity to stay in US, looking for opportunities after years of hard studying. The previous 1 year is so limited and not really helpful.
2. Fairness. After graduating, F-1 students in fact are facing more challenges to find training opportunity since employer would consider the risk of their working status, even for intern. Expanding this to another year is the right move for fairness. Please giving those students a fair stage to purse their dreams after leaving school.
