As we all know, most of the Americans, their parents or grand parents are very likely from another country. The reason that America can be so strong is this country attracts a lot of talented people who work so hard to work and build this empire one by one. It seems like we take those opportunities. But that's not true, for the first reason, we need to over qualify so that we can get one position, we are limited by our status. For the second reason which is the most important thing, we can create job opportunities and create value. A lot of companies were build by us, and we contributed our effort to make this country better. Try to imagine if today, those people are mot willing to work or stay in US, it will be the huge loss for US.
