Ann Anonymous I have been hosting foreign students in my house. 
Many of them are very technology-proficient. I have an old computer that kept break down, and took it to Bestbuy to tune up multiple times. They charged me over $50 each time, but never really fixed it. My guests were kind enough to take a look, and fixed the virus right away.
So, if you let me decide who to hire, I would go for the one who can get the job done. 
If these foreign students are good at what they are doing, let's keep them here to work for us.

I strongly support the OPT program.
