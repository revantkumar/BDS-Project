I can't agree more on the OPT proposal. For those people with citizenships who are fearing that their rights to work would be killed, it is good to think step back that whether they could get a better job without the proposal. We students are not taking their advantages away, instead we are providing a chance to compete fairly. If Americans are those people who are afraid to compete, just hoping anyone stronger than they are else leaves all the treasure to their place and enjoy in the sofa, I would say SCREW YOU.
