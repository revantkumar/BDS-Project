I strongly support this 24 months extension for 3 reasons:
1. Give everyone equal chance is American spirit. Talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. 
2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT fields and create more employment opportunities.
3. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study, do research and make contribution to American society.
