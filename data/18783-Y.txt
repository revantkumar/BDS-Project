This rule is good but needs some amendments as far as the requirement of designated mentors from the employers. 
The training progress reports and designating mentors will add further hassles and complications to the employers in order recruit foreign students. This can affect the overall hiring potential of foreign students. 

The main reason why foreign students come to the United States is because the student program allows students to pursue jobs and get an opportunity to pay back their student loans for the high living costs and cost education. If the employment opportunities are taken away, the inflow of foreign students to U.S. will decrease substantially, thereby affecting the income of educational institutions and staff. Given the large number of employers that employ foreign students, taking drastic actions on the STEM rule can also result in large reduction of labor force. 

Given equal opportunity to both U.S. workers as well as foreign students provides a healthy competition in the market thereby pushing the U.S. labor force to achieve higher and in turn also pushes the economy. 
Taking away the competition will result in availability of more open jobs, but not necessarily more skilled work force. 

Therefore I strongly support this program and hope the United States continues to embrace immigration and skilled labor which, as history has shown, only benefited the country.
