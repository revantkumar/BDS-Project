Why are we not using any available funding to train citizens of the U.S.A?
This rampant illegal use of funding for training of foreign nationals should be consider treason committed on the citizens of the U.S.A.

As far as companies using their workforce to train these aliens, why aren't the present employees offered incentive to remain in their present positions at a reduced rate of compensation.

Why are the idiots running this country into the ground? Would this be considered a conspiracy.
