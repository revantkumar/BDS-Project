Sir or Mam,

I am extremely upset that the DHS would even consider having the Optional Training Period (OPT)in the first place, let alone increase it. According to a recent article, a Freedom of Information Act request from the Center for Immigration Studies revealed OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013, and removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. That is unacceptable. I know of a company in Houston, TX which fired about 15 American native born citizens but maintained all of the Bosnians, people who were barely fit for the position. 

Now DHS is planning on increasing numbers, at the detriment of US citizens? 
Without using profanity, I have to ask: WHY WOULD YOU PROPOSE A RULE WHICH GIVES PREFERENCE TO PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AHEAD OF ITS OWN CITIZENS?

I understand that the DHS works for the Executive branch of government, but I request for the love of country to stop this nonsense, get some backbone and stop this rule in its tracks, and help fellow Americans.
