Flooding the STEM fields with cheap workers is not a reasonable solution for any perceived shortage. Studies have shown that there not a shortage of STEM workers, but rather a they are actually undervalued by companies who do not want to pay a reasonable wage for their services. Extending the OTP program plays into this desire to pay low wages and increase competition in a field already dominated by people willing to work cheaply for the sole purpose of staying in the country. The OPT program is used to circumvent the H-1B requirements, minimal as they are.

The OPT and H-1B program are also used by companies to offshore jobs. It is in the best interest of the government to keep jobs in the United States to increase the tax base and keep it's citizens employed. the vast majority of jobs that go off shore never come back.

I sincerely hope that ICE and the DHS drop the idea of expanding the OPT program and return it to it's original levels, or drop the program altogether. There are already plenty of programs that can be used to keep exceptional foreign students in the country. The OPT program isn't necessary or warranted.
