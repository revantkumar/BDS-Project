I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. It would benefit U.S. society a lot if international students are allowed to work longer here. International students are always hard-working and they will make a lot of contributions to the U.S. If they go back to their own country, many companies in the U.S. would suffer a lot. Meanwhile, other countries would develop because of the income of talents.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S.

3. Competition towards U.S. locals does exist, but it will improve the capability of them, and it will make United States develop better.
