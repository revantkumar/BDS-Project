The Regulations include no plan on how to require the employer to report and prove that it is not replacing U.S. workers with the imported foreign students. Instead, the Regulations leave it up to the imagination of the employers, DHS anticipates, that they have the imagination to show compliance through a variety of existing real-world practices. Of course, the ambiguous language is intentional so as not to hold the employer liable for violations of law.
