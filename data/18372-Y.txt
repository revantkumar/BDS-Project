I strongly support this rule 

1. It's American spirit to give everyone equal chance. And talented students who come to US to study deserves more time to practice their skills after graduation. And remember back to 200 years, all americans are immigrants

2. It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in whatever area. Note those folks are not cheap labors, they all have B.S. or Ph.D. degrees. Are you going to send those clear young treasures to other countries so they can beat us in the future?
