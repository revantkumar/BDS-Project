The Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule to expand the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which gives employers financial incentives to hire foreign students and recent college graduates over Americans. This program has never been authorized by Congress. Currently, foreign students who have been pursuing their degree for at least 9 months can work in the U.S. for 12 months or 29 months if pursuing a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) degree. The new rule would extend the program's length from 12 months to 36 months for these STEM students. The program incentivizes U.S. companies to hire foreign students and recent graduates because they do not have to pay the prevailing wage or their share of the 7.65% payroll taxes for the foreign worker, costing Social Security an estimated $1 billion dollars a year.

"By increasing the total amount of time a foreign student may work in OPT after each degree to 3 yearsthe same amount of time that an H-1B visa would be validthere is little doubt that the Administration has administratively established a de facto shadow H-1B program, in violation of Congressional intent."
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley

I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
