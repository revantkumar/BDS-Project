As a international student, I think OPT is a part of the whole study in U.S. Also, as a STEM student, it is necessary to get more time to practice. Because it is hard to get experience only by class. So the extension is very useful way to help student to get more hand-on experience.

What's more, for industry, they also need international students who have strong ability to help them grow up. The international students do a great contribution for the growth of U.S. industry these years. I cannot imagine if there is no international students in U.S companies, specifically for those IT companies. So it is also benefit for U.S. people.
