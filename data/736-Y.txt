I STRONGLY AGREE the OPT extension for STEM because I do not think you exactly understand how important the competition is in modern society. Actually it is not a bad thing because it will filter out unskilled people who can make less contribution to the development of the America. Our companies need talented students in STEM area to maximize interests because those students can apply their knowledge to the industry efficiently. American admires the strong, not the weak.
