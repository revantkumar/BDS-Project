I don't know how many of those oppose this actually know the situation in IT filed right now. It is NOT that companies only wants to hire foreign students. It is there are not enough American students want to major in these STEM majors. My college CS professor works for Disney, and he mentioned a million time in class that it is hard for them to find qualified programmers. I mean really, companies want to hire american citizens before considering foreign students. There's much higher risk for companies to hire a foreign student, because they may fail to get a work visa after their opt then the company has to hire new ones. Those managers are not fools, but let's face the truth, many of our young kids today are too lazy to take these majors which involves more "boring" math or physics. I am a huge supporter for this program, they are taking our jobs, but they are taking those jobs which we can find a qualified American for this.
