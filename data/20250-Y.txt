I strongly support expanding OPT for STEM students. 
The comment from Dr.Moncilovich (ID: ICEB-2015-0002-3450 Tracking Number: 1jz-8lz2-moh2) is lack of rational judgement for the reasons:
1. OPT for STEM students is a student training program that does not place any foreign persons over US Citizens in the job market competition or the education competition. Instead, this student training program attracts more foreign students come to US for study. Colleges increase the number of foreign students without sacrificing any education opportunity of US citizens. The foreign students pay tuition and spend money in US. This provides more local job openings and increases local economic. 
2. The OPT program does not cause US Citizens AND Veterans out of work. Foreign students are only allowed to be trained (OPT) in their specified field of study, only when there is no suitable US-citizen job candidate other than international students. Especially in STEM, there is a lack of suitable candidate. Stopping STEM OPT expansion will hurt STEM companies and US economic. 
3. The STEM OPT expansion program is a non-immigration student training program that has nothing to do with 'tighten immigration' at all. 
In summary, what you concern is actually explained in Section III.A, regarding the safeguards to protect our US workers. Please read through before comment. Thanks.
