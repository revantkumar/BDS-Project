America is definitely in shortage of STEM graduates, especially Computer Science graduates. According to US Department of Education, only 40k - 50k American undergraduates choose Computer Science as their major. This number is far sway from enough, because US department of labor statistics show that US creates more than 180K computer science related new jobs every year. We should definitely allow legal international students to stay in the USA! Totally support this rule!
