I strongly support the extension proposal. Education is an important market which can help recover American economy. The tuition of international students is very expensive. There are many other countries that are trying to attract more international students. It's a great advantage for America giving a good practical chance to attract the most talent students from all over the world. In addition, the job market doesn't welcome international students as it does for Americans. Most of the local and small companies don't give job positions for international students at all. Therefore, only the most talent and hard working students can find a job, stay and make contributions to America, which is good for everyone. Only America becomes better and better, the life of Americans could become better and better, right?
