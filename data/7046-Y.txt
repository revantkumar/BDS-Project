Ronald Shipe I always thought, like my parents, that the democratic party was on the side of the American working CITIZEN. I am now totally convinced that this is not true. We are now independents and will vote for the party that we feel will stand up for the Citizens of this nation. Right now that looks like Trunp or Cruz. the Democrat party has left the working middle class.
