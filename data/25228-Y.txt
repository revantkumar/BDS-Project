I strongly SUPPORT this new OPT policy for the below reasons:

Firstly, foreign students working on OPT pay taxes and therefore help economy grows. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge loss.Those property renting, food service and other industries will face huge loss.

Secondly, here is no guarantee how long it will take and how much it will cost to train all US students to fully compensate loss of foreign students. Without this policy, numerous companies in the United States will face serious shortage of STEM workers suddenly and tremendous loss.

Therefore, I highly support this new policy and really hope this could be APPROVED
