I strongly SUPPORT this proposal!!!!
First of all, international students contributed tramendous growth to the USA economy especially in tech area. Most of American tech companies need skilled students as workforce. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen.
Second, some specific programs in graduate school are consist of large percent of international students, such as statistics and computer science. It does not make sense that US government puts effort to cultivate foreign students but do not give them enough time to contribute to the country. Besides, if US lost these source of workers, it is difficult to find enough workers to maintain the operation and innovation. Without the embraciveness of foreign workers, I can forsee someday very soon when USA economy stagnates, people lose jobs, and social problems arises.
There is a distinction between normal people and talents. USA needs the talents from foreign workers to keep its machiens running well, and running better than the rest of the world.
