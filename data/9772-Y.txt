I STRONGLY SUPPORT this rule even I am not a STEM student and here are my reasons:
1.It is part of American spirit to give everyone equal chance. Talented students who came to US to pursue their education deserves an equal chance to work in the industry he/she is talented at. For most of the cases, these industries are STEM related. 
2. It should be the employers to decide whether they want their employees to continue working for them or not, not the F1 status. Employers will be loosing a large amount of talented employees especially in the IT industry if this rule is not implemented. However, this may not necessarily mean more job opportunities for the US citizens if they are not educated and trained for the STEM related industries. Consequently, the lack of capable employees in the STEM related industries will cause a recession in the US economy.
3.Implementing this rule helps the nation's colleges and universities to remain globally competitive in attracting talented students.
