I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

First of all, The government should let students who acquired knowledge from U.S. universities keep making contribution to U.S.. We provide the best facility, faculty and academic environment to international students. We need a policy to encourage them to stay instead of going back to their home countries. It's a huge loss for U.S. if they have no opportunity to contribute to this country.

Secondly, STEM students are extremely important for our country. U.S. is the only super power in the world. We can send human to moon. We can be the leader of high-tech industry. Can you imagine we can do this without STEM students? Of course not! We need more engineers and scientists to keep U.S. leading the world. 

Additionally, U.S. will lose its reputation in opening. It's well-known that U.S. welcomes engineers and scientists. We need them. If this extension can not be approved, what the world will think about us?? They will say U.S. is becoming conventional. U.S. will be far away from the world. Oh my god, is that what we expected? People will laugh at us!

As discussed above, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal!
