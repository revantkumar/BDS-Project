I highly support this proposal. The STEM OPT extension helps the foreigner students with high education background have the opportunity to contribute to the US industry, academia and economy. Especially, a lot of foreigner students got financial support from US organization such like NSF and NIH. It will be waste of money if all these highly educated talents have to leave US w/o OPT extension. I believe this new STEM OPT extension rule will enable those students help the development of the science and technology and boost US economy in the long run.
