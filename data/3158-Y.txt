Aditi Sachdeva Dear Sir, 

I would like you to consider OPT for NON-STEM students working in the field of Science and Big data like me. Although, I have a Marketing degree, I am working in the field of Web Analytics and Big data. My work involves programming, coding and analysis which enables me to offer a great set of skills and expertise to the US job market. However, just because my degree falls under NON-STEM course, I can't avail the OPT extension. I strongly believe, that the job category & function should decide the OPT extension eligibility rather than just the course. Many students with STEM degrees end up not working in their field of study. Students like me, with technical knowledge, have a lot to offer to the employers. 
Hence, please consider offering STEM extension to students working in the field of science and technology although their course might not be a STEM course.

Thank you.
