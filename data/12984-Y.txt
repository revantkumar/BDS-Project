I strongly support the proposed two-year STEM extension and the possible three-year stay post graduation for international students. International students pay a huge amount of tuition fee to get quality education here in the US and contribute positively to the industry/academia in a lot of STEM fields mainly including Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and other engineering backgrounds. A lot of them leave their parents and friends in their home country to come to the US to help grow it's economy. Giving the international students the STEM extension helps them in working in the industry, which helps in paying off the hefty student loans almost every international student has on their head.
