I strongly support the proposal of improving and expanding STEM OPT. The STEM OPT only applies for international students with positions in e-verify program. The e-verify program requires employers follow equal opportunity rule, regardless of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), or national origin. Thus STEM OPT extension will not take away US residents job opportunities. 

The students with STEM OPT are paying taxes, and making contribution for the growth of companies. Thus companies will have more profit and pay more taxes. The whole US residents will get benefits from those taxes. This proposal is a win-win proposal.
