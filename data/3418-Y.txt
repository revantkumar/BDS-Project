Junyi Huang I strongly agrees with the extension of the OPT program to be another 24 months. This in total will be three years for the opt period students who find a job in the U.S to accomplish their projects at their companies or at school. For these group of people, the projects, mostly with advanced technology, will take around three years to accomplish from the beginning. It is important for their formal employers and themselves to complete the whole period since we know for one experiment, it will be difficult to process with new added people or to miss some one. Therefore, it is very important that these people will not be forced to leave the country before they accomplish their tasks. This will be beneficial to their employers and also the local industry.
