Fengjia Xiong I strongly feel the need of OPT extension. 
Firstly, the majority of the Engineering school students are consist of international students, and there are also a great amount of employees in technical companies coming from a foreign country. Hence, if there is no OPT extension, probably a half of the new employees of those big IT companies, e.g. Google, Facebook, Amazon, may face a serious situation of losing thousands of excellent qualified engineers every year. This will have a huge influence on economy.
Secondly, without OPT extension, we STEM major students may have only 12 month to gain working experience, which is way too far to be enough. When we come back to our home country, students with insufficient experience and degree in foreign universities may also face a lot of difficulties of seeking job opportunities. However, if we are capable of working for 36month, i.e. with OPT extension, we will be able to have solid background to compete with others or start our own business when we come back to our home country.
Above are the two major reasons that I think weighing much in the OPT extension.
