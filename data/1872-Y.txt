I think it is very important to extend the OPT by another 24 months for the following reason. Expanding OPT time allows international students to work for United States for a longer time, and contribute their knowledge into the academy and industry of United States. As we all know, diversity is what this country famous for and what makes innovations. The possibility to increase diversity by expanding OPT is greatly enhanced by promising more international workforce that United States welcome you if you can make technological contributions.
