I strongly support the new rule to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students. America is such a country that wants to attract the smartest and creative people in the world. Therefore, it provide lots of education opportunity to foreign students, who will further contributes to the technology, industry in the future. It is stupid to send these well educated people back to other countries. Some posts point out that this rule will eats away the opportunities for America students. Actually benign competition is definitely beneficial to the industry and the country in that people will try to improve themselves to become more competitive in the job market.
