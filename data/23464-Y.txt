I strongly SUPPORT the new 24-month OPT extension for STEM graduates. 

It is beneficial to America as a lot of American students choose finance, economics, MBA as their most desired majors and work for wall street after graduation. So, If the STEM major is no longer attractive to foreign students. American STEM industry will not be able to find enough engineer, scientist to compete with other countries. America will LOSE the current competitive and good situation in the 21st century!
