I feel like there is a lot of misinformation in the comments with regard to this proposed rule, and I would like to correct some of it while explaining why this rule is not just a good one, but it's absolutely essential for improving the US economy. Please note that I'm speaking based on my experiences as a recent Statistics graduate (M.A.).

First of all, the OPT does not take jobs from qualified Americans. There are many, many reasons for this,and it's difficult to describe them all. 

* Companies have a very strong preference for domestic talent, due to language issues, visa issues, and cultural mismatches; thus an equally skilled American worker will ALWAYS win over a foreign worker (in fact, even a significantly less skilled American can often get the job). 

* There aren't enough Americans in post-graduate education, and the ones that are are simply not as talented as foreign students. There is a flagging domestic interest in STEM postgraduate degrees -- in 2015, less than 50% of postgraduate STEM degrees went to American citizens, according to the Pew Research Center. For many schools, the actual percentage is much, much higher. In my department, 80% to 90% of students were foreign. If you think the solution is for schools to hire more domestic talent, then know that in my cohort, my school had 20 domestic applicants and 220 foreign applicants. It's much harder to get accepted as a foreign student and thus the foreign students who do get accepted are better. Thus, it's clear that Americans (at least in my field) simply aren't chasing the post-graduate education that many employers need. Foreign students are fulfilling a need for skilled workers that Americans cannot supply by themselves. 

* The opt only lasts 12 months, and the proposed rule allows for a 17 month extension for STEM graduates only. This is less than three years, not a long time from the perspective of companies. In order to retain workers hired via OPT, they need an H1-B visa, which is expens
