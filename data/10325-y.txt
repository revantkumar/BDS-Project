Rajat Jain I strongly encourage the extension of F1-OPT program for international students with STEM degree. In United States, there are lot opportunities and a platform for people who have technical backgrounds. I have seen people are working on a lot of new technological ideas and solving challenging problems. I believe US need more talented people who could contribute in the technological advancement for a continuous research and development. International students on STEM program have already made a huge contribution in research and development in US, providing them an opportunity to work for couple of years more will tremendously contribute to US tech industries growth and also to the overall growth of the country.
