Ding Yao Strongly support opt extension. For instance, a lot of smart and innovative international students worked at google using opt extension after graduation. They are making great contributions to the company, making the services provided by google such as google search, google map, chrome and etc be better and better. Imagine how can we live without google search and google map:) and since international students can make the existing services better or even create new service which can make people's life better or even change the world. why not let them stay in the US to do so? so why not opt extension:)
