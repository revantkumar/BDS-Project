I strongly SUPPORT OPT Extension extending from 17 months to 24 months. First, international researchers/ employees are helping the US keep staying on top of the world in many fields as Technology, Mathematics, Medical, Engineering...at least one point should be clear: who are qualified for STEM OPT Extension? Those students who are SMART & GENIUS, and have higher graduate degree as PhD & Masters. Why should the US raise so many genius with full-scholarship but send them back to its competitors later? 

Second, international people are not taking any advantage from social security. Instead, the taxes rate they paid is as equal as any US citizen. Their tax payment are used to improve US welfare. Actually, it is the US gets economy benefit from internationals. 

Third, people shouldn't blame the unemployment rate to internationals. The economic laws showing that, definitely, financial crises happened naturally in every 5 - 10 years. Also, if citizens study/work hard, they are much easier to get jobs than internationals, because citizens are not limited on any working authority! In my class, all native students got perfect job after graduation, while most of international students didn't get employed because they are limited by the working authority.

At last, this positive news can greatly improve the passion of international students to study in the US, whose tuition is TWICE more than a US citizen student. No one can deny their contributions to the US education system after 2008 financial crises.
