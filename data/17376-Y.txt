I really support this rule because of several reasons. First, U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. Second, Working or creating a startup in my OPT duration is highly likely to bring about more job opportunities to American.Thirdly, all these STEM students have got advanced degrees, they could make more contribution to this county than a lot of native people.
