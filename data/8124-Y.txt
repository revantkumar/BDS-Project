The United States really needs to keep those who has obtained good education in U.S. universities, especially in STEM fields, to help strengthen the technical advantages over other countries. Americans do not really want them go back to their home countries and help build their strengths there. In addition, these well educated fellows can really help to start new businesses and thus creating more well paid jobs for Americans. I, personally, think this is of critical importance for helping the U.S. to keep moving toward and lead the world into the future.
