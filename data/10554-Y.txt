The competitive nature of STEM industries mandates that we attract and retain the best to remain a forerunner in these fields. Students who receive a STEM education in the United States should be confident that they will have the time necessary to find OPT opportunities and have adequate time to apply for citizenship.

Thus, I fully support allowing such STEM students to remain in the United States of America longer with the intent to acquire citizenship.
