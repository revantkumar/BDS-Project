I will really APPRECIATE it if the government could make this rule approved. I just signed the offer letter from Google, however, cannot be happy with the current situation, as I am in my current OPT-extension status. Really worried about when my OPT-extension will come to an end, as the offer will be valid only if I am still legal to work in U.S.

Today's breaking news brought by Google "TensorFlow, Googles Open Source AI, Signals Big Changes in Hardware Too". Imagine how much Google foreign employees have contributed to all the amazing projects, and how these help U.S. citizens, companies and government. This contribution sometimes become so crucial that we shouldn't ignore them.

Some U.S. citizens mentioned how this rule affect their finding jobs, but actually this is not a "zero and game": FOREIGN "STEM" EMPLOYEES IN ARE HELPING CREATING JOBS FOR U.S.. Here I will just give an example in terms of my role. I will work as a software engineer in Android OS system team in Google, and that team actually has and will have many foreign employees. Without Android system created by Google, how could there will be thousands of Android engineer positions in other companies for both U.S. and foreign citizens?

So please, let this rule passed. For thousands of scientists and engineers this is the only hope we will be enrolled in our dream company and help make a better America.
