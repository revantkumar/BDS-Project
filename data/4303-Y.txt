As a potential student applying for stem program in US, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
1.The main reason that I choose US but not UK or other countries to study is that I want to work in US for several years. After graduation, I plan to try my best to find a job, not only because US has various resource and attractive working environment, but also because once I go back to my hometown to work, I will become more competitive. And the longer the OPT period is, the larger chance I would get a job. Therefore, I am in favor of the extension of OPT in order to realize my dream.
2.One of the reasons that I choose to apply for stem program is that it has longer OPT period than other programs. Last weekend I met with a recruiter from a university and she told me how international can benefit from the longer OPT period in stem program. On the other hand, I think, US can also benefit with more talent people work for their companies. Beside, we would need to rent house and consume commodities when we work in US. Since the OPT benefit both, the proposal should be support without any doubt.
