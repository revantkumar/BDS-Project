I absolutely support DHS new regulation to improve and expand the training opportunities for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM Degrees.
First of all, international students contribute a lot to USA especially in Science. Some people believe these students will compete with local people, and take away more jobs. That is not true. More than 50% percent of the Ph.D candidates are foreign born and the percent of foreigners in the high technology systems is even higher. In fact, America needs these scientists and engineers make significant contribution to create the whole high-tech industries. 
Besides, there are not enough domestic graduate students who can fill up the demanding need of the high technology industry. Inputting more intelligent international students is beneficial for America. Eliminating the STEM extension, more and more intelligent students will be less willing to go to university. That is a huge loss both in economy and technology.
