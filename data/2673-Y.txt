Dear Sir or Madam,

I am a wife of a husband who is still a F1 visa holder at a university. He needs an OPT extension while he transitions to H1B. It is not your interest to break his career as an assistant professor on tenure track since he would contribute to his university and also to the U.S. society if he could keep his position. It takes time to get H1B sometimes. Please do not finish OPT extension. Also, if he loses the extension and thus has to lose the position, it is harmful for his university, too, since it spent lots of resource to search and hire him. In addition, if this happens in the future, it will discourage many universities/colleges and companies to hire international students. I believe the U.S. gets an advantage by attracting and gathering good international students and hire them to its companies so that the U.S. can continuously be very competitive in the world. The end of OPT extension will make it harder for STEM international students to get more experiences and get a job in the U.S. The attractiveness of the higher education for them in the U.S. will decrease, too. I think it is not the interest of the U.S. in a long run.

Thank you.
