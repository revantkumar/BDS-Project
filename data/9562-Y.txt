I think this is the right thing to do. Many internationals are perusing masters in this country with hope for better education and a platform to prove themselves in their feild of in their feild of interest. New opt rule would provide now "immigrants" the opportunity to achieve their goals. As far as Americans not getting their jobs that's a joke. I don't see any American graduate jobless because immigrants are the cause.
