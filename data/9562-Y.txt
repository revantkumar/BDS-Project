Yufei Ai I totally support this rule to be approved. This rule will attrack more international students to study, communicate and experience in US. This will bring a lot of benefits to US with regards of economy, technology and culture.
Universities in US welcome international students quite a lot. My school locates in a small town and International students promotes the local economy significantly. Many parents of the students visited them and traveled in the country frequently. 
Students who will gain benefits from this rule are those who have high level education, diligence and talents. Even though OPT will be expanded to 3 years, those students less competitive is still hardly to take advantage of this rule. Employers will choose those people who can contribute most for the country.
As there are more and more global collaboration regarding business and research, for many times international students can serve as a bridge to global markets. Moreover, we are fostered by US universities and companies. When we come back to our home country, we will definitely bring the american culture to our future workplaces and friend circles. 
Those are the exciting facts that will come true if the rule can be approved.
