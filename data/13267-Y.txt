OPT holders are not Illegal Immigrants! Most of us came here for advanced degrees with full scholarship from US government/private universities. I myself got my PhD in mechanical engineering with full scholarship. US is a great nation because of its diverse culture, its possibility to live a better life through working hard, its foundation on God the creator. OPT is a TEMPORARY and LEGAL status for full time job in a company for a max of 2 years. Talents globally come here to compete for the same position. Yes, it means Americans have to get really competitive to get the job and yes, some Americans may lose job in the short run. But this forces the government to think, to improve its education systems, to increase its focus on Math and Science, which is the right direction. This is painful but the only way that US can keep its leading edge in science and technology in years to come. 

OPT holders do not sacrifice at all in terms of salaries. We get the job because we are really good at what we do, not because we require less pay than Americans. 

Please don't mix OPT holders with ILLEGAL immigrants. Totally agree that everyone needs to obey the law .
