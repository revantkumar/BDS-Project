Yiying Hu I strongly SUPPORT for this proposal!!!
competition does exist, but accept competition is what a wise man will do! international student pays a lot energy and money to study in the US, but we hope we can NOT ONLY STUDY ON CAMPUS. more internship is the key to make us more valuable to serve our country and US as well.
