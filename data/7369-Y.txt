first,OPT is a good thing in long run.If there are more applicants to compete a job,it actually can produce more profits and select a more appropriate applicant for that job.
on the other hand,America has a spirit of freedom and tolerance.I think expanding OPT is the best way to show the whole world that America is a great country with many opportunities and chances.
And it is not a immigration matter,it is a form about F-1 nonimmigrant students,I don't see any flaws for this form.
