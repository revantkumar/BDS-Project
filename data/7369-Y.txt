Justin Zhang The OPT extension is critical to this country because it can bring the well educated and most intelligent workers for United States. As we know US has the best colleges all over the world and that is the reason why it attracts the best students from almost all other counties coming here to build this great country. If the extension is terminated that means America will lose lots of most intelligent workers and at the same time fewer and fewer smart student will choose to come here and contribute to this country. It will damage the economy and culture diversity of US in near future. It is radiculous to think international student will take the job opportunities from Americans, because the number of jobs is not decided by population but by the economy. America can be America is just because it can allow intelligent people doing something here. So I strongly recommend to get the policy approved.
