We definitely should get this approved in seek of better development of both international students and American education. 

Put what I heard as an example. I have a lot of friends in China who are considering further their study oversea. Previously, most of them regard American Universities as their preferred choices over European Universities because the longer OPT period in America. Longer working experience will make them more competitive in Chinese job market after they come back. However, if the OPT only last for one year, they are very likely to choose other universities in other countries. They are not the only ones. The length of OPT will definitely affect the decision of millions of students. Less students will affect the education funds, which probably leads to a degrade of education qualities.
