I strongly support this proposal. 

F1 nonimmigrant STEM students, normally aged between 20 and 30, are groups of innovative and productive workforce, powerful consumers as well as influx of culture diversity. They have proved themselves to be irreplaceable in many realms of American industry, such as high-tech, basic and applied scientific research, medical/health, media/multimedia and communication, environment and so on. Companies and organizations are willing to hire them despite the increased amount of cost and processes compared to hiring local people due to mainly two reasons:1. There are insufficient number of American citizens/permanent residents who are willing to take these occupations. 2. The F1 nonimmigrant STEM students, through their efforts, have brought their employers lots of interests, vitality and growing potential, which is beneficial to themselves, and more importantly, to the U.S. economy. Many of the non-immigrant students came to the U.S. self-supported, which helps colleges gain funding for building facilities and conduct research. After graduation, they continue to be one of the largest group of consumers, spend lots of money on travelling, purchasing electronics, luxury products, vehicles and even real estates. The amount of money each of them spend is probably enough to create several, or even more working opportunities. Besides, as the F1 nonimmigrant students come from all over the world, they bring their customs, lifestyle, art and other cultural beliefs into the U.S., nourishing this country's own culture.

Therefore, I would by all means recommend the U.S. government to give more opportunities to these young people and let them help build a more prosperous and progressive American society.
