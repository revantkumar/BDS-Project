This is a HORRIBLE idea. When AMERICAN STEM graduates are working at Starbucks to pay back their studen loans the government wants to open up our few good jobs to these foreigners. It's common knowledge that many of these students, particularly from China, are sent here and their education paid for in hopes of getting information and entrenching themselves in our government to spy on us. Of course, these students AGREE NOT TO WORK IN THE USA AND TO LEAVE PROMPTLY after they get their education. But here they want to reneg on this promise! The government seems to want more programs like Disney and So California Edison where the STEM employess HAD TO TRAIN THEIR FOREIGN NATIONAL REPLACEMENTS. The H1B visas are specifically NOT for this but they did it anyway. What will happen with these students? This is just a sneaky way to get around the requirements of immigration. To go to the head of the line illegally. The USA generously allows a million people from around the world into our country each year. That is already too many. We do not need to give away our jobs to these questionable people from foreign countries. There are MORE than enough US STEM graduates to fulfill the need. And this law does not even require that US graduates be considered FIRST for any job. Indeed, they don't even have to openly publish the job openings in the USA before hiring one of these unwelcome intruders. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THESE DE FACTO INVASION! It's time to realize that the people of the USA pay the taxes and they DESERVE to reap the benefits of the jobs and the opportunities in our own country!!!
