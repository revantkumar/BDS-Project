Forigners work hard to get a job. They spent years of study, months of job hunting to find their place in the US society. America should give new immigrants a chance. They are not stealing jobs, rather, they are bringing competition and more innovations in the work force, making the United States a more powerful country. Stop the narrow patriotism! Embrace the diversity!
