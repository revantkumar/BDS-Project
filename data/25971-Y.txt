This is a cool proposal. 

US is a country formed by immigrants. People from different countries contribute their talents and share their culture, which makes this country energetic and top of the world. Even for the ones who object this proposal, probably they also immigrated a few generations ago. Like international business, we cannot rely on trade barriers to cultivate the domestic market. If isolated from the world, the US market and people will be less competitive, and thus will be caught up with.

This proposal will affect some citizens somehow, but overall this will encourage people work more diligent and motivate the country to be more prosperous.
