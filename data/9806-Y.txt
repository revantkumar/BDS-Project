I strongly support the extension for STEM programs, for the following reason:
1. It is of economic rule of capitalism---you get what you pay for. STEM program request more strict in terms of admission, higher GPA, higher GMAT, higher GRE than non-STEM programs. And finishing STEM programs demand more efforts, time and money than non-STEM majors. It should turn out that STEM majors deserve a longer time for opportunity training period.
2.Within the IT world, it would turn out better if programmers or whoever does the code has a different culture point of view, since in the end, what is finished needs to be shared globally.
3. In an enterprise kind of setting, it is who produce the best value for the company matters, STEM students work harder and will reach better result for the business and other industry.
