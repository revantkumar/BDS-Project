I really think the policy is so good.

First it can be a very important reason let good students choose to study in USA from all over the world, this can let the American culture be more diversity.

And this can let company hire better students with low salary. and also can let students get good work experience in USA.

This can be a profit for USA government spends so much money on student.

So I can not agree more with this policy!
