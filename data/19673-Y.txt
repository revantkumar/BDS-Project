I am strongly supporting for this decision!!

First, the reason why I choose to continue my study in USA, other than Canada, Australia or the United Kingdom, is the combination of the advanced education and technology and the OPT policy after graduation. Therefore, I can turn those knowledge learned in the class into practice experience in industry. 

Second, I learned about the STEM OPT extension when I was doing my application for graduate study, and planned to gain some work experience during the one year (original) plus 17 months period. However, when I graduated in May this year, there comes the bad news that the OPT extension will be canceled next year. My plans and schedules went completely off the rail by that. If you would like to not continue the STEM OPT extension, the best way is to announce two years before execution. Thus, many students, who knows about the change of OPT may not be attracted to study here.

Third, for many industry practice, one year is not enough to complete. We need more time to focus on one project to make it done completely and perfectly. If we only have one year time limit, we may doing the project halfway, and let others to take over, which would have a bad influence on the progress, even made the project unsuccessful.

There are so many reasons to support for the decision. It is just like the rights. Someone may not use it the whole life. But for others who do need this, the extension may have huge impact on academe and industry world.
