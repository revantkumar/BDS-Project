OPT extension is necessary and significant to the economic development of US in the future. Highly educated F1 students are equipped well with the advanced technology. After graduation, most of them will work in the technology and science domain. Their contribution to a company and the big society is obvious and has been proved in the past. If the OPT of STEM will not be illegally extended to 24 months, after one year's working people with OPT will not be able to continue their contribution. One common sense is that in most cases long-term and sustainable work has the power to make development in technology or science. The failure of people's OPT extension mostly will stop the development in technology and science and therefore delay the development of the economy of the whole country. From the long-term development of the whole country, it is highly recommended to give permission to the capable people the working right.
