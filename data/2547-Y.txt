Ru Wang, Carnegie Mellon University Support expanding OPT! I am a CS major student. And there are lots and lots CS students like me. I give up good school opportunities of UK, it's because CS major student in US has OPT, so that we can see the future working opportunity. Without OPT, I really don't see the difference of studying in US and other top school around the word. Don't let thousands of engineers going back to their country now! IT company needs us and US need us!!
