There are many things I could articulate concerning why the US Government should not improve and expand the training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees and offer Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-! students, but for the purposes of brevity, I will limit my discussion to one issue: As a recently retired educator, I worked in a school district that had and continues to prioritize STEM education--as the Federal government wished--not only did our little, rural school district establish courses to prepare students in STEM, but featured clubs and other extension activities to include competitions regionally and beyond, and expositions of projects for the community to heighten student and parent awareness and interest. STEM caught on, students rose to the occasion, parents and the broader community saw the value of the endeavor--that is until reports filtered back that recent;y graduating students couldn't get jobs using their STEM educations. That takes the incentive out of any project when a community invested in STEM learns that there are no, or not that many, jobs in STEM for all the students we are training and setting on that course.

As an educator with 50+ years experience at retirement, I see the STEM education initiative in K-12 schools, technical school and community colleges has gone the way of other initiatives I've watched and been apart of for the past five decades as an educator: first there's the hype, then the buy-in (coerced or otherwise), then the glut of students trained and pointed in that initiatives direction, then the market flooding, and finally the let down when graduating students can't find jobs in which to use that training. 

When we seek to prioritize a training, nationally, then we should support the job market, nationally, for those American students we've trained. Not to do so demoralizes, at the least, those whose focus has been turned to prepare themselves for that opportunity--including all stakeholders: stu
