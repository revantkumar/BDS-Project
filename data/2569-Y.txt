Deepti Mullur I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. This is also imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness.

And please consider a request to increase the H1B visa % for students who are on extended visa
