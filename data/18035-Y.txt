I think the OPT extension of 24 months is necessary and constructive. 

To begin with, OPT does not take away the job opportunities from local STEM students but instead help to meet the need of U.S STEM industry. 

The short on STEM works is real. For one thing, wages have grown relatively fast in most STEM-oriented occupations, which is a clear indication of a shortage. Software developers, for instance, saw salaries soar 26 percent over the same period, culminating in an average of $82,000 in 2013, up from $48,000 in 1980. In addition, vacancies for STEM jobs are going unfilled in large numbers. There are some 40,000 computer science bachelor's degree earners each year but roughly 4 million job vacancies for computer workers.(cite from U.S News: Short on STEM Talent)

Next, OPT is indeed different from H-1B and definitely not a shadow of H-1B.

The OPT program is completely different from H-1B in both legal and practical regards. H-1B is a legal working visa which requires the assistance of an employer in order to apply while OPT(Optional Practical Training) is a program which gives the STEM students a period of time right after their graduation to put into practice what they learned at school and make a contribution to American economy. In practical, H-1B has a CAP in each round of selection while OPT comes with and advance degree in the STEM domain in certified U.S colleges/universities. Basically, OPT gives the foreign STEM students a chance to prove their capabilities and the best among them all will be selected by employers for H-1B. Actually the longer OPT period helps America to retain the best STEM elites within the country.
