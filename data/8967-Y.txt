I'm Chinese and I'm a STEM Ph.D. candidate. I miss parents and authentic Chinese food, so going back China is not a bad choice for me. If I have about several years work experience in US, I would be competitive in the job market of China. That's why this new OPT rule would benefit both US high-tech industry and international STEM talents.
