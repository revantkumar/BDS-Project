I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. The reasons are as follow:
1. For international students, the most appealing part to study in US is its OPT program. Without extended OPT, we can expect significantly less talented international students go to US for their graduate studies, especially in STEM area. This will be a bad thing for international academic collaboration between US university and the rest of the world, and have negative effects for US to maintain its leading position in Science and Technology.

2. Normally, it takes a new comer about half a year to be familiar with all the routine work in a company. If the OPT is only 12 months, before the employee can generate some revenue for the company, they are going to leave. This will definitely be hazardous to the profit of US company as well as taxation.

3. High tech international students contributes a lot for the US technology and economic growth. And because of the technology industry grows, more and more US citizens would like to learn STEM majors than before. And because of the competition from international students, Americans will work harder to study the new technology and that is a positive cycle. 

4. Without OPT extension, these talented students will work for other companies outside US with the knowledge learned from US schools and compete with the US companies. Some of them may create their own companies to earn US companies market and there will have less jobs for Americans.

5. Don't forget why we have OPT extension before, because US companies cannot find such talented American students. If you have concerned about unfair salary or taxation, you can set a rule to let the companies show their salary reports and let all employees pay Social Security Tax and Medicare tax. As far as I know, the salary is not lower than American citizens at all, and most Phd students stay in US more than five years and they also need to pay Social Security Tax and Medicare tax.
