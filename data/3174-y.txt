Lang Gao I strongly support the extension. The prosperity of America originated from the tolerance and acceptance of different cultures and the import of intelligent people from all around the world. All men are created equal. All men should Be given equal opportunities. Employees are qualified in terms of capabilities, not of nationality. If you need to secure your jobs, try hard to equip yourself with essential skills to prove your value, don't just drive more qualified people away! Competence will bring America a brighter future, whereas incapable people with secured jobs will kill the country's future.
