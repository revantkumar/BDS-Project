OPT Extension is really important, both for U.S. citizens and international students.

First of all, OPT Extension makes it possible for more international STEM students to contribute their knowledge and skills here in the US. These intelligent youth can add energy to the related companies, bringing new ideas. Different thoughts from them may lead to revolution in technology.
As OPT Extension is especially for STEM, obviously US still needs a lot more STEM talents for the development of science and technology.

Secondly, gaining more working experience here in US helps these students to build their career and also helps them to understand who they are better at the same time.

Last but not the least, more than two years of working experience here in US can give these international students more chance to know, and then love this country. Even after going back to their home country, surely they'll still think about contributing the US.

So OPT Extension has a significant meaning for both US and international students.
