I sincerely welcome this step of DHS to retain STEM talent after graduate school. Almost 70% of the graduate students directly take admission in graduate school and extending OPT for 24 months will enable them to apply their school learning in professional setting. This also helps United States to retain talented/skilled workforce, leading to overall development of the country. 

Almost every STEM tech company decides compensation based on competence rather than VISA status or nationality. Also I haven't come across any abuse of working hours or wages for OPT workforce.
