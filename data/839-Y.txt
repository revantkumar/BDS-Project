Gladys Flournoy It is wrong that foreign students are allowed to stay in this country and take jobs from our own citizens. They, in fact get preferential treatment due to tax breaks go themselves and the companies. Even though these are college graduates, DHS designates them as foreign students. Foreign students don't pay payroll taxes. And neither does the employer. The employer is exempt from paying the 6.2% Social Security and 1.45% Medicare taxes. That nearly 8 percent difference means an employer can save money by hiring a foreigner over an American.
This is wrong in so many ways. There should be no foreigners allowed to work here until our qualified citizens have jobs. There are plenty of educated citizens denied jobs due to this preferential treatment
