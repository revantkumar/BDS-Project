I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

I want to dispute those arguments of negative comments:

Foreign Students take away jobs and do not pay tax: foreign students working on OPT PAY TAX and they help local economies. Without foreign students, US universities and research institutions will face huge loss.Those property renting, food service and other industries will face huge loss

There is no shortage of US students in STEM: Quantity does not mean quality. There are also a huge number of foreign students in STEM but only a very small proportion of them can pass the strict interviews and finally get a job by US companies
