I personally support this new change in the OPT policy on F1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. International students have played an role that can not be ignored in the U.S. economy. And due to the restriction on the H1-B visa policy, it is more crucial for F1 students now to legally work in the U.S. 
However, those F1 students who have learned from higher education institutes here and would like to work in the U.S. could have contribute better and more with this new policy. U.S. as an immigrant country, should keep its door open for the world, especially those people with their knowledge, experience and talents.
