well, a reasonable person would agree to this extension. Just think about this,,, if you want all foreigners out of US, only the native Americans, AKA indians can leave in this island... So, it actually means that all of us who can contribute to this country should be welcomed to live here. And the government shouldn't try to shut them out.
