You do understand in order to get OPT you need a JOB, right? How is a worker getting freebies like people who are on welfare? 
Are you suggesting that ALL of us are getting freebies regardless of working or not? Then there is no point of restricting freebies because by your argument, all of us are getting freebies anyway. 
Logic, my friend, is more important than PhD title.
