I strongly support the proposed rule.

U.S.A. is a nation founded on the basis of Constitution and its a melting pot of variety of cultures. People who claim that students with OPT extension of 24 months will take their job opportunities are very short sighted. Its not about taking up opportunities, however, for the country, its about eliminating the unqualified; for individual, its about encouraging everyone to be better. With this US can keep its outstanding status in different perspectives, especially Science, Technology, Engineering and Math areas. 

More opportunities will be created if we have more startups and collaborating more with foreign companies, bringing in more foreign investors. For example, more than 20,000 startups have $5 million average valuation, $104k average salary and 31,999 investors prosper in Silicon Valley area. (https://angel.co/silicon-valley)

Opportunities not only exist in the current job market, it also exists in a creative manner that needs time to develop. For instance, the co-founder of InstagramMike Krieger had almost left the country. As he said It took less time to build Instagram than it did for me to get my work visa. We might let go so many talented and innovated international students who could benefit us a lot in our daily lives.
