It is a good idea to expand Training Opportunities for F1 Nonimmigrant Students.

Those students are highly qualified and make great contributions to the communities and different scientific industries.

According to an announcement of Obama's government in March 2015, the nation lacks a total of 500,000 intelligents in IT industry. International students are in huge demand to help improve this situation.

International students also help the nation go out of gloomy economy. They pay nearly 80 billion dollars for tuition. 

So treat these guys equally!That is wholly right!
