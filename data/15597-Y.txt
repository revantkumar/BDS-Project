In my opinion, this policy is not only good for the immigrant, but also good for America itself. First, as we can see, this policy is applied for only those high-tech and high-professional majors, this would ensure the people will stay longer in America must have above-average quality. They got the chance to work here longer, and they also can contribute a major part of tax for government. Secondly, a lot of technology company, like Google and Apple, hired a lot immigrant with F1 visa. And these people contributed a lot to these company. Because of these people, America company can become the world leader, not only in technology, but also in finance industry. If the OPT only has 12 months, then these big company will lose a lot of people. Of course, a lot of native Americans also have these knowledge and skills and can do the work really well. But without the huge amount immigrants, can these company still the world leader in the future? I doubt.
