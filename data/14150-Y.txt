New rule prosposed regarding STEM OPT extension cancellation will not bring any kind of profit to USA nor to international students. It's just simple calculation,if the international students are made leave the country it will definitely effect the economy of USA. Everyone knows that IT industry holds more than 35% of international employees including H1/OPT/CPT etc.. Knowing that H1 people are in safe position but opt and Cpt people losing their chance to survive and gain expirence in IT industry will directly impact on new students coming to gain masters degree and also the one who is about to graduate in year 2016 and so.

I am pretty sure DHS is very well aware of how IT industry in United States work. 

Hence concluding my comment by not supporting this rule. 

Hope DHS will wave this rule, for good of everyone and the country.
