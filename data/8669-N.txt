As an American citizen and Retired MILITARY l am angered and disgusted with our government and agencies of that we would be considering this action and any others that would offer our jobs to immigrants over citizens. Our elected officials are supposed to be representing the citizens of this country not the few businesses that want cheaper labor.. l would love to see the elected officials of this country just once actually the citizens.
