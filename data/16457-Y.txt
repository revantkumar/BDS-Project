This is a very good initiative giving the brightest students from all over the world to unleash their potential with out worrying about the immigration status as soon as they graduate. I think this kind of decisions made by government is one of the reasons what make America the most powerful country in the world, having an open mind to welcome experts all over the world, other than just blindly protect local people. I have to say that outstanding people will have good opportunity and will not be influenced by the technical foreigners.
