I think this policy is good and I SUPPORT the proposal. I believe The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. 

I am working in Memphis and some international employees are working in my group, they are not taking jobs away from the US citizens, instead they make the whole group more efficient with their graduated level of knowledge. and when the company runs better and smoother, actually we provide more positions and employments to the society.
