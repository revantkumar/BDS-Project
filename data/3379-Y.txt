I am supportive of the 24 months OPT extension because, more than any other country, The US has to retain Technical talent within the country. This can only happen if International students who are good at what they do be encouraged to stay back and contribute to the economy. For us the US is not only a land of opportunity but also a place where entrepreneurship is thriving. By helping international talent to stay back, the Government can ensure that it is technically on par with other developed countries and stays competitive in the field of information technology. 

I would however suggest that we do not need the training and mentorship program as it would demoralize the employers from choosing the best talent out there due to paper work which might be waste of time and effort.
