Josie Niu It is unjust and shortsighted to deprive international students' legal rights to finish their practical training in the US after graduation. 

STEM are extremely critical fields for the US to ace at in order to maintain its leading position in the world. With STEM extension, international students will be able to devote more to scientific research, technology improvement, entrepreneurship and many other fields that empower and create jobs for the country they serve for. 

More importantly, continuing the OPT extension is not granting working visa, therefore, would have very little impact on increasing the competition in the US job market.
