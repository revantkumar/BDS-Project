When an international student comes to a country for getting higher education,he / she comes with a purpose of not only getting the theoretical knowledge of the specific field but also the hands on experience on real world project. Even if they do many projects as a part of curriculum during their graduate study; they still do not feel comfortable working on real time environment and sometime end up in a situation where they just hold a graduate degree ( A piece of paper which lacks in practical aspects of the knowledge ).

OPT is a standerd platform that provides the solution to above situation . It not only gives student a stage to understand and implement his / her field specif knowledge in business but it also provide an opportunity to develop his/ her business skills among professionals.

I TRUELY SUPPORT STEM OPT EXTENSION proposed rule since it will provide a wide window of time for international student to achieve their actual goals of getting the real world business experience at the international corporate firms.

Lots of thanks to the authority panel who are working for this rule in favor of international students.
