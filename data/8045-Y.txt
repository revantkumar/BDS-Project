I strongly support this proposal.

As an undergraduate student in China who is looking forward to studying aboard, USA and UK are under my consideration since both countries have great universities. 

I prefer USA since I could have enough time to practice what I learn with OPT extension. If there is no more OPT extension, I will choose UK since I can get my equal valued degree faster. A lot of my friends also have the same idea. 

When I think of USA, every man born equal will come in my mind. Also USA is a nation combined by different kind of people. In my point of view, this proposal is great for both USA and STEM students. STEM students contribute a lot to technical companies, they are also great consumers. Imagine how much money USA could make from their tuition, shopping, traveling and also their tax. And for myself, I really like the OPT extension program since I want to gain experience.
