I strongly support this rule for the reasons below.

1. There must be some reasons why some areas are full of foreigners instead of Americans. Since from the perspective of employers, there is no many Americans as skillful as foreign employees would like work for them for that salary.

2. In terms of education, US is much more attractive for foreign students than some European countries because the policy of OPT which could offer working experience to students who choose US. US always seen as the most active and attractive for talent people all over the world, without OPT, US may loose some people who concentrate experience.

3. To extend OPT for eligible STEM degrees F-1 students has no business with immigration. Since majority of these students may come from developing country which means their homeland has more opportunities for people who has STEM degree, however, the only thing they need is longer working experience. Thus, for American employers, they could pay less to have more work done efficiently; for these foreign students, they could accumulate working experience which is necessary for their future career. It is a win-win situation.
