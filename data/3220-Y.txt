I strongly support the proposal for several reasons. Firstly, recent years with rapidly growing of IT related economics, the demand of intelligent engineers and researches in technical fields increases simultaneously. In many giant companies, such as Google, Apple and Amazon, international students play a significant role and bring plenty of positive effects. While the OPT extension gives them higher opportunities to stay in the U.S rather than forcing to leave after a short period, they will definitely bring more contribution to American economy. Secondly, as thousands of international students come to the U.S. for studying each year, they become an essential part of American society. To promote the diversity of the society, the government have responsibility to encourage them to stay and also accept the differences. Last but not least, people all have equal rights to work in their favorite place and pursue their happiness. We diligent people deserve the harvest in our dream land instead of being discriminated by local people owing to our skin color. We have the equal rights to be hired and to fulfill our career endeavors.
