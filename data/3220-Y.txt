YANG WANG I strongly advocate the new regulation and believe it will bring a stronger workforce to the US high-tech market and boost the US economy significantly.

First of all, on average, an F1 master student spends about 50K to 70K USD (including tuition) during their study, for an undergraduate student, the number even doubles. At 2012, there is 5,00,000 F1 visa issued, means more than 2.5M dollars were spent by those students on the US soil. The primary reason the US could become the major destination for international students is the OPT program. If the OPT extension program is cut, we can very likely see a significant loss of consuming power for the US.

Second, today the innovative technology has become a powerful stimulation for the US economy. To secure the first position in the war of technology advancement, the US needs more well-trained STEM workers. In essence, the war of advancing technology is the war of high-tech workers. As we know the H1B visas are becoming more and more competitive and insufficient, having the STEM OPT Extension program is crucial for the US to get the best tech worker around the world and, therefore, be able to stay at the first place in the global economy. 

Third but the most important, the H1B workers ( which primarily come from the STEM F1 students ) bro 60 billion dollars tax revenue for the US government at 2015, and the tax money would be used to sponsor many public programs such like Medicare and public educations for the benefit of the American people.
