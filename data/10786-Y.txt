I strongly agree to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and CapGap relief for all eligible F-1 students. Foreign students in STEM degrees has greatly contributed to the progress of research and development of related areas. It filled demands of high technology workers in the US, and significantly contributed to the prosperous of US economy which sequentially created many more job opportunities. Without the STEM foreign students, many job positions will left empty and we won't see the prosperous economy which, to a large extent, is due to the development of emerging high technologies like smart phones, big data, etc. We will not see how these new techs have changed our world. 

Improving and expanding the training opportunities of F-1 students will provide them more opportunities to contribute to US technology and economy development, which will in turn benefit all the Americans. Therefore I strongly agree to the proposal.
