I definitely support the extension. Empolying excellent international students in the STEM area are extremely important for high-tech companies in U.S. to perform better than their comparators from other parts of the world. The growth of these U.S. high-tech companies will create more job opportunities for U.S. citizens in other areas because the economy will go up. If there is no extension, a lot of excellent engineers will not be able to work in U.S. and they will join the high-tech companies in their home country.
