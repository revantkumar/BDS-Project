Fred Lee I stongly support the Rule for the following reasons:
1. A lot of international students benefit from great amount of US grants for science and technology. It is a great and immediate loss to US government and people if only allow those students to serve US for 12 months. 
2. Those STEM students almost all experienced high education in US acdemics. They are legal tax payers and contribute to the economy as much as, if not more, than citizens. 
3. The Rule gives the US universities an edge in attracting high quality students from other countries. There are othe countries provide good education but without a professional training period, like UK. In order to get more professional training, I chose US as the place to receve my high level degree.
