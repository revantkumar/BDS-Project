I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S after graduation. 
2. Human resources are the engine of a sustainable economic growth especially in the technology sector. Think of Google , Facebook and any other major technology firms would not have achieved so much without the foreign talents contribution in the back office. Furthermore, there are large amount of areas where foreign tablets can shine but not many Americans would be willing to take the jobs. 
3. The market and supply rule. STEM extension serves as a platform for the market supply to meet the labor demand in terms of foreign talents. If they are highly beneficial to the firms or the American society, the HRs would identify those the good ones and keep them, which eventually are for the betterment of the U.S society in general.
