I strongly support this proposed rule by DHS. OPT is a great way for F-1 nonimmigrant students to gain extensive training in the field of study after their graduation from a U.S. college, and directly contribute to U.S. economy and help U.S. to remain extremely competitive in the world. Yet one year period is severely limited, both for the students who want to work in a U.S. corporate and the companies that are willing to take in these international students and spend time and money training them. An extension to this training period for F-1 students is extremely beneficial for both the students and U.S. corporations. I am glad that DHS recognized this benefit and proposed this revised rule.
