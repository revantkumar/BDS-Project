I strongly agree with improving and expanding OPT for F-1 STEM students.
Expanding OPT will benefit the economy growth in U.S. to a great extent. According to NAFSAs latest economic analysis, international students contributed almost $27 billion dollars to the U.S. economy in 2014 and more than one in three international students in the U.S. were enrolled in STEM.Thus, for innovation and economy concern, expanding OPT is definitely a good proposal.
