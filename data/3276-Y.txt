Josh Yu OPT IS ESSENTIAL FOR STUDENTS, US HIGHER EDUCATION, AND US ECONOMY 

The US has seen a high influx of international students within the past decade and without a doubt, these students have contributed greatly to the American society. Many of them have become leading scientists, entrepreneurs, and community leaders after their studies. Many of them embrace the American values and strive for excellence in their communities. Meanwhile universities have been enjoying high enrollment rates and both large and small enterprises have benefitted from a steady stream of capable and skilled workers. Clearly international students have become an essential part of the American lives. 

The proposed regulations would not only preserve the wonderful benefits that we are enjoying right now from granting work authorizations to international students, but also allow them to contribute more to the US economy by extending those work authorizations. I believe this is a win win situation of everyone.
