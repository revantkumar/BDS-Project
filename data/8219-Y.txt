Linda Parnell I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens. As a tech worker myself, I can verify that wages in my field have been mostly flat for years now. I fear that if I lose my current job, I may not be able to find another one, and if I do, it will be for less than I'm making now. The government needs to stand up for American citizens for a change.
