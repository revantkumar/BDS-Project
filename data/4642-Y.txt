As for myself, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
Firstly, as far as I am concerned, high tech companies has brought huge economic benefits to the United States, and engineers in STEM areas are still not adequate to the demand. Thousands of international students with have high educational background will definitely fill the gap between the demand and supply. Thus, without doubt, it will boost overall economic development of the USA.
Moreover, if international students are forced to go back to their home country after graduation immediately, they will probably choose not to continue their study in the USA since we don't have the chances to get into the real industry.
What's more, international students will decrease the employment rate of native students, since every one has the same process to be employed. If you are not capable of being employed, no matter where are you from, you will not be considered. 
In general, I strongly believe it is a beneficial policy to both international students and the United States.
