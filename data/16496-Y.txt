This is a great idea! Training opportunities are very important to STEM students because it will help them to gain hands on experience and have a better understanding in their fields. Students with STEM degrees will make more contributions to the U.S. if they can stay here for a longer time. After the training, they will bring the expertise to their home countries all around the world, which expand the impact of the U.S. education.
