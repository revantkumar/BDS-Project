I am strongly opposed to any job specific visas until and unless the potential employer can prove there are no qualified candidates who are already US citizens. There are simply too many people who are unemployed (I have been unemployed since March of this year), underemployed or would like a job but have simply given up on finding one and are no longer counted as unemployed.
