The idea that they take jobs from Americans is just a rumor and misunderstanding. Throughout the history, immigrants have made this country stronger and richer. Although some jobs are taken initially, more jobs are created in the long run in this country by the stimulated economy. If legal immigration never existed, you wouldn't be American today. Therefore, OPT should be there to continue letting in good talented people!
