I'm a graduate student in Dartmouth College, pursuing a master degree in computer science. I love this field. I crave for new technologies which can be realized by implementing brilliant ideas. I always believe that science should not have any boundary or restriction by different countries or cultures. We ought to unite our great minds together to make the world a better place, instead of tearing us apart with some political conflicts. I want to have the chance to make a difference in America and meet different talented people and contribute to the world together. Extending OPT really helps me realize this dream of mine, which is also the same dream of other students from all over the world. We came here with enthusiasm towards science and we should have a better opportunity to stay here and devote our talents. It's not just a political decision. It's a step towards gathering smart and talented people all over the world to generate something great and fantastic. I genuinely hope we can make the world a better place TOGETHER!
