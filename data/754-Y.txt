Charles Easlon The ICEB proposed rule to improve training opportunities for Nonimmigrant Students with STEM degrees is NOT a good idea. Now is a time when recent U.S.STEM graduates are having a difficult time finding jobs in their chosen fields. This proposed rule would end up making it cheaper for employers to hire foreign STEM students than it would to hire U.S. STEM graduates. Financially they would have to do this and this would make it even harder for U.S. STEM students to find work in their chosen fields. This rule would give U.S. STEM students even less chance to develop their careers. The ICEB should not be undermining the future of the United States.
