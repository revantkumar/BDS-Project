1) Hiring international students doesn't mean to lower wage for citizens. Tech companies hire international students not because they will accept lower wage, but because their talent in their area that can be help the company. The company is spending more money on an OPT student then an US citizen! Sponsoring H1B visa, hiring immigration attorneys, both cost money. You cannot blame others when you are having trouble to secure a job. It's not easy for a foreign student to get a job in US. Most of them go back to their home country. Those who can obtain a job are the most competitive ones, with high degree, grades, skills and talent. 2) International students are helping create jobs and contribute to the country's economy growth. Landlords can get a higher rent income because of international students. New stores will open in areas with many students, also create new jobs. An international student comes to the US, paying higher tuition and fees. If he or she has income, he or she is also paying tax to IRS. However, if he or she has dependents, he or she cannot claim tax allowance like citizens, thus paying high tax than an US citizen with the same circumstances.
