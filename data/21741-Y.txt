I strongly support this extension rule. International STEM students will help to ensure the competition of US academic sector and industry sector. These students are the elite of foreign countries. If this rule cannot pass, these people will go to other countries which will potentially harm the national interest of US. For example for me, I got multiple choice before coming to US for pursuing my PhD study. Some countries offers better treatment than US. I come to US because of the training opportunity.
More international students will promote the US economy and create a lot of job opportunities for US workers. We cannot stay in the US forever. Also, We often do no come alone. Our family and friends often visit us during the study which becomes a big incentive to US economy.
Extending OPT to 24 months is very necessary. Many current projects in industry and academic fileds last several years. The employer cannot hire international student with one-year OPT. Thus, solely 12 months OPT will result in less big, impactive projects in the future due to lacking of suitable researcher.
