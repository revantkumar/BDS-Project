James Lee I am so upset to see the arguments which are popular (but not true) in many comments here:
"It denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
It removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds."
These arguments are badly biased.
A few other factors would need to be added for this to come close to a valid accounting:
--While nothing is paid into Social Security or Medicaid, there also are no benefits earned.
--Much of the work done will be in Federally funded university research, and if there actually are any salary savings, they accrue to the taxpayers.
--Many on OPT will be continuing research they themselves started, and no one else, native or foreign, will be a good substitute.
--At least some working on OPT's will become compliments in the labor market to differently skilled natives, thus creating native jobs.
--While working in the United States, anyone on OPT will be buying goods and services from the U.S. economy.
--New knowledge created from their research can have positive global economic effects, but the there are definite additional advantages to the United States of the knowledge being created here.
