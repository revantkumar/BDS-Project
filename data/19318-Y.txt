I highly SUPPORT this ruling. US should try its best to keep world talent!

I am a professor work in a university. I have been working in admission committee for several years. Recent year we approve an increasing number of students from Asian countries. The reason is not because we favor of Asian students but it is undeniable that top candidates are not from US schools. 

If we don't have OPT the students may choose to go to other countries like Canada. In spite of financial loss, I highly doubt if US could have high quality professors in academic institutions.
