As an F1 STEM student, I would say it's really important for us to have the OPT time in order to learn more here. I came all the way to the states, I am not just looking for a little bit fun here, I am looking for more, knowledge, experience. I want to be a better person, at least someone I want to be.
STEM is the most important industry in the world and the states have the best resource here, I think most of the STEM F1 students here, not only learn a lot from OPT experience but also give more creative thoughts to the states. 
We come from different place all around the world. Just with the diversity background, we can get more different ideas and make something real in the field. 
Let us learn more, let us experience more and let us give more.
