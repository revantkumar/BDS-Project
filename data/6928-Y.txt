Optional Practical Training (OPT)is unfair to citizen students and NOT NEEDED to fill any gap in STEM employment. 1) If the case is made that we need more STEM graduates, provide the incentives for our own youth to train. 2)Every job awarded to an F-1 nonimmigrant student displaces a citizen THAT COULD BE TRAINED for the position. 3)The H1B program and OPT by expansion is simply a scheme to provide LOW COST labor to domestic employers. 4)Harris Corp in Lynchburg VA recently eliminated 80 positions, all to be replaced by a combination of new H1B and offshore employees. 5)I teach technology at local community college and see every day STEM graduates who cannot find employment in their field.
