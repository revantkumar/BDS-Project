I strongly agree with this rule for the following reasons:

1. Keep talented and well-educated students in the US is good for the country's economy. Especially under the trend that IT area is developing very fast.

2. It is the US spirit to give everyone a chance, this is exactly what equality means.

3. Longer opt will attract more brilliant students studying in the US, which will do good to the country's education.
