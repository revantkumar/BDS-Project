I strongly agree the proposal for the following reasons.

1. OPT student in STEM fields are not, and will never become, vicious competitors of American college students. It is not true that companies prefer OPT students. On the contrary, if they can get american students, they will be happier to get them in, because they know that foreign students working permission are temporary. So only if no citizens meet the hiring bar, they will hire foreign students. Also, a lot of STEM job can't be applied by foreign students, they are reserved for citizens.

2. Foreign students pay a lot more tuitions to universities than citizens. The money foreign students give, is a important resource for universities income. And then it can help citizens to receive good education with very low tuition fee. If students don't have OPT extension, many students may not choose US as their destination for going aboard, which will lead to less income for university, which will definitely influence the education citizens can get then.
