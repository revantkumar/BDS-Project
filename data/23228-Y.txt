I highly agree with this improvement for and expanding training opportunities for F-1 STEM students in the United States to extend the OPT period by 24 months. The extension would help STEM students apply their academic knowledge in a working setting and be prepared for careers in the future. In addition, this extension would also help ensure that the nation's colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States.

Over all, the extension would be mutual-benefit for both United States and international STEM students.
