To some arguments in this forum,

1) OPT doesn't offer the job. It's the employers who make the hiring/firing decisions. And Americans already have an advantage in this respect because employers generally want to avoid legal hassle.

2) Remember that international students also CREATE jobs, such as university jobs. It's just a matter of which sectors of the economy will benefit from international students (and which sectors suffer).

3) Overall, if U.S. wants to compete globally with technology advantage, OPT extension is in the right direction.
