The OPT extension for STEM students looks great for the future of the country. In STEM fields, we depend on too much on these students. Our education is so failed that there are less than 20% native citizens who study engineering in graduate school like computer science. If OPT students are forced to go back to their home country like India, Russia which are competitor country for us, US technology will be catched up by them. 

I notice that many people complain that american citizen lose job because of OPT students. These people seems forget that citizens are much easier to get jobs than international students.
