I strongly support this rule for the following two reasons. Firstly, extending the OPT duration can definitely attract more and more talented international students (with specialized expertise) working for the America. This has significant impact on American's leadership in the field of, high-tech companies and academic institutions. We cannot ignore the fact that those international OPT students have contributed a lot to the high-tech development in past years. The second reason is, we have been emphasizing the AMERICAN SPIRIT all the way. Specifically, American Spirit aims to provide everyone equal chance. Those talented international students deserve some time to practice. If we do not even give them a chance to practice and show their talent, how can we say we are living with AMERICAN SPIRIT?
