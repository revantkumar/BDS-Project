Laura Muhleck I do not support any program that takes away from American workers and gives to workers from other nations. I don't care if the worker is going back to their home country or worse yet staying here and taking away one of our jobs. This nation is in terrible debt and we need to start thinking about decreasing the debt. There should be no other choice or question or debate in the matter. Any debate in the matter is ludicrous. Thank you
