I strongly support OPT extension because I hold strong belief in EQUALITY that makes America a positive and attractive country for people around the world, and not only because I am an international student myself before. We fight our way through and studied hard to get the great opportunity to study in Universities here and after graduate from the school, we need enough OPT time to keep improving our skills and really helps the technology to grow. 
At the same time, more companies are going to thrive as the big talent pool formed by both American and international graduates. With more growing companies, more job opportunities will be created instead of less. 
China used to be locked down by the government during early Qing Dynasty with believing it is strong enough as one reason. Then it easily get surpassed. It is always not a good idea to block everyone else and trying to keep the good, if one want to stay strong.
