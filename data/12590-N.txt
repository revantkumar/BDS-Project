I oppose the ICEB rule because it is detrimental to the productivity of American employees (allowing foreigners to take OUR jobs) and corporate welfare. Therefore, not a positive for the United States of America. We need to put Americans back to work. The unemployment rate is a lie and there are too many underemployed people in the workforce.
