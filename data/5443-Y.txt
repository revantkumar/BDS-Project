I completely and strongly support this proposed rule and I have the following reasons:

1. Major projects requires a substantial amount of time to complete. Were international student to lose their working status during the meantime, it would cost the company/organization greatly. If such case happens frequently and on a large scale, U.S. economy could be impaired. Current OPT time which is only 12 months is too short for any research or industry projects. 

2. Having an OPT extension of 19 months was the biggest attraction for international students or they could practice what they learn and thus bring values to American companies. If extension were to be canceled, the country should expect an enormous decline in number of international students, which would be very much disadvantageous for global impact, reputation, and influence of U.S. universities.

3. International students are clearly making big contributions to various industries especially the technology industry. IT giants are filled with talents from around the globe. Cutting their staying time will bring tremendous impact to those fields and even U.S. economy. 

4. International students deserve same working rights as local students.
