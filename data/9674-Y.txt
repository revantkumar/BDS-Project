We face to choose school to continue the high education for our kids. the current U.S. staying policy for international STEM students has been lacking the competitiveness than other countries. only attractiveness left to the parent of international STEM student is the reputation of the U.S. high education. if the policy you mentioned is shortened, we definitely don't want to support our children for the choice of U.S. high education.
