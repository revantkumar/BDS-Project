Yudan Lu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

Firstly, it is a good opportunity for international students who have studied in the U.S. to contribute to the country. All the students need a period of time to be accustomed to their jobs. It is really hard to dig deep into a field and make great contributions to the U.S. in just 12 months.

Secondly, competition is beneficial to selecting better talented people and improving abilities of all employees. It will also enhance the worldwide competitiveness of the U.S.

Thirdly, it wont affect the employment of native people. The number of jobs in the fields involved in the proposal is far beyond the number of job seekers. And the current situation is that it is difficult to find native people to do these jobs. On the other hand, since the number of h1b wont change, the number of people who will finally stay in the U.S. will remain unchanged.
