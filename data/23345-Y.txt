I believe that expanding training opportunities will be beneficial for the greater good of america.. As it has always been, immigrants have been a major strength of America's economy. And extension of training period will only strengthen it further. Moreover opportunities seem valid only if they land in the hands of the deserving rather than in the hands of somebody who just got lucky.
