As some comments mentioned that students worked with OPT were paid less, so the employer would hire the foreign students over domestic, that was totally not the case in my previous company. I worked with OPT, and I was paid the same as another U.S. intern who had the same position as me. The only reason they hired me over other U.S. candidate was that I was better qualified. I had relative experience and near perfect GPA. It makes no sense by accusing foreign students for taking too many jobs. There are many restrictions applied on OPT to prevent that.
