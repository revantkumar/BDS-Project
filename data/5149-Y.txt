Charmagne Herlien Docket No. ICEB-2015-0002
RIN 1653-AA72
Please see attached comments as they are longer than the 5000 characters allowed in this text box. 

In sum, I support the proposed rule confirming the Cap Gap and extending STEM OPT to 24 months and offer several suggestions for specific improvements as well as pleas for attention to certain areas such as the Mentoring and Training Plan and allow for training, implementation and ongoing STEM OPT eligibility for those that have EAD cards valid beyond the court date of February 12, 2016. These students are currently living with an uncertain future for both their employment and immigration status.
