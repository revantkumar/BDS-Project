I strongly support expanding training opportunities for F-1 non immigrant students with STEM degree and cap-gap relief for all F-1 students. US has been an immigrant country from the very beginning. New waves of immigrants have always pushed US ahead and helped US stay ahead. All the Polish, Irish and Italian etc. immigrants were all given the opportunities to come and stay in the US and the US society as a whole have benefited greatly from their contributions. I believe these F-1 students would do the same by researching new drugs, creating new businesses and paying more taxes.
