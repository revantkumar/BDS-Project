I wholeheartedly support this proposal because I believe immigrants that have received higher education in this country, especially STEM majors, contribute significantly to the US economy and the tax revenues, help create jobs and advance technology development. The current cap on H1B visas is hurting the economy and technology development by pushing talents away. Many fresh graduates with PhD degrees leave the country and work elsewhere, not because they are not good enough for the US, not because they are not badly needed in the industry here, but simply because the odds are against them. 

Many argue that foreign workers will steal our jobs, which is simply not true. An overwhelming majority of these foreign workers are working in the industries where we don't have enough domestic supplies in the first place (simply check the number of domestic students who earned advanced degrees in Engineering, as opposed to the number of job openings in relevant field each year). Also relevant is the fact the unemployment rate for American STEM majors with advanced degrees is very low, compared to the national average. This strongly suggests that STEM major immigrants are not going to take our jobs.

Having a 24 month extension would definitely help ease the current situation, as that'll give foreign workers a longer period to work for US companies and contribute to the US economy. For these reasons, I support the proposal for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees to get a 24 month extension, and for all students to get a cap gap relief.
