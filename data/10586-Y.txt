I am fully convinced that expanding the OPT program for international students will be beneficial for U.S economy. American institutions of higher education have invested a large amount of money and manpower into training these talented young people into well-qualified professionals. Therefore, they should be given the opportunity to give back to American society by applying their knowledge in the country.

In addition, expanding the OPT program will boost America as the top choice destination for international students. In a world where competition for talents are getting increasingly fierce, expansion of the OPT program will prove to be essential to establishing America as the hub of talent. Other developed countries such as Australia, Great Britain and Singapore all have similar program in place to attract the best and brightest to serve the country after they graduate from college.
