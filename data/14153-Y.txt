This new rule will be definitely beneficial to the economy and the international influence of the US in the world. 
The first beneficiary is institutions of higher education in US. This new rule would attract more STEM major students all over the world to pursue their advanced degrees in the US, which will highly increase the income of institutions. Moreover, all this students would contribute to the academy and research in the US. 
Secondly, the US employers will take advantages of this rules which allows STEM major students have more time to use their specific skills to benefit their employers. Also, by using the skilled students, the employers could reduce the time and costs that they spend on training. Furthermore, US has a large number of high-tech international companies, they would need to hire someone with international background to extend their business in the foreign countries. No doubt, students of STEM major are the great choice of them.
Thirdly, some people may think this rule would affect employment obtaining of the US citizens but I believe this will not happen because this OPT extension is time-limited and highly major selective. This rule avoids general occupations but point at specific fields that require some time and skills to accomplish. 
Overall, I believe there are more benefits than the drawbacks of this new rule.
