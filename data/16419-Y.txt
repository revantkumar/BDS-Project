Why am I seeing SO MANY haters???

I grew up in a small town of MI, went to college in NYC and worked for tech company in Cali. I see how immigrants with strong STEM skills and talents being dedicated to this country and what they have done to make themselves a part of the people who CONTRIBUTE, rather than the HATERS YELLING on the internet. America is MUCH, MUCH better off with the skilled immigrants than those WHO CAN BARELY READ and call themselves AMERICANS. I have many tech friends from France, China, Korea and Russia, they DESERVE to call themselves Americans than those Haters.

this proposal is one of the VERY FEW things that GOVT try to make it right, highly skilled STEM tech people make this country stay on the top while CHINA and RUSSIA are longing for those talents. 

Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy. 

GOD BLESS AMERICA
