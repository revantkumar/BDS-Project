Hi,
I think that allowing an extension to all foreign students and workers in the US would be a good idea. I know that it would impact my business life in a positive way because I work with several people that are directly effected by this, but aside from the selfish reason, I think it's not in the US economy's best interest to export so many young workers. These are largely people that put forth a lot of effort to come to the US in order to learn and work. They are dedicated, capable, and hard working. Having so many corporations need to fill those spots again would probably open up the job market a little bit, but the cost of hiring and training doesn't seem worth it.
