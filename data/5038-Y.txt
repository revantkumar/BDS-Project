Xianghong Li I believe that OPT extension policy will do good to both international students and USA. I hope that people who hold negative opinions will see the huge benefits from a more objective perspective because this policy will attract more international students. Take China for example, only in 2014, international students spent $9,800 millions on tuition in the USA, not to mention the huge amount of dollars their relative spent on visiting their kids and travelling in the USA.These stem students will meet the urgent demand of some American companies for professionals and skilled workers and help these American companies to make more profits, which will benefit America.
I would imagine there would be fewer students coming to USA if no working permits are gratned after graduation.After all, international students have many choices. Canda, Australia, Great Britain,even Singapore, Newsland and other European countries are competing with USA in attracting international students.
