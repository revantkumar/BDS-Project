I do strongly support the new proposal. As a structural engineer whose work is mostly forcus on the residential projects, our client include one of the biggest home remodeling company in united states, and they do appreciate our service as quick, economical and good coordination. We do cobtribute our strength to the slowly recovery of the house market as samll businesses after a shocking collapse of the great recession. I love this country and thus pursue to fufill my own american dream just like all other immigrants who come from all over the world during every time period after the establishment of this country. And I believe the founding fathers cliche for this country:We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness
