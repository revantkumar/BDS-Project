I support this rule for STEM students.
1.Thousands of STEM students will force to leave USA without it. They are highly skilled and well chosen work labors for American companies. 

2.They are execptional business creators,which may create millions of job opportunities for US citizens.

3. Sending them away will not save any job opportunity for US citizens, but will only benefit foreign companies.

Nowadays,the main competitors for job opportunities are not these foreign students, but the foreign companies outside USA.

If these students are not given any chance to work in US, they would work for those foreign companies, take away American companies' global business opportunities, and may eventually cause millions of layoffs in US.
