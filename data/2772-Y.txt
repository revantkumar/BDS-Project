shutong song I strongly support STEM extension. Let's think about how much money the universities spend each year on STEM students. Why do those universities do these? The first reason is most native Americans do not interested in those STEM fields. The second reason is because the US universities want to attract the talent students from the world. They pay the tuitions and train them with the high end knowledge and skills. The industry and research institute need those STEM students with those high end skills, it would be stupid to force them to leave after getting educated. One more thing to mention, the STEM students did not take the native Americans' job, because most Americans are not those major. On the contrary, letting STEM students working in the US will benefit industry and economy. I strongly support STEM extension.
