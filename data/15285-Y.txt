To Whom it may concern-

I am an American in Ohio. My fianc has a STEM degree & is currently employed as an engineer. We have been together for about two years. We plan on marrying in March of 2016. We are in a homosexual relationship. She is from China. It would be a huge challenge for is to live as a married couple in China. It would be especially hard for I, a lover of democracy, to live in China if you don't expand this opportunity for her. 

Please understand, consider and empathize for people such as us. We both want to live as a lesbian couple in America where we can live a normal life. This will not be possible if my fianc ends up back in China where homosexuality is not accepted.

Thank you for your time
