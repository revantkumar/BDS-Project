When is this country going to stop taking care of foreign students who come here and take care of its own. Foreign students can extend their visas and get mentoring and those students who ARE CITIZENS do not. Are you going to wait until this country is nothing but a country of illegals who want nothing more than to live by their own rules. Or better yet do you want these foreign college students to learn everything from us and turn around and take it back to their country and use it against us.
