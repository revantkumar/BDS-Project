I strongly SUPPORT OPT extension Because if OPT extension is canceled, not only more talented international students will leave USA, but American's education industry will be affected. Try to image that: even you graduate from top universities in USA, you hardly can find a good job. Will you choose to leave your home and study there? In this way, less talented students will choose to study and make contribute to America. This is a double lose.
