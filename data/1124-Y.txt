I strongly support this program! I own a small scale software company with 10 employees. Three of them are international students, trust me I really want to hire Americans initially while then I realize there are really limited number of qualified American candidates for my positions, it's impossible for my business to grow when there are only Americans available in job market and I can't afford to lose my employees, they do excellent jobs and it will cost me so much to train new guys, it just doesn't make any sense!
