I strongly support the proposal. The STEM students contribute a lot to USA as fresh blood. USA is a country based on intelligence from the world. For example, digital companies like GOOGLE and FACEBOOK, have many STEM non-immigration students working there. STEM students are the treasury for the country. It is unfair for them who accepted the advanced education in USA, but have no rights working here. Also, it is unfair for employers to loose their valuable human resource assets just because of political issues.

The country needs them!
