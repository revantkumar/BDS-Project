I hope the DHS will consider extending the STEM OPT extension to a lot more than 24 months. I hope the DHS will reconsider the 6 year extension that it had proposed earlier instead of bowing to pressure from an individual senator; one from a state that does not have a viable technology industry. The STEM OPT gives students valuable time to put into practice and internalize the learnings from their course of study in complex fields. It also gives students enough time to evaluate whether they would like to continue to work in the US by seeking an immigration visa. With the rise of global competition for STEM talent in recent decades it is in the US's best interest to relax entry requirements for talented graduates from US universities into the US technology industry.
