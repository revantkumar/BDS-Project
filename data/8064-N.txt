I am tired of hearing that there are jobs Americans will not do.
There are enough qualified Americans who can do these jobs, but employers are able to pass over Americans since they prefer to pay foreign workers less.

Please tell me, how does this benefit the USA when we have too many unemployed people?
We need more Americans working and paying taxes.

Why doesn't the government focus more about education and training for Americans then about giving jobs to foreign workers?
