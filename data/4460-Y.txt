Andrew Chu America makes me confused. It welcome refugee but refuse 2/3 of international students well educated. The H1 B quato policy, in fact, just hurts America whether in short-run or long-run. Please stop this stupid quato policy and allow international students live and work in America freely. After all, there are just about 240,000 graduates every year. They can't influence common Americans jobs.
