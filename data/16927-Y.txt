Strongly endorse this proposed rule with the following four reasons.
1. From the foundation of United States, diversity is one of the most important factors that help US stand highly among all countries. International student is in my opinion the largest source of diversity for the US's competitiveness. If no students entering job market result from OPT STEM program, the US would be much less competitiveness in high-tech fields.
2. Most of the projects in STEM fields are a long period of time due to the complexity and importance, so the duration of OPT less than 24 months would lead the project unmanaged. Most of the projects in software development companies are more than several years, if the OPT students have to leave US due to OPT duration, it would be a disaster for the company and make the companies lose lots of profits.
3. As an international student, the experience we gain in US company will help the company expand to the global much more easily. For instance, Facebook is now actively entering China's market. If no international employees from China due to OPT duration, this campaign would be much harder.
4. The longer an international student stays in US, the more he/she would pay for living expense, which in return helps boost the US economy. Take myself as an example, during my stay in US, I have spent much money in housing, car expense, food, travelling etc. If all the international students leave US instantly after completion of degree without OPT STEM program, all these spending would be 0.
