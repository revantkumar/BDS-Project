I highly welcome this new change of STEM OPT Extension rule. 

History during the past few decades has showed how the influx of foreign intellectual powers have been a critical factor for the revolutionary development in science, technology and economy. Examples would include more than 20 Nobel Prize Winners since 2000, Yahoo's co-founder Jerry Yang, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai, and CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella. 

Moreover, this rule would help US companies to be able to recruit much-needed employees in STEM fields. Most foreign students provide solid technology backgrounds, innovative ideas, and solid work ethics to employers. 

Most importantly, the innovation created by foreigners would create more jobs, instead of taking jobs away from US citizens.
For example, statistics showed that each foreign worker holding H-1B visa would create 5 jobs in the United States. This would generally apply to the case of F-1 students with STEM degrees.
