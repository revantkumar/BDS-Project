I strongly support the proposed expansion of the OPT expansion plan for nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. In the past decade or so, more and more foreign students are drawn to the United States for higher education because it is the place where the best educational resources are available and the most cutting-edge technologies are being developed. It is indisputable that innumerable foreign students, equipped with the skills they've obtained during their academic career in the US, have joined different fields and made remarkable contributions to academic research and different industries. A lot of these foreign students, bright and hardworking, have undeniably become an important component of the workforce in this country, especially in the STEM areas. Therefore, the new OPT extension, if approved, will definitely help these students to continue to have access to a diverse range of opportunities, where they are able to make more contributions to the advancement of technologies and academic research and help develop this country, which benefited them in the first place.
