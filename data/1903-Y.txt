We came to United States to pursue knowledge, seek fair human rights. We study, we work in school or as interns legally, and we pay taxes when we work! Because of the freedom, fair human rights, and higher tech knowledge, many of us wants to stay and work for some years after we graduate. We need the expanding training opportunities so we have enough time to seek for jobs, and gain proper working experiences in the states. One year OPT is not enough! Not enough for finding a job, not enough for get the job in time so we can apply for a drawing chancing in April to change to H1B if we want to stay longer. No company wants to hire a person can only work several months, specially for newly graduated students, it's not worth to train and spend money on someone who can only work for one or two months after you fully trained them. That is why, we need more than one year of OPT, we need the expansion!!! Show the freedom, show the fairness!
