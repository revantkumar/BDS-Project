Rosie Qiao I fully support this proposal. This proposal will not harm any American to find jobs. The companies involved in E-verify already prove they're equal to everyone. If we suppose all of the American new graduates get jobs in STEM area, there're still a lot of job openings. Without this proposal and proper VISA, international student could not fill in those jobs and help the companies in STEM area to develop new technology. If this proposal got rejected, it means to shut down it's own economics and I don't think it's a wise decision.
