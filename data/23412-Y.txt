First of all, I I strongly support this proposal.
I have to say wether this proposal is approved or not really does not affect prospective futures of thousands of foreign students who are currently studying in America. As far as I know, most of students who came to America are the top level in their own countries. They can always go back to their own countries to purse a better career before they try to make contributions to the US. Looking back on the history of the United States of America, we can figure out that the secrets that US can be the leading country in this world are the continuous attractions for the most talent people. But I have to say that we are losing this advantage rapidly because of the following two reasons. One is that the emerging countries like India, and China develop very very fast in recent decades of years. Compared to them, US is giving away its leading position in this world. Meanwhile, most foreign students come from these two countries. If we cannot keep these top students work in US, they will go back. Secondly, more and more people in US do not welcome foreign students and they even thought the reason they do not have jobs are because of these talent students. I feel very sad for these poor people. On behalf of the US, we have to focus on the long-term benefits instead of short-term ones. What really matters is how to keep US's leading position in this world now and in the future.
