I strongly support this OPT extension .
I'm an international student, every year, I have to pay 46,000 for just tuition ! If add up the expense for daily life, it would cost me more than 70,000 per year ! If we want to travel around US in holiday, we have to spend another several thousands ! As far as I know we international students have been significantly contributing to US both in the payment of tuition and other expenditures in this country's economy. Because of our expenditure we created lots of employment, we stimulate US academic level, real estate, tourism, fast moving consumable products industry, etc
According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. Especially for public colleges and universities , we pay much more compared to the tuition paid by in-state students !
Without international students contribution, I don't think there gonna be many jobs for US citizens, and without the OPT program extension, I don't think students would still want to spend so much in this country to pursue a degree, there are so many world class universities we can choose outside the US.
