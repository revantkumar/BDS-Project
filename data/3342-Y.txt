1. STEM students do their job just fine. They got their job not because their wage is low. They compete with everyone else. It's all fair game.
2. Students got rejected on job offers only because they don't have enough time left on OPT to work for the company
3. They are not replaceable. We are talking about computer science, math, statistics. Tons of skills only they are capable of. You can not find some one to do a decent job without certain training and experience.
4. This is not for GREEN CARD. They just want more experience to work at an better environment, like more advanced equipment, more advanced techniques. They work very hard to contribute, to compete with colleague, who doesn't need to be asked question like do you need sponsorship in the near future.
5. There's tons of ILLEGAL immigrants out there. That needs to be taken care of. Here we are talking about highly educated, special skills equipped STEM students. They should be able to work at the place they like, legally.
