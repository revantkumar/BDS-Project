At the office where I work, all the entry level IT jobs are reserved for students on OPT! This is because they cost less due to my employer not having to pay the employer share of Social Security. This is unfair to all the American STEM graduates students who are not even allowed to compete for these jobs. If American STEM college graduates are closed from these entry level jobs, where are they supposed to get experience?

Please abandon this horrible OPT program for foreign STEM students and give our college grads a chance to start their careers in the field they love.
