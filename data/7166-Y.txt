Fang He OPT and OPT extension will be good for the USA and international students. I strongly support it.

OPT and OPT extension will increase competitiveness for American universities, American companies, and regular American citizens. 

For American companies, a longer OPT and OPT extension will bring about more talented international students, who get American style education in the USA, to American universities and colleges for a period of time. Such talented international students will help American companies increase profits, benefits, patents, and job opportunities. 

For example, one of three co-founders of Yahoo! is an international student from Taiwan, and currently CEO of Google is also an intentional student. Such high-profile talents create so many money and job opportunities for regular American citizens and American employees. Also they obtain a big reputation for American universities, American education system, and more importantly, the USA.
