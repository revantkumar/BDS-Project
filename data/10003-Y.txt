I strongly support STEM OPT extension to 24 months. In fact i would prefer it to be extended to 36 months in the current H1 Lottery scenario where the probability of getting your application for H1 picked is 1/4.

Imagine the life of an International student who comes to US with lot of hopes for better education. In the process he also accumulates a huge debt in the form of Student loans. It is fair on US government side to provide him an opportunity to work and improve his academic knowledge from the STEM degree.

Apart from the above, STEM students can also greatly contribute to the economy of the country by becoming work force for tech firms in the US.
