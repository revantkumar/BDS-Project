I am a international student,I am pursuing a STEM degree in business analytics.
The STEM students are increasing, bringing with tuituion and guraduation fees and staying expenses and other education revenue the US is receiving. US universities and colleges will be badly affected if the OPT STEM extension is not retained and expanded to 24 months. Most of the US universities and colleges will shut their doors if the OPT extension is not given, because student will choose other countries for higher education.
Also, students will contribute to the growth of US economy by paying Taxes on their exployment.
