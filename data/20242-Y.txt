I strongly support this new rule for the following reasons:

Firstly,international students contribute billions of dollars per year to the US economy. 24 months OPT extension will allow them to work longer in US, which means making more contribution to US economy, and further creating more jobs.

What's more, this rule will attract more international students to pursue higher education in US, helping US universities to get more funding in term of tuition fees. They get overseas experience, and universities make money, This is really a win-win strategy.

Last but not least, each year the number of H1B visa spots is fixed - 85,000. Longer OPT won't change this truth. Also the IT companies hire more international students because not a lot Americans are willing to do programming related work. In that case, foreigners are not depriving US citizens of job opportunities.

In a word, STEM students bring money, skills and jobs. As a country founded based on immigration, US should embrace this variety.
