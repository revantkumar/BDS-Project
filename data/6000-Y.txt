I support this new rule for OPT extension with no doubt. It benefits the country in many ways. The STEM international students help US to hold the leading position in many aspects which is very important to the future of the country. The new rule will help to attract more talented international students to serve for US. It is a part of American Dream as well, which is the essence of US and has made it strong and proud. Some people claim the OPT student are taking jobs from American people, which is not completely true. OPT students significantly stimulate the activity of the field and push it develop faster, which eventually bring more opportunities to the country. Imagine if all these talented people go to other countries and become our competitors, how many jobs we might lose at the end?
