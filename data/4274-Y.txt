I strongly support the OPT extension for F-1 non-immigrant students with STEM degree. 

1. First of all, the job market is not full and closed to talent American students, however, it is eager to hire more labor with STEM degree. As a teaching assistant in a state owned university, I saw more and more American students studying in computer science or EE, who can easily find a job after graduation, even in some giant companies, like Google or Facebook. Another fact is, international student only occupied a small proportion of the job market.

2. International students are not taking away job opportunities from Americans. Actually, by their hard working and intelligence, they are helping their employers to defend competitor overseas and contributing to the booming of American's economy. This, in return, would attract more and more talent students to work in the States and create more and more job positions. I think this is also the key factor that United Stated is the leading country in many technical and scientific domains.

3. Last but not at least. International students are not spending their salary in their original country. They work here, and buy things here, which would be also benefits to the community. The problem is not that we have to many international students. In fact, we need more industries moving back to the States.
