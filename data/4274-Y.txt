Xueying Zhang I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them practice what they learnt and keep making CONTRIBUTIONS to the U.S. 

2. DIVERSITY is very important for the U.S. Many famous people who make contributions to the U.S. were original international students. Diversity is the key characteristic that the U.S. can attract talent people who will give the U.S. a better future. The U.S. becomes the most developed country in the world although it does not have a long history. The main reason is the diversity, which attracts the most talent people all over the world to come here and make contributions to it.

3. I agree that international students bring more COMPETITION, however, it is NOT a bad thing. The reason that international students can get their job is that they can do the job very well and the companies cannot find enough suitable native students to do so. Competition helps the U.S. to find more talent people and make the students to improve themselves and become more competitive. This will increase the competitiveness of the whole group. It means a lot for the U.S. to maintain its competitiveness all over the world.
