There are plenty of US workers for these jobs. Companies always complain that they can't hire enough workers because they don't want to pay the wages needed to retain good workers Instead they want to hire lower paid foreign workers that will put in 16 hour days and never complain because they are desperate to stay in our country. Most of the jobs that have been created in the last seven years have been low paying and part-time. Research has shown that companies intentionally avoid hiring American workers so they can claim a need for more foreign workers. This is a form of corporate welfare and is unfair to the hardworking American workers. It is also unfair to even take into account the comments of foreign workers. Since when do foreigners get to help decide on US policies? Don't misunderstand that comment. I am not against foreigners, in fact I think they are often a tremendous benefit to our country. Our first priority though, should always be those who are citizens.
