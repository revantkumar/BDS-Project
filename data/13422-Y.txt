Ever since I received my Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering in 1961, I have observed Engineering firms going out of their way to hire foreign engineers, making it difficult for American engineering graduates to find well paying positions.

On a related subject, I think that visas for foreign students should be eliminated in order to force our colleges to drastically cut their outrageously high tuition costs.
