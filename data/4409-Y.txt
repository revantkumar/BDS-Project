I support this regulation! 

As a county upholds the freedom and diversity, America has allowed millions of illegal immigrants to enter this country and has thousands of green card lottery winners every year to stay here. Why don't we allow more well-educated and competent people step their foot on this Promise Land and open a door to for them to create a better work and live place for the entire Americans? We not only need the blue collar, but also white collar and golden collar for this country! Diversity! 

Or we want to send those people who have obtained higher education degrees from the U.S. to go back to their own countries to contribute to their countries which will become stronger one day? 

Americans are smart, and they could do the math.
