I'm an international student who is eligible for the STEM OPT extension policy. I strongly support this policy not only because I can benefit from it, but also because I believe it's the right thing to do for the United States. This policy will greatly consolidate the competitive power of the United States in the hi-tech field, which can therefore benefit enormous American hi-tech companies and their employees. Needless to say, highly trained and skilled tech workers are indispensable part of this booming industry, which has already been and will continue to be the economic engine of this country.

Of course, as we all know, in a diverse society, there's no public policy that can benefit everyone. It requires insight and bravery for the policy makers and all the members of our society to embrace this difficult choice, which is good to the society and the nation in the long term, but will make some people's life harder in the short term. However, this hardness is not caused by unfairness, but merely from fair competition, which is actually, in my opinion, the sole of free market and free economy, the faith of American people, and the reason many of those who gave up everything they had in their native country came here for. Members of WashTech, stop wining about new comers taking away the jobs, expand your knowledge, sharpen your skills and man up! Join with all the new comers to make our mutual prosperity and make this country the greatest forever.
