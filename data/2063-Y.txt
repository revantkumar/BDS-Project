I strongly support this proposal for new 24 months extension of STEM OPT. Obviously, this is a win-win strategy for both US and international students. On one hand, for US, the international students can help US tech companies to create more value and bing more revenue. Meanwhile, this will bring more tax for IRS, which would benefit every US citizens. On the other hand, OPT extension is a good opportunity to gain more experience in real-world industry.

Having reviewing many negative comments, I found that there is a common thing in this comments. That is, they are worried about that US citizens would lose their job in all kind of industries. Actually, I do not think they need to worry about this. At first, the OPT-extension will only benefits international students with STEM degree, and only allow them work in tech industry. Therefore, the US citizens do not need to worry about international students would compete with them for the job opportunities in all field.

On the other hand, the US tech companies definitely prefer US citizens over international students if they have the same skill and capability. Since, they can work here without any restrictions, but the international students need sponsor from the companies. However, the tech companies have a large number of positions to be filled. That is why OPT extension is needed for STEM degree. And the completion in these fields will benefit all the industries to find excellent employers to improve the technology development in US.

In summary, the correct thing those worrying about is not the OPT extension will lead them losing job opportunities, but that they need to improving their skills and competitiveness. After all, if you are not skillful enough, you will never hired regardless of your citizenship. We cannot deny that competitions are everywhere in the world. But the competitions will benefit the technology, society, and the country.
