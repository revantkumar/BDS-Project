Luyu Jin This is a great new rule. Improving and Expanding Training opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees are very beneficial to U.S. economy and the development of U.S. technology. As you seen, not all of them will have chance to have this training opportunities, only students with STEM degrees will have, and the positions that they have are vacant positions, which U.S. employers have trouble to find U.S. citizens to fill in. In addition, most F-1 students return to their home after opt training, and they have made a great contribution to this great country. We love this beautiful country and we would like to build this great country stronger, so we need have those F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees help U.S.'s growth.
