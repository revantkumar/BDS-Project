Lingdong He I support this proposal to extent the OPT for STEM majors. The key reason is to allow graduates from foreign countries to contribute to this country. They spend several years in the US and are familiar with the local conditions. They are the most needed talents in STEM fields. American don't like to learn science, technology, engineering and math. But the development of the country need the talents in these fields. To keep the leading position in the STEM ensures the long-term development of the country in STEM field. More importantly, many fields relate to the critical fields such as health, environment, and infrastructure, etc. These fields are the foundation of the stability of the society. We need more people to work on. The extension of OPT can bridge the cap gap of h1b and enables more people to work for the country.
