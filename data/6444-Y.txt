I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons;
1. The government should give more opportunities for students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities to keep making contributions to the U.S.
2. More competition is not a bad thing. So the U.S. can be more competitive in the world.
3. Diversity is also important. There are so many famous people in the U.S. are international students before. They made huge contribution to the U.S. economy, science, and more.
