I'm strongly support the OPT extension policy for the following reasons:
1. This policy will not harm the benefits for american graduates students. In CMU, the number of applications from american students for professional master program are far less than the capacity of the program which indicates that international students are not taking american students' opportunities. In the other hand, the tuition for those professional programs becomes a main income for the department and are been used for improving the education quality for undergraduate students as well.
2. This policy will help American high tech companies grow fast and keep competitive in the world. Recently, more and more IT companies in China has shown amazing growing speed. In the epic of information technology, IT companies highly determine the competitiveness for a county. And the quality and quantity of trained engineers are the key factors for an IT company. Though many american students shows talent on STEM area, the number is still far less than the demand for those on-growing companies. 
In conclusion, the policy does no harm but only good for American people.
