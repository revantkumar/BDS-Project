This activity was first proposed by then Senator Kerry, Now Secretary of State. His reasoning was that U.S. citizen graduates in the fields of sciences and technology were far less capable and had a worse work ethic than foreign graduates in the same fields. However he failed to point out that most new technology and advances in every category of work studies have indicated that U.S. workers in all fields have always produced at a higher level of production output and at a higher level of quality output than any other country on earth. In addition have developed more patentable technologies, increases in efficiencies and sound state of the art practices than anywhere on earth. 
From industrial reviews of world wide patents it is apparent that foreign students in U.S. upper level of education have an aim of filing foreign patent application of U.S. developments within very short times of returning home to their place of origin.
Am extension of the stays by foreign students would only give foreign students more time to sudy and collect industrial developments and conduct espionage on research, including military information and equipment, manufacturing, materials sciences, pharmacutical medicines, etc., all which would have drastic effects on U.S. positions in security and economy, let alone, U.S. employmment and other areas.
An extension of stay in the U.S. would not benefit the U.S. but would be a detriment to the U.S. existence.
