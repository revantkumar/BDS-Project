Stop giving foreign workers preference over US citizens, especially American college graduates who studied to get technology jobs that are wrongfully taken from Americans in order to specifically benefit foreign workers. STop It. You are making a total mockery of America and Americans. What country in the world gives Americans the benefits and privileges and wealth that the US nondiscriminately hands out to foreign workers. I have two siblings that are computer experts for 40 years in the US. In every industry and company they have worked they were forced to sit by and watch as thousands of technology jobs were literally handed to mostly unqualified foreign workers. These workers were given texts to study on the job so they could even do their jobs. These workers couldn't speak English, and were tutored so they could do their jobs, jobs which should have gone to Americans, especially American youth who have trained for these jobs and been wrongfully denied these jobs. My siblings would have lost their jobs decades ago if they had been replaceable. Since my siblings are well educated and well skilled, the companies cannot fire them. Foreign workers are not educated and skilled. That's the truth. It doesn't matter though, because the US only supports foreign workers. American citizens are treated like third class property. You should be ashamed for failing to give American students the opportunity to get solid jobs in the industry they've trained to work in. Shame on you!!!
