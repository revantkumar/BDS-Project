I strongly agree with the OPT extension. Since the development of American is faster and faster, We need more talent people to crest more property for our country. Although the direct corresponding person are all foreign students, they are young and energetic with passion and dream. Allowing such person to stay in our country could increase the economy of the entire county. What's more, most of STEM students are with high education and always friendly to the people around them. Such as my classmate in the college, he always help the primary school students to study math. Although the culture is different to the foreigners, they try to adapted to the American culture and even making our own culture better. Don't let these talent students go if they want to stay here, we American are humble and strong. I believe, we will make our county better together!
