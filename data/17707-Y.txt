I am an international student who graduated (magna cum laude) with an A.B. in physics from Princeton University. Now I am pursuing a PhD in the same field at another American institution.

I support increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months. I believe this increased period of practical training is important for students to fully develop their skills and find employment opportunities.
