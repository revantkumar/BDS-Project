And now Donald Trump says that he is going to do it too, making H-1B's unlimited for foreigners graduating from colleges and universities in our country. Any immigrant could go to a US college or university using our scholarships and tax payer financed tuituon loans on in-state tuition, then would be able eligible for a work visa to stay when then they graduated - allowing them to bypass H-1B lottery limits, so that corporations can hire them, replacing Americans faster than ever at a big discount to kill pensions, bonuses, savings plan matching, tenures, and promotions with raises. I was Donald Trump's biggest fan but he is turning out to be in tge corporate pockets.
