It is a testament to the power of money in politics that policies like this ever see the light of day. As if the abuse of the H-1B visa program by tech companies weren't bad enough, these large concerns like Microsoft, Verizon, ABC/Disney. and other large, often multi-national, companies seek to replace Americans in the tech workforce with lower-priced foreign individuals who will pay less into income tax and the general economy than the Americans they displace. Frankly, the only ones who benefit from this narrow-minded self-centered approach are members of the government whose re-election or re-appointment to office are financed by the lobbying of these corrupt large corporations.
If this kind of policy were brought forth on evidence that American Science and Education were actually helped by this then I would happily agree with it - but there is no such evidence, only anecdotal nonsense designed to deceive. And the deception surrounding these kinds of requests has fooled some prominent scientists like Michio Kaku who see the academic benefits of allowing more PhD candidates in while completerly ignoring the fact that for every PhD candidate, we let in 100 trade-school graduates barely able to speak the language who displace Americans in the workforce.
This has to stop as it is leading to the ruin of the American economy and middle class prosperity.
