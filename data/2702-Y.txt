The ability to attract and retain talented people from all over the world has been one of the most important reasons that US is the most powerful country in the world. Foreign talents with STEM major help innovate in so many ways, and innovation is the key driving force of economic growth. The opinion that foreign workers are "stealing" the jobs from US citizen are wrong and short-sighted.
