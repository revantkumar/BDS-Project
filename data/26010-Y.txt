From what I understand, you won't benefit from this policy if you are not able to find a job in the US after graduation. That says, we are talking about college/grad school gradates with a good employment in technology sector. They are good in what they do. There is still a huge job supply in the technology sector. Keeping those graduates will not take the job opportunities away from our citizens. In fact, it helps our employers getting more talents for those high-demand jobs. There is not harm of it to our overall economy. Besides that, when was the last time you heard some international students on OPT STEM is in a crime? From my personal work experience, most of them are very quiet and very good at their jobs. Our economy can definitely benefit from it.
