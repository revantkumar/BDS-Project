Opportunities are for better prepared people. If Americans are capable and smart enough, they don't need to worry about their jobs being taken at all. Only though who are not good enough will be afraid of the immigrants. Then I say, it is not reasonable to exclude the good people who will also improve American economy just because you are afraid it will hurt some trash's working opportunities. Competition results in progress. If this policy can encourage those lazy people to work out and study instead of eating welfare and enjoy easy employment, I will strongly support this policy!
