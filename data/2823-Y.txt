I am supportive of the new rule regarding the 24-month OPT extension for STEM students, but I am also urging them to extend this further for 24 + 24 months extension. 

Although this rule will substantially reduces the losses of contributing foreign employees for US companies and also ensures that employers to continuously provide high technology and healthcare to American citizens. 

In addition, this rule will encourage future foreign students in the STEM field to perform scientific research in the US universities. which is not only financially beneficial to US universities, but also to adds cultural diversity and intellectual properties to the US universities.
