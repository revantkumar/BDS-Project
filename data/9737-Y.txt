Yan Chen Please support STEM OPT for foreign students. I understand the concern that foreign students take the jobs from Americans. But think about it in another way, the well educated and talented STEM students will benefit USA. By accepting more self supported and hard working people, they will buy houses, new cars and all kinds of services and products. Allowing them to live and work in US is CREATING JOBS and they are PAYING TAX! 
Although I am not a US citizen and may be not neutral for making comments, I want to say please let the market to decide if a person is a good fit to a specific job, not by emotion. By doing that, the whole country and society will create most values and benefit everyone!
Thanks!
