Our nation's high-tech industry is in need of highly skilled workers specialized in science, engineering, mathematics. Foreign students studying these majors in US are the main source of such workers. The current immigration policy makes it difficult for these students to stay in US and apply their skill in our industry. This is against the short and long term interest of our nation, especially after we have invest much in our universities to educate and train these students.

For our economy to continuously grow, we need a reform in our policy. This proposal is in the right direction and I fully support it.
