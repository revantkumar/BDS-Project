Even though this is too much like being right; However, here's a thought...Just imagine the tables being turned if we were at their country and we were the immigrants trying to take over their jobs and land. What would you think their reactions will be? Part of the solution,.. stop "sleeping in bed" or "making deals" what we call it; with these countries and we can't even take care of our own. Oh, that's right we are the land of the free right? yeah okay...
