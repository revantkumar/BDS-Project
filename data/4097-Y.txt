I do support this extension. Firstly, international students with STEM usually do great contribution to the scientific and technical corporation which is the important contribution to GPD of US. Secondly, usually scientific companies need to spend few months to train a new employee, if international students don't have longer OPT, the companies need to spend extra time to hire an new person and train him for a long time. It will waste a lot of time and money for the company. Thirdly, international students with STEM will do the jobs that local students will not like to do. You can find in the colleges, in the computer science and electrical engineering classes, there are very few local students. That means the extension of OPT for international students will not influence the employment of local students.
