I am a electrical engineer and I know it's so important for engineering students to have work experience in US and apply what they learn from school to the industry. The OPT program makes US is a unique place for all the students in the world who want to study abroad. Compared to other countries like UK & Australia, the OPT & OPT extension are very good opportunities for talented foreign students to make contributions to US industries, particularly the high tech industries. And thus we can attract immigrants from all over the world and keep US on top of the competence. It would be an unwise decision to vacate this rule.
