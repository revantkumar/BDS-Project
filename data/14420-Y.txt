I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Most international students learn advanced technologies from the university and their knowledge is very beneficial to the U.S society. The country should give them the chance to make contributions to the U.S.

2. The U.S society is united with people in different colors, religions, and races, and it has the most freedom in the world. Under this situation, international people and native people will work harmony and new ideas will spring out after diverse discussions.
