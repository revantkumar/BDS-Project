Ankit Arun To whomsoever it may concern:

I strongly support extension of STEM OPT for F-1 non immigrant students. It gives us an opportunity to work in a competitive and progressive market. It is also beneficial for the US economy as we students help to develop and flourishes the companies here US.
We generate a huge amount of taxes, that is beneficial for the US citizens as well.

I believe the OPT period should be extended to help us get a chance to get H1-B visa.
