I believe this extension is a step forward but the proposed extension is not enough. 
I am a student majoring in Mechanical Engineering. As stated in the proposal, projects in STEM areas last far longer than current available 19 months. For example, NSF gives 3 years to most research programs. But this is only the basic. A lot of times, you do not know what will happen during your progress and quite possibly you need to extend the research program a little longer, like half year or one year. In these cases, this new proposed 24 months extension is not enough.
I believe the extension should be longer, like 36 months, to be more flexible and practical. Then ongoing research programs will not be cut off closing to the end, which will be great loss to research programs and research institutions.
