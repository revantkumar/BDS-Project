I strongly support the new opt extension regulation. High-end international STEM workers usually not just try to find themselves jobs, they also create many more job opportunities. At least one of the founders of many famous tech-companies (e.g., Yahoo, Google, Tesla Motors, Marvell, Facebook, Linkedin, etc.) nowadays are born abroad or have international backgrounds. 

Given enough OPT extension time, both companies and foreign STEM workers do not have to worry about their working time limit, which creates a relatively fair, just, active and competitive job markets for all the job seekers. Companies do not have to concern too much about the cost in hiring talented international STEM students.
