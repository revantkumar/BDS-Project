I'm all for creating, not taking jobs away. Leze Fare is my answer. Stop your smoke and mirrors tactics and repeal H-1b programs completely. Let Americans, Citizens, or Naturalized Citizens, (those who have gone through the Legal Naturalization proccesses) do the jobs. Talk about outsourcing and undercutting going wages at that. Nobody should have to work for a business or Government, willingly for less than prevailing wages. The only exception should be Elected Officials. :)
