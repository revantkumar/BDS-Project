I think extending OPT for foreign students with STEM degrees are necessary not just for those foreigners but also for native Americans. It would definitely increase the competition of employment, which is good to the whole economy of the US. The people who get hired are elites and they would make contribution to the development of the US. Also, the native students they understand they have to study and work hard so that they can find the satisfactory jobs.
