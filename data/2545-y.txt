Betty L. Barnes We do Not need to expand this program.
American citizens should always be hired first.....the pharmacist I have seen educated in other countries cannot surpass any U.S. trained, educated pharmacist & we have unemployed U.S. native born and educated pharmacist
who should be hired before ANY work visa/foreign trained, cheap labor, undereducated pharmacist.
