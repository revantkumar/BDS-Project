I strongly support the 24 month STEM opt extension for following reasons.

Firstly, the OPT is an significant advantages for US universities being over universities of other countries. Why would foreign people choose to study in US? What is the advantages of universities of US over universities of other countries? I ask several friends for answers of that. What they told me is that US have better chances for intern and full time jobs, which makes them more competitive in the job market when they go back to their countries after the OPT. If OPT is cancelled, US universities would lose their most significant advantages immediately, since other countries like The Britain or Australia can also provide excellent education with much lower tuition fee. To sustain the competition of universities and to attract more outstanding and wealthy foreign students to choose US for their higher education, I highly suggest that the OPT extension policy should be sustain and extended. 

In the same time, US is the most powerful country in the world. To sustain its hegemony position, the countries need to know more about its competitors. And to know more and win from other countries, foreign students are the best source for US to know better about the world. For example, it is critical for US company who plan to develop globally to hire foreign students ,who knows culture of US and also their home countries, and they can provide better advices for the US company to develop their business in foreign countries correctly. Those foreign students are treasures for those global US companies. And one year OPT is obviously not enough for those companies to train and explore foreign market. Longer OPT means more reliable employees, which is beneficial to both employer and employees. The formal can better use the value of their employees, and the latter would acquire more competition when they go back to their home countries for longer developments.
