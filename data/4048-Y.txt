I strongly support the new STEM OPT Extension policy! First of all, this policy can greatly strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. academic field globally. International students should not be blamed for affecting the job market. Rather, they help and keep the United States to stay on top of the science and technology fields, and devote themselves to those positions that qualified local people could not be found. Secondly, the new STEM OPT Extension policy will also greatly BOOST U.S. ECONOMY through having talented foreign people to further contribute their intelligence to this country! This has benefited the U.S. society over the past few decades, and should be remained to support the growth of U.S. economy now and in the future.
