From my perspective, professionals from STEM makes an extraordinary contribution to the economy of United States in three ways. Firstly, advanced industries are in highly demand of a large amount of qualified STEM professionals to achieve a dominant position among other countries, which is important for U.S. to continuously take the lead of the world's overall order. However, U.S. citizens cannot satisfy the need of the industries. If international students from STEM can have an extension of OPT period, it certainly relieve the work force shortage pressure on many companies. Secondly, with the extension of OPT time period, it will promote the competition among U.S. citizens and international students, which will largely enhance the skills and the efforts from both sides. It certainly will help U.S. to keep competitive in highly qualified job candidates throughout the country. Thirdly, STEM extension will improve the relationship and the cultural communication between U.S. and other countries. In other word, diversified employees will bring out more understanding of different cultures and respect each other, which is significantly important in the globalizaion. In conclusion, the extension of OPT brings out a great amount of benefits to U.S. citizens, companies and government.
