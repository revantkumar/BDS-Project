I definitely support this proposal. 
Im a 5th year Ph.D. student in STEM. This proposal is very helpful for people like myself to gain more practical experience by working in the companies. Such experience is extremely helpful for our career, and will make American education more attractive in the world. At the end, I will have the opportunity to contribute our knowledge(from university) and practical experience(from companies) to the society. The negative part is that some companies have the opportunities to abuse this policy and then affect Americans job opportunities. This can be prevented by a formal E-Verify oversight process, which is also indicated in this proposal.
