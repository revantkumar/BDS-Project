Zhuqing Cheng First of all, there are not many STEM international students. Given such small amount of students, how can they fill the big tech job market?
Second, not only tech companies need STEM workers, lots of traditional industries are transitioning to the Internet economic mode now. Actually all the human society are transitioning. With such a big demand, there are should be more STEM students working together, not less.
Third, it is a lost for the US to see STEM students go. Companies need talented workers. The government gets more taxes. There are more customers to consume more goods. The market will thrive with more consumption. 
Forth, remember the history. During the world war II, lots of European scientists fled to the US. They contributed to the current US thriving. Another Einstein might be among the students. 
Fifth, it is actually really hard to get a green card. So foreign STEM students will work here, pay taxes, and buy goods, and leave eventually because they don't have green cards. What hard can do to the country?

Above all, it is the Constitution that gives the students the rights to stand on this land. Hard working people deserve to live here.
