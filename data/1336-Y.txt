I completely support this proposal! 

I always hear stories about some companies refused to hire new F1 graduates because they think they will spend a lot of money for applying H1B for them in a very short time. If the proposal passed, those company would be more willing to hire graduates because the graduates can work for them for a longer period without worrying about H1B application.
