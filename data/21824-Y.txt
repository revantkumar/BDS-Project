I am an international student who just started my OPT in May of this year. My major is computer engineering. I strongly agree with the new rule. STEM extention cannot be cancelled and it is better to be 24 months. There are two reasons for deciding to study in New York. First, I love this city because of its culture and technology. If I have longer OPT, I can study more and do more things for my company. Now the company are setting up business online just like Amazon. This program will continue long time. If the extention cancelled, the company may lose money, time and good faith degree. I know all of the information and system. If I will leave, it is bad for the company. They need to train new people. Actually, the residents didnot study software more. US need more people to code and support security for all industries such as Google , Amazon, USPS and so on. It is important.
However, the second reason I come is the OPT rules. I could work for 29 months. It is longer than other country. If the extention cancelled, I feel sad. Before I came to US, I had multiple options to purse my master degree in US, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong and British. The most important reason I choose to study here is US could provide me the industry training opportunity during school or after graduation. So OPT extension is very important to attract foreign STEM talents. Without this OPT extension rule, I can't believe US could still attract so many foreign STEM talents every year to contribute their knowledge to this country and I probably would choose to study in other countries with better policy to foreign STEM talents. I spend much money to study here. Most international student pay more. If we choose other countries to study, the universities will lose lot of money to construct and dig into technology. So I think OPT extention can not be cancelled.
