Jiaqi Luo I am a big fan of the OPT extension.

When I were still a student I got offers from a lot of countries like: Imperial College London in UK, Australian National University in Australia and so on. But finally I choose Carnegie Mellon University in US. Why ? Mostly it is because U.S. government provide a good opportunity for international engineer student to work after graduation.I treasured this 1-year OPT + 17month Extension. I think this experience will be very helpful for me after I go back to China. I believe U.S government is trustworthy government. You will not revoke his commitment to people from all over the world. 

There is another big disaster for the United States if OPT extension is revoked. Take myself as an example, I am working on a big project about data analysis and algorithm development for about half a year, which will take at least 1 more year to implement . If extension is revoked, I have to leave U.S. and stop my part of that project. It's hard for company to find other people to take over my part. They need to employ another engineer to restart what I have done. Because sometime in IT industry, redevelopment is easier to take over other's work. However, it is still a loss of my company. Maybe I am just a small part of my company. But if OPT extension stops, there are at least 10-20 engineers leaving our company at the same time. It will became a big damage for our company's daily operation and development. I believe, our company is just a small example. There are ten thousands of international students working in all kinds of companies. It will became a disaster for U.S companies even for U.S industry. At last, it will become a huge damage to U.S citizens. 

At last, I want to say again it is highly recommended to OPT extension, not only for international students but also for U.S and U.S citizens.
