I believe opt extension is not only good to students but also good to America in many ways. 
First, STEM students provide a lot of excellent labor for different areas. 
Second, many important researches are worked out during opt extension because an outstanding research needs a lot of time, money and energy. 
Third, it is also a good opportunity for students to apply what they have learned in class to reality.
