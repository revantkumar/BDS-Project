I came to US five years ago and finished my undergraduate and graduate education in this country. I paid full tuition for five years and now I finally found a job and started learning as well as contributing in the real industry. I am treated like a IS resident for tax purpose although legally I am alien. I spent the most valuable growth period in this country. I was diligent in my study, involved in extracurricular activities, and even participated in a lot of volunteer events. I want to continue my exploring trip here in US and improving myself as well as helping others in the near future. If this country is still open to talents, I believe this proposed rule will get support not only from international students but from US citizens who care about the development of their country.
