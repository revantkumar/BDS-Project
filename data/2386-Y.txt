As we all know, It's hard to finish a STEM degree( especially Ph.d). Most American citizens don't want touch these areas, because they know how hard and struggled it is. Now since those international students want to devote themselves to make a contribution to this great country in this hard area for which most americans don't want to touch. Why not give them an opportunity to make this country to be a better and powerful country. We all know American can be a super country depending on those talanted people comes from these STEM area. Without the assistance of these areas' talents, how can American walk on the moon? How can Google, Facebook, Microsoft become a super company in this world? 

American is a diversity country which is makes this country more powerful, beautiful and attractive. But if you refused those talented people from all over the world, it will be a disaster to this country. 

Thus, I believe extension will makes this country become more attractive and powerful in the future. And this won't be a threat to american people, cause most american people won't want to step into these arduous area.
