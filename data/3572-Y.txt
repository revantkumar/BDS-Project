I strongly agree with this rule. I have seen some comments saying that there are 9 million people unemployed in U.S.A. But guys those are not graduates with STEM degree. By approving this rule we are not giving jobs of those guys to international students but we are actually creating jobs for them.

There are no citizen with STEM degree are unemployed. there are millions of open positions for STEM degree graduates but we do not have enough people for those jobs. So the growth of our economy is stopped. If this rule is approved then our country will grow a lot and we will be able to create more and more employment for those 9 million unemployed people.

I request everyone to think before commenting and support this rule.
