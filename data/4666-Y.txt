I strongly support the new extension rule of STEM. Both industry and academy of the US require a large amount of people majored in STEM. And the problem is many US students are not choosing STEM as their majors, which is leading to a gap in the job market. This gap was filled by international students in the past many years, and this situation will definitely continue. Without the STEM extension the US will have a risk of losing these international students and future employees, which will be harmful to the overall development of the US. 
Take myself as an example. I worked in a high-tech company since I got my phD from MIT with my OPT. At that time I did not get my H1B on time, and the STEM extension helped me survive that period. Without the extension I might not continue to work in the US and contribute to the technology development of this nation. As a result, having STEM extension will help the US keep smart people all around the world to stay and contribute their wisdom to this nation.
