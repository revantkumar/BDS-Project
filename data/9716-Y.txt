Jing Li I strongly support this rule as it provides America more superior STEM students. Most of people who objects to this rule due to the fear of competition. But this is not the case. As far as I know, the government has done sufficient work to protect US citizens. If an US citizen and an international student who has the same background applies for a same job, international student has obvious disadvantages such as language problem, status, etc. 

I do not believe companies recruits foreign labors just because they are cheap (I have no idea if they do cheap but some comments say this). They must also be skilled and diligent. If you're afraid of the wage suppression, I suggest controlling the minimum wage of F-1 students. Without lower wage advantage, the only thing you need to worry about is your ability. This must be better than rejecting skilled international students to work in America. They also pay taxes and they are excellent. 

America wanna attract more talented person all over the world. I believe this is why you have OPT program. In this case, this proposal is really needed. Currently, the OPT time is not sufficient for those excellent international students to get their H1B VISA. Some of them have to leave due to the bad luck. This leads to unnecessary personnel changes and brings companies losses. 

In sum, unless you are going to close this program, the OPT extension is an inevitable change to make this program better work for America.
