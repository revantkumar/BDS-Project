Vincent Johnson As a US citizen and an employee in a technology company, I strongly support this proposal. Here's why:

1. There are many smart, hardworking F-1 students in our company. They are essential to us from a perspective of productivity .

2. We were all immigrants. We fought our way to achieve the American dream, just as these students are doing now. Those who sit at home and complain others take their jobs is because they are not capable of doing what these students are doing. We wouldn't hire them any way. Besides, the number of American STEM students is far from enough to meet the demand.
