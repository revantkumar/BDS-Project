Hanxiao Qi The STEM OPT extension is necessary! Some one argues that there are more students holding STEM degrees than STEM jobs, so there is no shortage of STEM workers. But the point is that not every STEM degree holder is capable of a STEM job! If you are hiring, you wouldn't want that you only have one candidate. Because a STEM degree holder could have all kinds of issues preventing him/her to became a good employee. If the number of the STEM degree holder is less than or equal to the number of STEM jobs, everyone could get a job after graduation, then there will be no competing, therefore people don't have to learn and work hard and productive forces will decrease. The big companies don't have to worry because the better candidates would prefer to work for them. But most companies are not so attractive. If you don't like a employee in your group, you couldn't just fire him or her because you don't have so many choices. The next one could be worse because those are all that left!

The most important reason is that, even with the 24 months OPT extension, the foreign STEM degree holders are still much less competitive than the native ones. To hire a foreign candidate, the company need to pay a lot of money to sponsor him or her, and the language could be another big problem, so they only hire foreigners when they don't have natives to choose at all! That's to say that most of the competition is between the foreigners themselves! For those residents who against this rule: you already got the protection! This is not your business!
