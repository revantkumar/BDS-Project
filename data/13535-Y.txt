I'm a recent graduate from University of Michigan CoE, now working as an software engineer intern. OPT extension is very useful for us international students to get real experience. I heard so many of my talented friends who were not luck enough to get the "lottery working visa" and their companies have to let them go, although they are highly depends on their work. But with the OPT extension, students can work for a longer time, companies can offer more times of "visa lottery", suddenly a "double lose" becomes a "double win". If one ever went to an university, he/she will notice international students works harder and their grades are better in the most cases. Companies know that to. OPT extension helps the companies to use good international students, and help international students to get the REAL experience to benefit themselves.

God help us to make the 24-month extension real, for the sake of both employer and internationals.
