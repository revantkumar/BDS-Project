I support this rule for the following reasons.
1. This is a chance for foreign students to pursue their American dreams.
2. People who are good at their jobs will contribute to the US society no matter they are US citizens or foreigners.
3. This new rule will attract more good students to come to the US, and therefore promote the technology development.
