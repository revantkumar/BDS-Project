I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The governmentshould let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universitiesstay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. 

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S. and mangy can attribute to the internatinal schoolars. As we can see, it is no doubt that international schoolars has realized trementous of achievements which benifit the citizens living in the U.S.

3.Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. On the one hand, some of the jobs are unsuitabel for citizens while international graduates are capable for such jobs. Besides, many international graduates earn a low wages with amounts of workloads.

American people are wise enough not to harm our long-term benefits by irrational fear and temporary, illusive satisfactions. International students are helping America grow, and are improving the welfare of American people. Losing them will benefit our competitors and harm US interest. I strongly believe we should pass this proposal and pass more bills in the congress that could make it easier for the international students to stay.
