It is absolutely moronic to support improving and expanding training opportunities for non-immigrant students. four to six million students that graduated this year can not find jobs in the field of their choice. Why create more students that can't find jobs? Money would better spent creating jobs for those already here, not educating more job-less people. Taking money from Social Security and Medicare to pay for these people is not smart, because they are not required to pay either one; and it angers me, because I am on /social Security.
