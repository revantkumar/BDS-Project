The OPT should be extended because:

1 Foreigners are not taking jobs from Americans. 
Companies are looking for qualified employees to perform. Foreigners get hired means there's not enough local labor for the job. Sending qualified foreigners away doesn't mean unqualified Americans can get the job, but only means a hole in the labor pool that companies suffer from. Canceling OPT extension doesn't help the employment situation.

2 Education system benefit from longer OPT.
American education industry becomes so profitable and renowned, because of students coming from the entire world. Education is about learning to do things. If there's not enough opportunity to practice, learning becomes armchair strategy. Learning without doing won't attract as much international students. Thus, American education system benefit from longer OPT, and vise versa.

3 Canceling OPT goes against the value of freedom.
Foreigners who get the chance to extend their OPT have proved their value to companies. They work so hard with both hands, but their contribution to the United States is not appreciated if OPT extension is canceled. In that case, they did nothing wrong, but America is no longer the land of freedom and opportunity to them. 

4 "America was not built on fear."
If we cancel OPT extension because we are afraid that there's not enough jobs, we become cowards. Society is always balanced, just like nature. People produce and consume, take jobs and create jobs. OPT is not the cause of problems. We should have the courage to find the things we should improve in our social system, so that the land of America becomes a better homeland. 

As Harry S Truman once said, "America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand." 

Don't be unfair on people who have the talent, the courage, and the will to do the job at hand, and build the country together.
