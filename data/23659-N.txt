As the wife of an IT professional with less and less income in the available in the field these days, I oppose this extension. As a mother of two up and coming college aged girls. I am most concerned about the debt they will take on with the very real possibility their chosen fields will be more inclined to hire tax credits, receive Federal and or State grants, not my daughters.

I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Three years is a very long time for young Americans needing training and a salary of heir own.
