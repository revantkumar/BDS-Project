After those weeks of stress where we did not know what our future in the United States would be, this rule is a welcome change. Everyone deserves a chance to mold their career and future. It is great to see the United States taking this step in helping 1000s of young minds try to find their place. Passing this rule not only allow us to continue pursuing our dreams but also save companies from being affected by the sudden loss of their employees.

All my support for this rule. Please approve it.
