Bryan Bu The most important reason that U.S. can keep its leadership in the world during the last century is that it has been a heaven for smart, innovative, and hard working immigrants. The long history of human beings should have enough evidence to tell us again and again that attracting smart talents is quite important for a country's long term prosperity!

I strongly support STEM OPT extension with the following reasons:
-- If a foreign student can earn a STEM degree or advanced STEM degree here, it means they have the skill set and capability to contribute to our economy. 

-- If we force STEM graduates to leave the country right after graduation, we will see more and more high tech companies like Huawei, Baidu, Tencent, InfoSys, Alibaba, etc, in other countries to compete with us!! 

-- An important portion of STEM graduates are PhDs and masters, who usually receive scholarships/fellowships from the U.S. government, e.g., NSF, NIH, DAPPA etc. Does it make sense to spend fundings and resources to train those highly specialized scientists/engineers and then just let them go away to contribute to our competitors? 

-- I work in a high tech company in the San Francisco Bay area. What I can tell is it is VERY HARD to hire a great engineer in our specialized technical area. A large portion of qualified candidates we haven seen are foreign students. We have to let those talents have a legal way to work here.

-- Compared with "illegal" immigrants that comes from places that everyone knows, the number of legal STEM degree immigrants are just so small! It's just stupid to force legal, talent foreign students to leave but at the same time open the boarder to welcome cohorts of "illegal" immigrants (and even pay their insurance)!
