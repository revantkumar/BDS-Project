I strongly support this extension. I think each people should have equal opportunity to work in US or everywhere in the world, no matter where he comes from. For those who argument that international STEM students make US citizens less working opportunity. I totally disagree with this point. I think opportunity should be deserved by people who prepared well and knowledgeable, skillful, and not for people who regard themselves as the citizens or born with racial advantage. Everywhere in the world, people should be treated equally.
