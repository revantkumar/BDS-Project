I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons:

1. Knowledge gained by those STEM qualified students is cutting-edge and they are also as a crucial part of the community developing such cutting-edge knowledge.

2. Theoretical knowledge and Technical skills gained by those students from United States should be utilized by those U.S. companies in order to contribute to U.S. economy. Otherwise we are letting talents go to create a huge technology recession in our own country but give others a boost. 

3. Major labor disruption would be caused which can and will lead to a significant economy recession.
