I STRONGLY SUPPORT the 24-month OPT extension for STEM students!
The reason are as below:
1. Students using OPT extension are actively involved in high technology industry which supports US economy a lot. Cancelling OPT extension will definitely be disadvantaged for the nation.
2. Providing OPT extension is attractive to international students. A US degree with 3 years working experience is more competitive than just one degree with zero experience. So 24-month OPT extension can attact more talent students and make US education keeps blossom and stay the No.1 in the world.
3. There are many students are currently in OPT extension status. Cancelling OPT extension is really unequal and disappointing, it is cruel to force people to change their career path unwillingly!
