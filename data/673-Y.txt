Only companies with E-verify could hire international people. E-verify is a USA program that ensures the company is not hiring cheap international people over American people. Therefore, what people say about STEM would let companies hire cheap international labor that would steal American jobs is an invalid point.
For the companies with no E-verify, well, they could illegally hire any body, whether STEM rule is there or not.
