It is impossible to believe that the most technologically advanced country in the world, a nation of 320 million people, needs to import talent from abroad to maintain its global lead. We put a man on the moon without Indian and Chinese physicists and engineers. In fact, we have a surplus of scientific and technical talent in this country. There is absolutely NO shortage of science and tech workers in the US. This is my field and I cant tell you how many of my colleagues have been forced out of their jobs and professions by cheaper green-card PhDs. Moreover, these people are our countrymen, our family members, and our neighbors. Shouldnt they be considered first? 

There should not be any more mass immigration into the US as there has been during the last couple of decades. The US labor market just isn't strong enough to handle it. There are too many unemployed Americans, and job number one of our government should be to guarantee them a fair shot at all available American jobs. Once our unemployment problem is solved and prosperity is restored for ALL Americans (not just the top 1%), then we can take another look at immigration.
