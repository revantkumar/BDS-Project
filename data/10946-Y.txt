As an international student currently holding F-1 visa on OPT, I strongly support this proposal. For those international students who came to the United States for undergraduate, master, or PhD level education majoring in STEM, U.S. universities and institutes have invested a significant amount of efforts in advancing them academically to a whole new horizon. It is of no doubt that they are a powerful driving force for the technological development. Forbidding them from staying in the United States after remarkably completing the education not only wastes the efforts put forth by the staff of universities and institutes, but most importantly gives up a fairly powerful driving force, which will in turn slow down the pace of technological development in the United States. Although international students sometimes may take up spots in the job market which could have been given to the U.S. citizens, it sparks competition among them and note that competition is not a bad thing. Actually, it is competition that keeps pushing people to a much higher level, which will in turn speed up the pace of technological development. To sum it up, with the reasons stated above, I strongly support this STEM extension proposal.
