Dear Sir,
I firmly believe that - The Previously Obtained STEM Degrees rule is flawed and benefits only one section of the society and does not take into consideration the need of the American Economy for "Techno Business" executives.

I have a STEM undergrad degree from India , I have 8 years of STEM experience in the US and in India. I am currently doing my MBA from a top US university and plan to be working in a role that make full use of my STEM skills. I do not understand why post my MBA , I cannot get a 24 months OPT extension.

This disregards a key section of highly skilled jobs in the American economy of Technology Consultants and Product Managers - which are in shortage in the US.

Please allow Previously Obtained STEM undergrad Degrees in non US universities to be eligible for STEM OPT extension after a non STEM degree in the US. Atleast consider the ATEM experience also.

Regards.
