I am strongly in favor of this new OPT extension proposal for STEM students, not only because of I am among the thousands of them that have benefited from it and now making meaningful contribution to the nation, but also because this policy backs the future of United States of America as one of the most important means to keep the attracted talents in this nation.

It is hard to imagine spending millions of dollars on higher education for these international STEM students but most of them leaving within 12 months after graduation, if without this extension policy in favor of the nation. The US is deeply rooted in the diversified culture of immigrants whom themselves, or their ancestors, coming from all across the world. It is vitally important to keep the tradition thrive and therefore keep the prosperity atop that everybody enjoys.
