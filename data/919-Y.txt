I support the extension of OPT, which I think is good from the following aspects:

First, intelligent people are key resources to America - which is known to all, and the students with higher education in America are mostly smart and diligent. The extension allows such outstanding foreign students to work longer in America, which means that they would be given an opportunity to create more value for the country, and help the country make more improvements, which is not only beneficial to the country, but also beneficial to the globe. 

Second, international students' staying in America will also boost the local economy and improve the local development, which will in turn create more job opportunity for all the people living in America.

Third, foreign students will not decrease the job opportunity of American students, since students with OPT can only be employed by E-varified employers, which not only guarantees the job opportunity of native American students, but also provides a fair job searching environment for all the students.
