Cath Fan I fully support this new rule. I read some of the negative comments and do not find they make any sense to me: Many people claimed it was foreign students who stole their jobs. They forgot technology sectors are different from other sectors in the industry, they need the talented and creative people! Not some random people who doesn't know what they are doing! Look at most Asian and European countries and Canada, Australia, they all try their best to detain talented STEM stdents. America is losing the leading position in high-tech area. Keep in mind, this new rule only grant those students at most 2 years of training! Not giving them green cards or citizenship!
