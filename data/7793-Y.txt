I think OPT should be extended to 24 months. This is a smart decision. I have several supporting ideas. 

First of all, it support the business development in the united states. United states is one of the developed countries all over the world. It needs talent people in all fields. A diversity employment is good for the business growth. Diversity can help generate many different ideas.

Second, many people who against this OPT STEM extension rule say this may influence local employment and bring competition to permanent residents. However, I don't agree with them. Proper competition increase the development all industries and companies.Opt extension just give the international students an opportunity to compete with the locals. However, if an international students want to get employed for a position, he or she may put more effort than permanent residents because of their visa status.

Third, Equal opportunity employment is followed by most of the companies and prohibited by the law. I think this should also be used on visa status.

Forth, we are all people. we live in one earth.we should not divide people according to his nationality, his race, his religion and his culture. students is the future of the world. We should give them opportunity to prove themselves, or at least give them an opportunity to compete.

Above are my opinions. Thanks.
