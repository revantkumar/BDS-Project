I strongly support this proposal brought up by Department of Homeland Security. It just benefit both the society of the United States of America and international students who need experience practicing what they have learnt for all four years in college in this national. After the international students who has used the education resources of US, it is reasonable to have them devote more for this country with the knowledge and techniques they've learnt. This will not just increase of the vigor of the society but also generate creativity from the combination of talents from different culture background, which may provide the nation with more welfare in economics, employment as well as social.
