I absolutely support this new rule.

For international students from STEM major, they work for US tech companies. If those companies can hire US citizens who have the competitive skill set and ability as international employees, of course, they prefer US citizens due to those companies will take the risk to lose those international employees. Why do they still want international employees? Because the job market for STEM is not fully occupied. US tech companies needs a lot of labor to contribute to the US economy. If the OPT extension doesnt exist, a lot of international employees will go back to their countries, its a loss for US. It will slower the development of US economy. So why not give international students a chance to contribute to US?
