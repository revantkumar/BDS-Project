Stop OPT !!! Totally unfair to United States citizens who are paying for foreign students to take jobs away from United States citizens. Why not pay companies to hire U.S. workers. There's a concept for you!
This is an example of what candidate Donald Trump is talking about with the American people right now. No one is representing the American tax paying citizen. Who remain at the back of the line.
Enough! Do not pass this OPT bill .
