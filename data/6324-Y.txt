Man Cao I strongly support the STEM extension proposal for the following reasons:

1. It will give more opportunity to those talented, hard-working STEM students to gain experience in the world leading industries, benefiting not only their own personal development, but also the advancement of entire human being in the long term.

2. Newly graduated STEM students make substantial contribution to science and technology industry. A friendly policy towards highly skilled foreign nationals is one major reason why tech companies can maintain fast and steady growth over years. Shortening the OPT period would greatly hurt the technology industry.

3. The major source of US unemployment is not STEM extension. It is job reduction across multiple industries. Not allowing STEM extension will not solve the problem. In fact, it is very likely to worsen the situation because of its adverse impact on technology industry, which plays a crucial part in US economy.
