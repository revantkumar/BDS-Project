Jonathan Gonzalez I strongly SUPPORT the proposal.

Many people oppose this because they think it will lead American cannot find job. But there are so many reasons why our people cannot find jobs. The OPT Ext rule only applies to STEM students. Nowadays, STEM related jobs are greatly increasing. Our native companies are in great need of candidates with these majors. Our native STEM students are very limited due to hardworking learning process. The new rule will only bring prosperity and economy benefit to this country no matter short or run way.
