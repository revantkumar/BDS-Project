As a boss of a tech start-up in California,I fully support the opt.Because in my company most of the stuffs come from India and China and they did a really good job.The most outstanding stuff in my company gets H1B last year thanks to the opt extension.And he now become a good leader who I cannot imagine a better one.I want to tell those American students if you want to get a job in tech company like mine,you have to improve yourself instead of trying to chase them out of the country.I do want to more employ native students but they perform really bad in the interview.I have to say that I cannot trust such employers.If the opt was aborted,I may decide to move my company to foreign countries instead of employing some poor American programmers.If some Americans want to earn jobs by opposing the opt program,please stop it.It will be useless.Take your time and learn to be as hard-working as those Indians and Chinese!
