I strongly support the proposal for three reasons:

1. STEM students receive excellent education from American universities, and hence the government should provide them better opportunities to contribute back to the nation.

2. Global competition is getting fiercer, America need to adsorb more intelligence to its leading position, no country can do this merely rely on its own citizens.

3. Competition is long-term beneficial. It is a stimulus for us to achieve greater things, together with genius from all over the world.

I will appreciate your consideration, thank you.
