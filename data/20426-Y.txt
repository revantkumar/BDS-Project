I saw some of the comments are pretty passive. I'm wondering there will be so many benefits of extension for America, but they cannot see? The extension is vital to both internal and external environment. U.S. economic will be benefited directly from hard working of exotic high technicians. And most of the project need at lease 3 years to be done, 24 extention is necessary. Besides, the revocation of this policy will result in reduction of international students, and lose the drive force of development. On the other hand, the people who object to the extension tend to feel more peaceful and it's harmful for the whole society, because the lack of competition will lead to vicious circle of various of aspects. Consequently, the extention policy is crucial to the U.S.!
