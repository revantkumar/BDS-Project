Vipul Jarmale The United States has always maintained its place as the education destination in the world and continues to do so despite the high cost of education here (considering the tuition and living expenses people of different nationalities have to bear). The STEM degrees are highly valued and have great credibility which is why borrow loans, travel half way across the world and work hard to live the American Dream. The 24-month STEM OPT rule and the cap-gap relief are much welcomed measures taken in the direction of making the students lives easier. 

At the same time, the responsibilities on an employer sponsoring an international students has increased which will put the international student and his family back home under huge financial burden - a precarious situation that nobody would want to be in or others to be in and would also drive away STEM graduates and potential STEM degree seekers. 

Hence I support the newly proposed changes by the DHS and support it. Retaining it would help the students and the American economy greatly.
