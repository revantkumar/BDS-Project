Dear government officer,
I am here to express my thought on expanding the OPT time period for F-1 student at our country. Although expanding the OPT period for F-1 student might seems to reduce the available for U.S. citizen, the pros of having the extension can actually have more positive effects both to ourself and to the country. First of all, I think the difficulty for university graduate to find a job is not increasing at all even though some people claims the F-1 students have occupied their positions. Further more, based on my personal experience of working with non-U.S. citizen either at school or at work, I always feel that most of them are well qualified in their professional fields and if the states did not allow them to work for the countries, I will feel really sorry for wasting their knowledge. In a nutshell, I think the states should provided F-1 student with enough training period to see whether they can contribute to the state. If they can make real impact to their professional fields or to U.S. companies, I did not see a reason why we should deprive their right to get trained at U.S. or even work at U.S. The current CEO of google Pichai was a F-1 student once before, if he did not get the chance to work at U.S. he won't be able to make such big impact on IT field as he did today. Why should a company hired a less skilled U.S. citizen instead of a skilled f-1 student? For me and for my company, talented and skilled employees are always our No1 standard in hiring and who cares where he/she come from?
