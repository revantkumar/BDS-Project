I think the new policy is beneficial not only to the international students but also to the economy development of United States. Based on my previous internship in US, I found there was a growing number of opportunity and corporation between countries because of the globalization. Allowing international students involving into the states, US will definitely get more benefits since those students can help overcome problem of language and culture, bringing more opportunities as well.
