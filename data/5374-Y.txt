Zhuoqun You I strongly support the extension of OPT. Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tremendous growth to the USA economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about. Without policies like OPT-extension, it would just be a matter of time before USA becomes another mundane country where miracles no longer happen. Without the embraciveness of foreign workers, I can foresee someday very soon when USA economy stagnates, people lose jobs, and social problems arises. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. APPROVE the OPT-extension.

There is no shortage of US students in STEM: Quantity does not mean quality. There are also a huge number of foreign students in STEM but only a very small proportion of them can pass the strict interviews and finally get a job by US companies.

Why would we educate foreign students with the most advanced technology on earth and then send them back to their own country to let them compete and beat down our own industry? This doesn't make any sense and benefit nobody but our completions!!!!!!!!
