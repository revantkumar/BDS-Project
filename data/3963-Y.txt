I am totally agree with this new rule, since the high-skilled foreign workers/students in STEM fields have a long history of contributing to the advance of the science, technology and economy of the united states. This new rule will open a wide time window for the F-1 students that can work in US for this country's own benefits, meanwhile the new rule impose a stricter inspecting process to avoid the abuse of the OPT program. It will boost the economy of the United States
