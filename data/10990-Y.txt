More working opportunities for F1 students doesn't mean less jobs for Americans--very few employers would hire an international student instead of an American if they are equally or similarly qualified. They only hire foreigners when they are better. This means, better quality immigrants!! So please support this and stop the "no job for American" nonsense! (If you can't get a job now, you probably still won't even if there is zero foreigner in America.)
