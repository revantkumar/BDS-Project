Hi, As international student, I would like to say, companies like
Infosys, Tata CS, Cognizant , Accenture takes most of the jobs.
Almost 2/3 of H1B amounts are taken by them, which always hire
people without considering candidate true ability to make contribution to
this country. They only care cheap labor cost. That's how job opportunities and compensations are being harmed.

American people should fight with those guys who take despicable shortcut to steal job opportunities. Thanks.
