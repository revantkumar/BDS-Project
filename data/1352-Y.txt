A couple of questions for those oppose STEM extension:
1) How many of you are majored in engineering? 
2) How many of you would like to work overtime as other foreign STEM students?
3) How many of you have lost any job opportunity due to another foreign STEM students?
3) Suppose there are two competitive engineer candidates, one is American and the other is foreign. If you were a recruiter, which would you choose? I assume the answer is the American since the company would save money for the H1-B sponsorship.
4) Isn't US one of the strongest supporter of free competition? Why do you have bias against the equally qualified but less favored foreign STEM students?
