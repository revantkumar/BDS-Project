Xiao Chen I strongly support this new rule for the following reasons:
1. It shows the spirit of United States, i.e to give opportunity for every hardworking person.
2. Foreign students who choose to work here are talented, hardworking people. They contribute a lot for the US economy.
3. A lot of foreign students just want to gain some working experience here rather than stay here forever. They are not a threat to local workers as some people have claimed.
