Lydia Li Strongly support OPT extension.
Many companies are in short of many high-technique experts, especially in IT industry. Without the talents from foreign countries, it is not possible to find enough qualified people.

Their home countries devote so much resources and money to educate these talented students, while the US paid nothing. If they hope to contribute to the US, isn't that a good deal? 

But I have many friend went back their home country because their OPT status expired. It is actually not bad for them to contribute their countries. But if the U.S. continue "sending" back talents to compete against U.S., not in the near future U.S. would lose its attraction to foreign talents.
