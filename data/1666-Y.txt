Hello John,

American workers have already been put first, and are still being put first by new rules. This new rule includes strengthened regulations and requirements for employers, so it is better protecting American workers. Therefore, this new rule should be supported, since it retains top talent from other countries to contribute to America, making America more developed than any other country in the world, which is good.

Sincerely,
