I strongly approve that OPT period for F-1 STEM Students should be extended.

Since 2008 start STEM OPT extension, many industries like engineering have been growing smoothly. Thanks to the OPT extension, employers can hire enough talent international students and have long time to sponsor H1B visa for them. Longer legal working period and more opportunity to apply for H1B visa produce result of less employee turnover, and thus saving money for companies. Also because more STEM students can stay in the US, companies can easily find their desired employees in such a various and sufficient market of employees. Only when companies do their business well that Americans can get lower unemployment rate and lead better lives.

Some people worry that STEM OPT extension will harm native students and working Americans. There's no need to worry about that. First, American students take really small percentage of STEM students. Second, almost all companies prefer native students than international students. Only when the American students are not sufficient (because there are few STEM American students) for companies' needs that they start hiring international students.

I suggest the government and American people approve the OPT extension for F-1 STEM students. Obviously it's a win-win policy.
