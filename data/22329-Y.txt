To Whom It May Concern:

I strongly SUPPORT the 24-month extension of STEM OPT for the following two reasons:

1. It will significantly advance U.S. national interests by attracting and maintaining more talented students in STEM majors to contribute their knowledge and skills to the U.S. economy. STEM students will help boost productivity in certain business areas such as IT, reduce potential costs, and finally creating even more jobs for local American people. For example, Mike Krieger, who was born in Brazil, co-founded Instagram which not only created thousands of jobs but increased the competitive strength of U.S. IT sector in the global markets. 

2. It will not affect the career opportunities of local U.S. students. The majority of students in U.S. graduate engineering schools are international students, which means few American students face direct competition from international students in the job market. In addition to that, there is no incentive for U.S. employers to favor international students than local students. Local students usually speak better English, fit better into the working environment, and have more flexibility to switch to different companies and fields to strengthen their job skills. STEM students only serve to fill the highly demanding jobs that U.S. students either aren't interested or don't qualify. 

I hope the bill will be passed to meet the expectation of both numerous U.S. companies as well as international students. People with a clear mind would agree that global competition between countries nowadays are dependent on how many talented people a country is able to attract and maintain.

Sincerely,
Tengfei Lyu
