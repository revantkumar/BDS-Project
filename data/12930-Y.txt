This proposed rule will highly benefit US's academic achievement, and then through good application and engineering, will help prospect US's economy.

As a F1 student who involves in research as RA, I saw a lot of students who has great interests in research and made tremendously achievements in academic career. In order to make that progress, they have to continuously work on the same project, which typically lasts 2 to 3 years. And they can even dig into deeper topics and make new progress. And for many times, the project can be delayed due to many reasons. In addition, to test or polish the result, it may take longer time. So longer OPT extension will leave enough time for these outstanding students to contribute to academy in STEM subjects. 

As we all seen, in the last 20 years, technology has improved the world to be a better place. Most of the ideas and the innovations are from academic papers and patent. In such case, to provide better opportunities for these students will help improve US's economy and development. Therefore, I will strongly support this rule.
