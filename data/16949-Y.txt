I strongly support this proposal. I understand those people who disagree this proposal because of their concern that International students may take their job. 

But I do not think this should be their actual concern as if they are smart enough, intelligent enough, work hard enough, no one can take the job belongs to them. Only people who do not have a degree, or not have a decent GPA, or do not work hard worry about their job. Those people could not find a job anyway no matter who stay in America.

Also, if this is their reason to drive international students away from America, how those big tech companies can make those AMAZING things happen just with people who do not qualify for the job. 

Remember most international students are very top in their native countries, they are here to learn, then contribute to America after they graduate. If these students are driven to home after they graduate, America will definitely lose great people to create American dream. 

If those people disagree with this proposal really love the country, they should re-consider this proposal, keep intelligent international students in America, stay together and learn from each other. That is the only way to make America stronger and stronger. That is the only way to make American dream come true.
