I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

1. The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the US economic and education.

2. Diversity is very important for the U.S, as the students get training in US company during extended OPT, so the students would learn and interact with real Americans people they would form strong bond with USin such way, Us would benefit for long term return in future.
