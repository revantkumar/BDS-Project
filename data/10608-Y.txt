Ying Wang I definitely support the new rule. One of the most important reasons that I chose United States as my destination for graduate study is the OPT extension policy which allows international students to work in the States for a while. As international students, we have spent a large amount of money for our study, and made a great amount of efforts to find internships/jobs in order to put the knowledge we learned in classes into practical use. I really appreciate the experience I have in the company I am working at right now because I have learned even more that I can't obtain in school. And I am leading a 2-year project which has been in its half-way, I just can't imagine how the project and the team would be affected if the OPT extension policy is not re-initiated as I am just starting my extension period. 

One thing I don't understand is that why many negative voices keep saying that the low wages for international students will worsen the job markets for citizens. When I l did internship in my company, I got exactly the same salary rate as the other American interns in our team. There has never been low wages for international students at all in our company. And I finally got the return offer and am paid well. As a result, I don't believe low wage will be an issue. I guess what those negative voices really concern is that they are afraid international student would be more competitive than citizens. Conversely, I think this is a good thing for United Sates's job markets as well as its economy recovery. Competitive job markets can keep the States's industries and economy growing faster and healthier.
