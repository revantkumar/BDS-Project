Andrew A. Riney Quoted from Obama "Are we a nation that educates the world's best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us?"
Unemployment always exists in our country, and it's due to multiple reasons. If we start blaming unemployment on the STEM students, we will absolutely lose some brilliant guys who will contribute to this country and potentially start up a company and create more jobs.
