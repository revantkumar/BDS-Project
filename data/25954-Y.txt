Here I STRONGLY SUPPORT this proposed rule for the reasons following:

1. Talents, regardless of their nationality, contribute much to the progress of United States, not only for technology but everyday life as well. The proposed rule will serve as a strong attraction for foreign talents, who in the end will make United States a better place.
2. United States is the country in the world owning highest standard of higher level education, the proposed rule together will attracts fair number of oversea students to come to America, which will be both economically and intelligently beneficial to United States.
3. It is diversity that makes United States unique, attracting talented people from all over the world contributes much to the diversity in United States.
