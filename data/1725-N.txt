Why doesn;t this country take care of the people in need that are legal citizens? What about helping our wounded vets?
Why do we have to support illegals? You should do more for the seniors, instead of always trying to cut social security, by the way we paid into it. If both married people paid into it & one dies what happens to all to that money?
Why are you pushing Spanish on us, ENGLISH IS THE FIRST LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY.
