When I was looking for a job in April this year, a CTO of a small company in DC said, it's easy to find a web developer, but it's hard to find a good one. Finally they offered me a job but i accepted a better one from another company. Longer OPT extension will definitely help companies, especially small companies, to find better people. With a longer OPT extension, more talented people can stay in the States and help with the development of technologies. I actually know many people who didn't get a job because of the status limitation so they went back to China and did a great job in IT industry there.
