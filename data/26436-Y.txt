I am opposed to this underhanded way of pleasing corporations at the expense of citizens. Enough of this underhanded and undermining of our rights. 

For many years we have followed blindly the STEM approach. That is what is wrong with the nation. We have a bunch of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math prodigies that are so narrowly educated they don't notice the implications of what they are doing. When we dropped real education of the populace we just followed in Nazi Germany's footsteps. Prior to WWII Germany was the leader in STEM. Just as Germany's narrow focus hurt them in the long run our national lack of fully educated adults is leading us down the wrong path. If we emphasized more history, philosophy, economics, great literature, art, etc. we would have more fully educated citizens. STEM is a backward type of education. We will have a bunch of selfish nerds. Foreign students coming here should return to their homelands to develop them. I am most happy to share them with their native country and not keep them in the USA. Offering them jobs in our country at the expense of citizens is wrong. 

Please keep the present workers in their jobs instead of replacing them with cheaper labor. This is is a no brainer decision. Send the students home to uplift their native country. We shouldn't gobble up the students for jobs here when they are needed at home. Perhaps there wouldn't be so much strife in the world if all those students returned and changed their country.
