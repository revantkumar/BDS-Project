Why are we helping F1 Students and not AMERICAN students? My grandson soon 
graduates from college, who will help him. He will soon be looking for a job.
My son is looking for work in the Tech field who is going to help him when all the Tech jobs are held by F1 or H1b visas immigrants? We are ruining our country by helping immigrants and not helping American people.
