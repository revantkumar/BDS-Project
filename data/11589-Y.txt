I definitely support the OPT proposal.

As known to all, the U.S. has opened the door to STEM international students for a long time. The reason is those international students have already been the backbone of USA's high tech industries. If the US reject to supply OPT to STEM international students, then most high tech companies will be impaired by lacking enough excellent engineers and scientists. Also the students will return to their home country which may be the strongest competent for US. It doesn't fit US's benefit absolutely. 

Therefore I support the OPT proposal.
