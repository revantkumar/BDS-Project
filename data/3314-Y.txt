I fully support the new change of increasing the F1 OPT STEM extension to 24 months instead of the current 17 months. I believe this increased duration of practical training is important for students to fully utilize the education they received. As a Facebook product manager, I know that retaining talent is of the utmost importance, and I also have witnessed spectacular coworkers and friends struggle with their visas and relocate. This measure is imperative to maintain this nation's economic, scientific, and technological competitiveness.
