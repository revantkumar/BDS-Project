We are opposed to this proposed rule change. We concur with Senator Grassely that is NOT a good regulation.

It is our opinion that these proposed regulations are inane, irresponsible, and dangerous based upon reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report issued in March 2014 finding that the program was full of inefficiencies, susceptible to fraud, and that the Department was not adequately overseeing it.

Additionally there is sufficient and accurate evidence that there are significant national security issues because the Department does not know where tens of thousands of foreign students are living and working in the country. 

We also understand that the GAO said that 'ICE cannot fully ensure foreign students working under optional practical training are maintaining their legal status in the United States.
