I support the OPT extension program. STEM students mostly work in the IT industry, and the positions in IT companies are never filled. American citizens still have decent opportunities to work for these bit IT companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and so on. Many American citizens were once immigrants. Immigrants live here, work here and contribute to the U.S. society. Without these immigrants, U.S. can never be such a powerful country. STEM students are required to work in a limited fields such as IT, Financial and Education Institutions. These fields are highly technology oriented and need foreign students to fill the working positions.
I think U.S. citizens shouldn't complain about the OPT extension. Instead, they should turn against the illegal immigrants. These people take the jobs not so skill required and makes many U.S. citizens jobless.
