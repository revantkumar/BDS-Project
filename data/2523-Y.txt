Zelun Jiang I support the extension proposal on OPT and STEM. 
The biggest reason for this action is to strengthen the economy and technology development of U.S. The positions that are filled in by students who carry F-1 Visa are left besides those that are already filled in by local people, so the extension will not affect local employment. During 2013 to 2014, 886,052 international students brought 268 billion dollars to U.S with 340,000 job positions. 
Without the support of international students, the employment market will leave a big blank with technology market week and fatigued. This will also have a great impact on the international education market, which leads to the loss of billions of dollar on U.S economy. 

The reason why so many people around the world choose to study and live in U.S is because it is a country with freedom and diversity. Everyone has the same chance to be successful by their hardworking and diligence. If the government close the door to international students, it also means it close the door to itself.
