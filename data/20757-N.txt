Jobs for Americans should come first. I am appalled that a President who promised help for the American middle class and American students should be selling out American jobs to foreign workers and placing the education of foreign students above that of Americans. Why should American taxpayers be forced to pay for foreign students to be educated for STEM jobs only to have them stay in this country and take STEM jobs from American college graduates? This is absurd. We need to develop talented technical workers here. How will importing them from other countries again and again serve the interests of American workers who are already here? If we had known that Obama would betray us again and again this way, we would never have elected him. We need to focus on STEM for American workers here, strengthen out universities to educate Americans, and provide Americans with degrees in STEM with opportunities at home. 

I oppose the Department of Homeland Security's proposed rule that would expand the Optional Practical Training program. This expansion would allow U.S. tech companies to hire foreign students for up to 3 years and avoid paying their share of payroll taxes, equivalent to 7.65% of the employee's pay. Not only does this program create an incentive for these companies to hire foreign students over qualified Americans, but it also could violate the foreign student's pledge when they received their F-1 visa to leave the country after completing their degree. With recent college graduates struggling to find work, this is not the time to provide companies with an incentive to hire foreign citizens over U.S. citizens.
