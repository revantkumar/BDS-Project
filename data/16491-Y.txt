I strongly support the extension of current training opportunities for F-1 student. These well-educated skilled students could contribute a lot not only to the technical field but also help to boost the whole U.S economics. U.S as a immigrant country, one of the reason for us to become the world largest economics is obsorbing the talents wordwide. I think we should keep this good tradition, help talent and skillful person stay in the U.S
