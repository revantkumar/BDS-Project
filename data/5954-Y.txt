I STRONGLY support the 24-month OPT extension. From the perspective of the nation, allowing more young talents in the fields of STEM to stay and work is definitely a huge advantage. And from the perspective of international students, the extension is crucial as it gives them a chance to earn what they deserve. 

A lot of people are blindly standing against this extension without even knowing the details of the whole OPT policy. Many citizens are unhappy thinking the US companies are biased to not hire them, and I personally find that thought ridiculous. I believe most of us who look at things rationally would argue that the hiring process in majority of the companies is completely performance-based and fair. Those who get the job offer are the ones who performed better in interviews. 

Even with the extension, international students are still at disadvantage because companies would prefer citizens over international students who had similar performance, and that is totally understandable since companies can deduct expenses not needing to sponsor work visa and citizenship. But further taking away the extension from international students is basically taking away the only chance for them to be able to work hard and get rewards, and only to bet on their fortune in one H1B lottery.
