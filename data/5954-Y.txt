Leo Wang I support OPT extension due to following reasons:

1. International students made great contribution to US economy as well as science and technology. It can keep US competitive by allowing international students to work here and contribute.

2. It doesn't affect the job market for American citizens since US citizens are given first considerations for jobs. 

So I support this regulation.
