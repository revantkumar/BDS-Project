You want to spend millions to try to give foreign students American jobs. Crazy. We have millions of people in part time jobs who want full time. Millions who have given up looking for Auburn job. People being forced to train their foreign replacements. And you want to entice more foreign workers into our work force. My advice. Dump this whole thing.
