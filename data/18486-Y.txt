I think the extension of the OPT is necessary for the following reasons:
1. The foreign students are good for the local economy, good for the diversity of the American culture, and efficient way for spreading the American culture.While the extension of OPT makes the chance of studying in the US more attractive for foreign students.
2. The 12-month OPT period can hardly provide any good practice for foreign students to practice the education they receive from the US universities, which is quite unfair to the students who pay a lot of tuition fee.
3. For students who are interested for scientific research, the 12-month period can hardly cover any research project schedule.
Therefore, I think is necessary to extend the OPT period.
