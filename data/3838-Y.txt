This proposal is extremely critical for international students who want to work in US. Nowadays, H1B competition is very fierce and many STEM talents have no choice but to go back to their home country, if they don't get selected in H1B lottery for twice under 17-month OPT extension currently. In that case, many high-tech companies are losing very important workforce and talent pool begins to shrink. In the long term, it will hurt US economy. Extending OPT extension to 24 month can alleviate this problem and allow international students more time to work in US and contribute more. They may win another opportunity to enter into 3rd H1B lottery if they fail twice before. Therefore, this is must-do action items that will not only benefit foreign works but also US economy. Please insist on doing the right things!! Don't hesitate! Don't step back!
