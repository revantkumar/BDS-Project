I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months.
OPT and OPT extension is important because one gets knowledge form US universities and I believe companies should get benefit from hiring new grads instead of out sourcing any work to other countries. This way both can be benefited with the hiring a young mind and a student with platform to do something.

I am very concerned with the possibility that my STEM OPT Extension might be disrupted by recent court actions, upcoming court actions, and delays in this rulemaking process. I commend DHS for working quickly to prepare this new Proposed Rule.

Most of the US universities have a lot of international students enrolled. If the STEM OPT extension is discarded, the international student enrolled percentage will go low going forward and young minds will look for other international destinations to get international exposure and knowledge. If the international student enrollment drops, this will have a severe effect on US universities as they get a lot of fund in terms of fees from an international student which is generally twice what a american student pays.

In terms of F1 students taking jobs of american students, its not true as companies hire talent from where so ever they are. Indeed hiring an international student costs them more as they many times sponsor them for H1B visa.

I believe the OPT extension of 24 months is a good step as this will give ample amount of time to F1 student to get experience and reduce pressure on H1B visa application.
