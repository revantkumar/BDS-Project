The original proposal has made very convincing arguments, and I totally agree with the critical benefits listed in section C.1. The extension has huge benefits on U.S. education systems, the technological innovation, the economic growth, and competitive power of U.S.in the whole world. Therefore I totally support to extend the STEM OPT to 24 months.
