I strongly support this proposal.

USA, as a freedom country, most of people should have equal opportunity to do contribution to this country. Who major is STEM could do a lot contribution to USA, especially in technology area. The OPT extension not only good for these students but also good for companies, companies have more time to review a person then judge if he is good for a position and make the contribution. So I do think OPT extension proposal have more benefits.

On the other hand, lots of technology area elite people in USA now used to be a F1 student, they set up many great companies, now, OPT extension could give more opportunity to these person, and companies they set up could create more work opportunity to native American.

Overall, I believe OPT extension proposal have great benefit to USA. Please approve it.
