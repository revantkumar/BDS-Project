I STRONGLY SUPPORT the STEM OPT extensions for international students in the US for the following reasons:

1) Providing working opportunities for international students will give rise to the INNOVATION of the US technology industry. A study in 2009 demonstrates that foreign highly-skilled workers and students have contributed $13.6 billion GDP and about $3 billion taxes in the year of 2008 (Holen, A 2009). A large proportion of the foreign work force is largely beneficial to the innovation of US, which is a country built by diversity and innovation. Cutting the visa extensions for international students will severely damage the ability of importing talents for innovation in US tech companies. US economical prosperity will be diminished by losing the driving force of innovation.

2) Another consequence of cutting off the OPT extension for US is that US universities will lose a large portion of tuition income. Most of the international students are financially self-supported in the US. These students have boosted the local economy by spending large amount of dollars in education and living. Not allowing international students to gain working experience in the US is as bad as saying Americans discourage international students who seek education opportunities. Lots of students will choose not to come to the US. If American Universities want to be academically competitive and financially stable, theres no way for them to not welcome foreign students.
