I hope all the US people could support this OPT extension rule. I'm working as a waiter at a restaurant close to University of Washington. A lot of my customers are international STEM students studying at UW or working at Amazon, Microsoft or other Seattle tech companies. If this proposal can't be approved, it's totally a disaster to our local economy because we would not attract these STEM foreign students to stay here. Many people, like me, working at university district would lose jobs!
