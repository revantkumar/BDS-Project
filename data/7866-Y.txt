Angie Kim I support extending OPT period. Though I am a US citizen, I don't think accepting foreign employees for working longer will do bad to our market or security. Instead, closing the US from incoming talents will do decrease the power of America. We have a strong nation, a strong army, and and powerful government. Most of these advantages comes from the STEM companies and researchers. Foreign employees play a very important role in this. So I do suggest extending OPT and make America stronger.
