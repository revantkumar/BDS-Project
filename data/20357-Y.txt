I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:
First of all, I choose to go to USA to study because that I heard we can stay here using OPT/OPT EXTENSION for working, it is an obviously important reason for many students chooses USA rather other countries and we international students pay more tuition fee and we spend a lot of money buy lots of things which will improve the economy of USA. Improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students will contract more international students go to USA and work for the company in USA, which will be good for the economy and the development of technologies.
Next, I read some comments that said international students will let the citizens loose their opportunities. I don't think they need to worry about loosing their opportunities because the expanding just for STEM international students who work in the related industry not for all the international students. Secondly, we know that USA is a big country while the population is limited, and citizens can do many kinds of jobs it is because the new technology company needs people so that international students can have the opportunities working in there.
International students will improve the US economy and actually do NOT take American students' jobs.
