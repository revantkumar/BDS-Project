Pragmatism is needed on this issue. The population of the USA is aging; unlike previous generations, my generation has not produced a surge of young people growing up to keep our economy and nation strong. We are a nation of immigrants. Respect who we are at our core, and extend and expand F-1 visas.

I have plenty of personal experience with students from other countries who study in the USA. Over the past 20 years, they have been my co-workers, my rentors, my friends, and my guests. I have have experience them as intelligent, ambitious, hard workers. I have appreciated their respect and I have welcomed them into my life. I expect my country to make that welcome an official USA policy by extending and expanding F-1 visas.
