I strongly SUPPORTthe proposal. 
One of the main reason that international students choose United States over ithet countries is the long OPT. The extension of OPT will make US even more attractive. The increase of international students will lead to the development in higher Education along with the prosperity of local economy. Many job opportunities are created to support them. In the meantime US citizens with equal capabilities are still more competitive injob hunting. Obviously extending OPT does more good than harm.
