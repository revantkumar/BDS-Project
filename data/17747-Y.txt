This is important to the high tech companies because they rely crucially on high education engineers and scientists, and a lot of whom are foreign students. If we don't give these high level engeneers and scientists a chance to stay and contribute to the country, we will lose our leadership in science and technology. It is not a good idea to drive all these intelligent people back to serve their own countries, and compete with us.
