I am completely at a loss as to why this is even being considered! So many young Americans out of work and struggling after years of college and you want to bring more foreign workers here?? What the hell has happened to this country in the last 7 years?? Who knows....maybe it'll be one of YOUR children who gets overlooked for a foreigner who has done NOTHING to earn being here much less WORKING here. STOP this action NOW. PLEASE
