I strongly support the rules of improving and expanding the training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and Cap-gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. Because this policy is good for both the United States and F-1 students. F-1 students are educated in colleges and graduate schools. They are talented and a great source of workers for US companies. With more talented workers, the companies can do better and the overall US economy will do better. OPT will also provide better training to the students themselves, which will also attract more foreign students come to study in the US. Overall, I strongly support this rule.
