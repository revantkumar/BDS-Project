Dear all,

As an international student, now working at Fremont, California,of course, I DO SUPPORT the opt-extension.

First of all, the OPT-extension is very necessary for USA. As we all know, in the past recent decade, the High-tech industry has contributed tremendous growth to the USA economy. And to be honest, who works in the high-tech industry, of course, most of them are immigrants. Without OPT-extension, in my opinion, almost all the high-tech companies, especially Google, Apple and Facebook etc., would fall into difficult and awkward circumstances, that is severe lack of necessary skilled stuff, and of course they are STEM people.

In addition, the idea that STEM immigrants really take the place of citizens, I think, is simply ridiculous. As a matter of fact, students in STEM schools, especially in graduate schools, are almost international students. I don't why, but the fact is that it seems like the Americans do not like STEM subjects or they are just simply not good enough to get in a graduate school. In another word, the United just do not have enough STEM talents. And the STEM students and immigrants just fill this blank.

In conclusion, the United do need the STEM immigrants!!!
