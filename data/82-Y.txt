Providing OPT extension will make the US economy benefit. It looks like the extension will make more job opportunities occupied by aliens, and citizens' benefits will be compromised, but there is one point that needs to be noticed, which is the aliens that are accepted by companies to work on opt, are the ones that are considered better fit the positions than citizens. Here is the question, if there are citizens that can better fit a job, why should companies pay money and through legitimate process to hire an alien? So providing opt means providing the opportunities for companies to keep more qualified alien employees, which will surely benefit the overall US economy.
