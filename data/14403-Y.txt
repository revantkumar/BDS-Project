STEM OPT extension ensures sufficient talents for companies.

Do a simple math. In a typical statistic department, only around 20% of the graduate students are domestic. (Yes, that's true. International students are actually dominant in most graduate STEM programs)
Suppose in one typical year, there're 50 graduate students graduating, out of whom 40 are international. 25 international students intended to stay and find a job. They're good, and they're not picky about jobs, and they don't change jobs often. 
So there're 35 students trying to find a job, 10 domestic, 25 international. If there're 35 vacancy, then everyone's happy. 
However, now there's no OPT extension and only 10 international students decide to stay and hunt a job. There would be 15 vacancies that can't be filled. 
What can the employers do? 
Option 1, wait another year for more domestic students to graduate. (10 more domestic students and )
Option 2, hire 10 graduate students from less prominent universities.
Option 3, hire undergraduate students. (since the proportion of domestic students is higher in undergraduate programs, there're more domestic applicants there.)

Obvious, none of these options is satisfying. U.S. companies relies pretty much on international STEM students to fill their positions. I don't think it's a good idea to cancel their OPT extension.
