I strongly support the 24 month OPT extension. It is unjust to break down the opportunity and will for those who want to do contribution the United Stated. Each year, many international students stay in United to support this country especially in High tech company like Google. I can't image if this extension is stopped, how could those companies survive, how could those companies contribute to U.S continually. Moreover, diversity is very important in United State. Many famous scientists were international student at their beginning of the research. Jiawei Han, the professor in UIUC started his research career as an international student. Now, he is the academic pacesetter of Data mining. Different cultures and study will help the development of this country. However, I think the extension or H1b policy still need to be optimized. DHS should strictly track those companies which file duplicate H1b applications and block those companies from the H1b pool. The stem college should be restrict to Top 100 university because some universities abused this extension to make profit. To be concluded, I strongly support this 24 month OPT extension and also wish it could be optimized in the future.
