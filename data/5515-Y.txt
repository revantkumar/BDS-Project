Opinion: The OPT extension is necessary to our country's industry.
To those who holds the opinion that the OPT extension would harm to the US, just think of how the USA develop and grow to such a great country: it's just because of its openness and inclusiveness. It attracts so many talented people around the world to come to US and contribute to the US. The highly educated immigration would never do harm to a country and the people. Mostly, all the citizens would benefit from this, the country needs these technical immigration to develop the high tech industry and help the US to get out from the swamp of financial crisis. The country is getting better these years after 2008, and I can't imagine what bad things would happen if the country's industry lose too many well skilled workers to support the companies' operation, just because of the cancellation of OPT extension.
