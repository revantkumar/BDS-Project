Lawra Liu From the statistic data of our college, the number of international students has dramatically increased in recent years. In my opinion, an important reason for such choice is that U.S. provides a better opportunity of training to international students after they graduate from colleges or graduate schools. Such professional trainings in industry are very important to international students, because it greatly improve their competition ability when they go back to their country to find a good job. However, without the STEM OPT extension, this post-graduate training will be reduced by 67%, which would greatly devaluate the education in US to international students, thus decreasing the chance of education institutions in this country to attract the best students. This would be a lost to international students, but a bigger lost to US education institutions.

In addition, what would happen to the high technology companies? Usually the international students who can find a job or intern in industry are the smartest, hard-working and most innovative ones. They want to do their best to contribute to technology development in this country, because this country could provide the best platform to them. However, cutting down the STEM OPT extension would deprive their opportunity to make contribution, since one year is too short for most researches, and this will finally hurt the whole system. 

I believe this is the best time for doing research in science and technology, and U.S. has the best system for doing this. STEM OPT extension is a critical part of this system, since many brilliant international students have chosen to come here and made tremendous contributions to this country.
