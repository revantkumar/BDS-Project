Extending STEM optional practical training to total of 3 years definitely helps a lot to both applicants themselves but also big companies in US. Applicants can gain more experience related to their major and contribute their part to US companies to get stronger with the up to date knowledge from school. This new policy will attract more genius from all over the world to America I do believe.
