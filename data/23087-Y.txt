This is an excellent amendment decision by the DHS, resulting from the court ruling that vacated a 2008 DHS regulation of OPT extension. I completely support this amendment!

It is common knowledge that companies in STEM fields perennially face shortage of highly skilled employees, and suffer as a result of this dearth, which in turn affects the economy. There are over 5 million jobs in STEM 
(http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2014/02/05/report-stem-job-market-much-larger-than-previously-reported) 
and a lot of those go unfilled every year because of lack of skilled employees; there are just not enough US citizens who are able and willing to fill these positions. Over 4 million STEM jobs go unfilled each year (http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real). Over 500,000 skilled positions are unfilled

Thus OPT (and H1B) is not just an opportunity for students on F1 visa, it is an economic requirement of this country. For e.g. more than half of silicon valley workers are OPT and H1B workers, and the economy there is highly dependent on OPT and H1B workers. The same is true of many other economic and tech hubs in this country. Unfilled positions means billions of dollars lost (http://www.businessinsider.com/industries-with-unfilled-jobs-2014-11).

Given that H1B visas are limited in number and each year the number of applicants are high, there is a 1 in 3 chance of getting an H1B visa during one fiscal year. As a result, without the OPT extension, 2 out of 3 STEM workers would have had to leave the country, and work in another country and compete against us. This 24-month STEM extension provides a much needed relief for such workers, and a chance to apply for H1B in next fiscal year. In addition, OPT will also drive wages up, as STEM workers on OPT have a much better flexibility of changing jobs, and a much better opportunity of wage in
