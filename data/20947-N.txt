To whom this may concern,
Most all Americans are willing to help other countries in need, some even go as far as opening up their homes to people they barely or don't know as an act on kindness. I among millions of Americans believe the work visas do help but the drastic moves made recently by this current administration only further hurt our economy. 
We as a nation have yet to climb out of the last depression that came close to crippling our country and with another move like this one it drives another nail of prevention hendering our economy from making any type of recovery. 
Favoring foreign workers and giving them more opportunities than legal citizens and rewarding greedy corporations is Not leading as a leader should. 
There are plenty of well qualified individuals here legally that need jobs and all of you in DC know this to be a fact. 
Back room and side deals controlling and making your decisions have come to light and plenty of Americans are disgusted with all of it including myself. We expect better more qualified choices and decisions coming from those elected to represent the People, if any of those individuals currently in DC are unable, it does look that way to the majority, to fulfill what you were elected to do and can not up hold your Oath of office without finding loopholes around doing it correctly Please step down and aside so that 'the People' can elect someone more qualified that can do what your failing to do.
