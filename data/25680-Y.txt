I adherently support this rule as in this era of globalization we should have no rule that would restrict the use of skilled people any where accross the globe. U.S being the country which gifts new technology to the world, must not put some restrictions to make use of skilled professionals in their country. No offense to Americans here... Skilled professionals can be any where across the globe... It's just making choice out of people available to work.
