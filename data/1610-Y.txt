I strongly support the proposal. I am a master student in Imaging Science now. The most important thing that attracted me to pursue a graduate degree in USA is that OPT offers enough time for us to obtain valuable experience in industry to be competitive when I go back to my home country. One year OPT is usually not enough for STEM student to finish a complete project. As I knew in career fair, many company are recruiting students to involve a project for more than one year. The companies don't like students to quit when they just get familiar and skilled with their work. Therefore, I stand for the extension of OPT which could give international students an opportunity to expand their education benefits.
