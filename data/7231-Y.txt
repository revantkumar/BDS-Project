I strongly agree with this proposal. I think extending the OPT program is a very effective way to attract excellent students from other countries to study in the US. Now all college students are looking for internships during summer, because actually working in the position is a more effective way to learn how industry works than studying in school. Employers also favor students with high performance during their internship, because their performances when working in the company better indicate their abilities rather than their GPAs. It is really hard for a student with no internship experience to find a job after graduation. All these shows that everybody agrees that training is a very important part of learning. Therefore, it is crucial to provide international students with the same opportunity to get training.
