Teresa Mahsman United States agencies should not be giving foreign workers advantages over American workers. Despite what the government would have us believe, the unemployment rate is very, very high, probably around 25%. Lots of Americans would like to work, but cannot find suitable employment. They end up taking jobs that cannot support their families, working 2 or more part-time jobs, etc. Please don't further their agony by giving jobs to non-Americans that Americans should have. Programs such as this are subject to fraud and corruption and should be illegal. Give Americans a fighting chance to have a job in their own country! It is almost unbelievable what this government is doing to its own people.
