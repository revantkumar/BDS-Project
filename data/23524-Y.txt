I hope everyone will support this rule. It is not true that this rule will take away jobs from citizen. I think it actually creates more jobs for everyone who is interested in science and engineering. Technology changes the world and our country should retain these talents to keep ourselves as the leader of the world. For those parents who think their children's jobs will be taken away, I believe you really underestimate your children; they will become more exceptional than you would expect knowing these outstanding students from all over the world. Keep your mind open!
