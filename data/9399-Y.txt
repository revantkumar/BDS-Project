peijuan zheng Dear Sir or Madam,

Thanks for proposing the new STEM OPT.

I am currently working in an big accounting firm as IT auditor. Because of the sarbanes oxley act and the increasing demand for internal control audit,
IT audit is increasing demand. HOWEVER, the desire IT audit is someone who is equipped with IT and accounting technology while a lot of people only 
has accounting background. For example, my company was hiring a senior IT auditor recently, however, there is shortage of it. Finally, the company has 
hire someone who has three months experience. 

IF the STEM OPT canceled, I am forced to leave the company, leave the country, the company is going to face a dilemma since I am an experience or senior 
at that time. I believe it is not only me, a lot of people who is now in OPT will face the same situation and the companies will
face the same situation. It is a challenging situation since the talent are forced to leave not because they did not do it well, BUT they are faced with a not tolerant
regulation.
