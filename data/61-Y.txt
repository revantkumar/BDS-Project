I strongly support this upcoming rule since this would be a win-win to both American industry and nonimmigrant students. As a foreign student, I would certainly benefit from this rule so I can have more time finding a job in my field and exercise the knowledge learned from school in industry. This would help me in my future career if I go back to my home country. Additionally, If I want to stay in US, I would have a better chance to contribute to this society since I would have higher chance to get a H1B visa. From the US's side, if the extension of OPT is canceled, nonimmigrant students who is now working under their OPT extension would lose their jobs immediately. This would be devastating to US industry especially Tech Industry since they will lose most of their entry level even mid level employees. Secondly, US industry will not have enough trained workers in STEM if this rule is denied. As an graduate student is Engineering major, I find that more than half of my schoolmates are international students. Those native students could find a job much easier compared with us. So instead of replacing native American students out of their jobs, we are just extra resource that is available for industry since US itself doesn't have enough native graduates in these field. Moreover, from the education industry's view, it would lose millions of international students who pay expensive tuition fees if this rule is denied since studying in US would not be that attractive compared with studying in their home counties or other foreign counties.
