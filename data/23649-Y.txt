The STEM OPT extension is incredibly important for retaining international students in the United States. These students fill critical roles in the American economy and must be incentivized to study here in the US, and not in the UK or Australia. They will only do this if they have a chance of gaining employment after completing their degree.

Many US citizens with STEM degrees choose to go into non-STEM fields such as consulting, and so there is a huge gap between demand for STEM workers and people willing to work in STEM fields. If we want companies like Boeing and Facebook and Google to continue to be able to compete and win against the best companies from around the world, we must make sure that they can retain top talent, regardless of nationality. Students who have earned STEM degrees from US universities are this top talent.
