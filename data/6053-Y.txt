I support this program. If the current job market is biased, it favors permanent residents and citizens anyway. I believe money/salary is neither the only thing, nor the most important thing a hiring manager concerns about. Competition is always there in the job market, not from international students, but from talented students. I also hope this extension can benefit non-STEM F-1 students in the near future.
