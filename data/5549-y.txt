Graciela Huth Young creative minds are the biggest wealth we have. Creativity does not have nationality, it is universal and it must be welcomed with open arms. Stop causing problems for immigrant young people that want to study. When we discriminate against color or origin, we are not operating intelligently. Variety enriches all societies. Remember what the lords in GB used to do. They always tried to have extramarital children to enhance the family qualities. And many times to have children that could continue the family name. Mainly, that is a practice exercised from the beginning of our civilization among the wealthy families and also among tribes in farming societies. Our future will be successful if we remember to take care of the genetical melting pot.
