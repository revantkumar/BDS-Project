I think that's good for American companies! Because most technology companies in the States, especially those high tech companies, are hiring the international students to work on those new ideas and making a lot of fortunes. And since OPT is restricted to those companies that are e-verified, so that's not a big deal to afraid the companies would pay less and compete with local labors. And those high tech students are trained and educated in American's best high education system, why just drove them home and not let their skills and technology utilized by our own companies, which might make a great difference and create more famous products.
