It's long past time for America to give priority to American workers, instead of importing more foreign workers to lower American wages and put more Americans out of work. As long as there is graft with people in Congress willing to accept that graft we will have foreign workers displacing American workers in the work place. That is, until we elect responsible people to Congress, starting with the next election.
