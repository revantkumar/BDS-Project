I SUPPORT the new OPT extension rule with no doubt. The US has way more education resources than any other countries. The resources US graduate program put to educate international students are far more than the tuition these students pay. If we let those students go back to their home countries right after they graduate, it is a HUGE WASTE of our education resources. We need to keep them work for at least several years to contribute the economy of US. Usually the projects in the companies are at least 2-3 years long, if we kick those educated workers half way in the projects. That is another HUGE WASTE.
