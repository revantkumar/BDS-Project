Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

We oppose the OPT/STEM proposal for many reasons, including: 

- not only does the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born graduates will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need, it also categorizes the foreign-born employees in such a way that exempts them from payroll taxes.
- a 2013 study from the Economic Policy Institute found that there are plenty of American workers with and without degrees who are qualified to fill STEM jobs in IT sectors.
- Encouraging foreign-born STEM graduates to spend more time in the U.S. has one major impact, the EPI study found: wage suppression in tech-related fields.
