ersiI support the proposed rule that extends the OPT for foreign STEM students who receive their higher education in the US for 3 reasons. 
1. STEM workers are the driving force of the innovation of the technology, which is essential to the job creation and the continuous economic growth in the US. Their unique set of skills make them high in demand in high-tech and research-based industries, both have huge influence in the current economic environment. Sending the STEM students back to their home countries force those companies to outsource their work to other countries, such as India and China, because there are simply not enough US workers to supply the demand in talent. This is proved by companies keep hiring international students even though it costs companies a lot more to do so than hiring US workers.
2. The STEM students pay just as much tax as US citizens if they work in the US. If companies ended up outsourcing a lot of the work, the US would not be getting any tax by the contractors who work overseas for these companies.
3. Sending those STEM students back right after they graduate (or after one year, which isn't a motivation for most students to stay at all) is an extreme waste of the educational resources and the workforce for America. Even worse, the ability to be trained on the job after they graduate is a huge motivation for the foreign students to choose American universities to begin with. If this proposed rule could not not go through, it is almost certain that the admission to American institutions for the following years would drop drastically, which would affect not only the economy, but also the native US students. The tuition would rise for rest of the students, because international students usually make a significant contribution to their school's finances by paying tuition and housing. Many native students would miss out on the multicultural experience that they expect coming into colleges.
