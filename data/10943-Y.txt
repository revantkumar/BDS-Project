Most of the criticizes claiming this rule will make it harder for the U.S citizen landing a high-tech job, due to company would hire foreign student with lower salary, which is not the case in reality.
Company don't pay foreign student graduates with proficiency in STEM area lower salary compared to U.S citizen with STEM expertise, the salary is almost the same. 
In fact, companies will actually suffer from hiring OPT student, compared to hiring a U.S citizen who has the same skill set, because OPT has a period, if the foreign worker has used up the OPT period, the company has to look for another worker for the same job, which is quite costly. Therefore, if they have an opportunity to hire a qualified U.S citizen, they will definitely do so to avoid the possible cost of having the worker not able to continue work in the future.
If you are seeing those company hiring foreign student, there is one possible explanation -- there is no enough qualified U.S citizen for their job vacancy.
High-tech company is the one most advantageous point of the U.S, if they have to not hire foreign talents, it will be a great loss to the U.S economy and its technical lead in the world.
