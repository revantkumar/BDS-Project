I strongly support the extension.
As an international student studying in STEM area in the US, I am spending at least 65 thousands dollars each year. The most important reason I choose to go to university here is that I could have a chance to work in an amazing company and learn a lot. If the extension is canceled, there is no reason for the international students to pay such a huge amount of money in the US.
