I work in a large semiconductor company and we hire lots of international students who use OPT to work. They form a critical part of the company, for their innovation, their hardworking and their diversification, which is the urgent need of a growing company. As H1B caps are limited, OPT extension is necessary for them to extend the work authorization to serve the industry. Without STEM Extension, companies like us will experience a great loss as there will be serious lack of work force, and eventually the economy of the whole country will be affected. So I believe the new STEM Extension rule is reasonable and necessary.
