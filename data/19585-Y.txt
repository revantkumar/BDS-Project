YES! Definitely AGREE! We really need to keep those STEM workers! We do not have enough good worker working on STEM field.

Some people comment: 'U.S citizen should get the job', this is not a right thought, the truth is almost all native STEM students with good skills (U.S citizen) especially in CS major, they all get a good job already! Also, if I am a hire manager, I definitely want to hire a U.S citizen instead of a international student if they have nearly same performance in the interview process. But why there are still native STEM people do not have job? Well, because they are not qualify for the job! They do not have the needed skills! There are lots of international students can not find job after graduation as well. So all the comments related with 'U.S citizen should get the job' is meaningless in here. A job is a job, not a CITIZENSHIP!

Some other people saying: 'I don't have a job why DHS treat international student so well' or 'Lots native do not have a job, they should get the job not international students', these are totally wrong! The STEM job market is extremely hot right now, lots of companies want to hire more STEM people. Some people do not have job right now and put comment in here may not get degree in STEM field at all, they just want a job. So if you are not in STEM field and you have no idea with what's going on in STEM field right now, please do not put meaningless comment in here. 

Any U.S citizen who wants to have a better country with better international competitiveness and better economy should support this proposal!
