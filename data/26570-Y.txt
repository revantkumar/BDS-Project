I would strongly support this proposal because the following:

1. New OPT extension will boost US economy through increase in tuition from international students,which provides financial security to academic institutions in USA.

2. The new proposal will guarantee technology industry has enough talent and stimulate the technology innovation. It is known that technology industry always faces the shortage in labor supply, OPT extension will allow tech industry have enough talent supply and indirectly innovate new products to benefit public.

3. Even if New OPT Extension will not be approved, the market in USA will outsource more and more jobs to other countries because of global economy and cheaper labor. Therefore, it is not matter of New OPT extension will steal domestic residence jobs. In addition, there are more and more international students becoming entrepreneur to create jobs for domestic residence.
