As an international student who currently working in America, I strongly support the expanding training opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap relief for all eligible F-1 Students. 

I received my master degree for Statistics in 2014. Now I work at a great position which can let me to fully apply what I have learnt from U.S. University. I really expect to continue my career here and contribute my knowledge to America. 

From my own experiences, most of the talent people in Mathematics and Statistics are coming from China, India or some other Asian country. There is a great need for these kind of employees in the U.S. market. If we (international F-1 students) can have more time to work in U.S., more values will be created for U.S. company. We are not trying to make American citizens to lose their job, however we will fill in the gaps of some industries where most of U.S. students will never choose. For example, 98% of students for my Major (Statistic) are international students. We can make great fortune for technology industry. 

From the long term perspective, there are more advantages than disadvantages for this proposed rule.
