I support extending OPT to 24 months. With a longer OPT, more talented foreign employees will be able to contribute to the technology of US. As all we know that the science and technology is America's key advantage. This advantage is built on lots of international talents' work. For those comments that object this proposal, I just want to say: it is the quality of employees that determine the current prosperity, instead of their origin nationality. The reason why a foreign student can find a job but a native student can't is their quality for the job, ONLY. Everyone can image what will happen to US if the technology field is full of low-quality employees.
