I strongly support this expanding OPT regulation get approved.

As potential F1 student parents, we have multiple choices to send our children to study in USA, UK, CA or GERMANY, the tuition fee in USA is the most expensive one, but why today we still take USA education as our first choice, one of the major reasons is USA provide not only better academic education and also perfect job training, if this policy is cancelled, I am afraid we will choose other country as our children's first priority. Believe me, I am not alone, there are so many parents have same thinking.

More F1 students, not only more contribution to the development of US Universities, and also bring more income for the country. Please seriously consider it and get this regulation approved, thanks!
