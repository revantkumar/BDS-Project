Rev.June Anne Garber It is definitely time for all of America's borders refuse entry to any more, not even one, illegal aliens as our nation has job opportunities which should be given to our own citizens instead. President Obama should have never made any laws or decrees or promises to anyone to receive what our own citizens deserve. 
It is definitely time for you all to listen to the constituency and these pleas.
