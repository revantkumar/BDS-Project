Actually, there is no specific evidence that the annual employment rate of international students is booming because of OPT. As international students now are chosen randomly to get H1B, the so-called bad effect of OPT that jobs for Americans will all be occupied is exaggerated. What's more, the cooperation between international students and native students during OPT is good for the development of cross-culture communication and economy in the United States.
