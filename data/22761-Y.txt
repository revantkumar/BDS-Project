I strongly support this proposal because

1. Extend OPT does not increase the number of people who will eventually obtain an H1-B visa and stay. Most foreign employees will end up leaving USA

2. Though OPT job seeker may be willing to take lower salary, that does not make them more competitive. This policy is for S.T.E.M. - intelligent jobs - which requires considerable time and training cost till the employee starts to make serious contributions. Thus, employers would not like hire someone with a time restraint unless they are capable or potential enough to worth the risk.

3. Since most foreign OPT employees will leave in a few years, they would not take dominant/top positions away from US citizens. However, they will work for the industries and spend the most money they make here, which is a very positive contribution to US economic
