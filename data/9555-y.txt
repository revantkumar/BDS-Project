Yuchen Dai I support this program. The OPT STEM extension can help the US firms recruit more ENTRY-LEVEL new hires and enhance the competitiveness. The US citizens do not get harmed in the job market because they have great advantages during the hire process, including the communication skills, culture and risk of work authorization. 
The fact is that the US firms need the foreign workforce. Many firms are suffering inadequate qualified appliers. The qualified means they must reach the basic technical boundary. Whoever doesn't meet are not acceptable because they will not improve the productivity but instead spoil others' work. 

US citizens have backgroud advantages once they meet the requirement. However, the number of US citizens cannot reach the number of entry-level workers need by firms because it is a so large job market. The job market is growing even larger due to the creativity and leading position of the US firms because of the social inclusion.
