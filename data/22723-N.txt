It is unfair to US citizens to promote a program that financially I cents employers to hire foreign workers over our own citizens. There is no reasonable justification for jobs in the US to not be subject to payroll taxes just because they are filled by non- citizens. Classifying them as "training" or any other designatin is just smoke and mirrors and another example of creating loopholes to favor cronyism. The ratio of workers paying into social security has been shrinking consistently versus those receiving benefits and to now favor foreign workers filling US jobs, not requiring them and their employers to pay these taxes, is against US workers and exacerbates the funding challenges for these entitlements. It is wrong, not needed, and I'd unfair to citizens. Our officials duty is to represent the interests of our citizenry firs and fore,out and this perverted agenda is wrong.
