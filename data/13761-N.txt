The original purpose of the OPT program was to train foreigners and send them home. I want to know why it's being used to displace American workers with the cheap foreign labor we train? Why is it that the OPT program has denied 430,000 Americans jobs from 2009 to 2013? Why has the OPT program taken $4 billion dollars from the social security and medicare trust funds when these funds are becoming insolvent?
