As long as there are Americans who are unemployed, many of whom are Veterans, there should never exist a program that favors hiring immigrant of any kind. We owe our returning Veterans everything and it is way past time that we acknowledge that and start treating them like the valued Americans they are. Start putting all this effort into helping our own and there will be no reason to import any workers which is ludicrous.
