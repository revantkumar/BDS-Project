The OPT extension is not only important for students but also more important for many US companies that need employees with good engineering and science ability. A large part of them are non US citizens. Also, universities spent a large a mount of money for supporting the studies and researches of international students. If they can not stay US for contributing for the development of US. This is a big money loss for US. So I really hope the government can allow this OPT extension.
