Why or why would you allow this? I oppose offering any more visas. I have a four year degree, almost an $80,000.00 debt in student loans. And I can't find a job that pays well enough to start paying my loans. Now I have to deal with another issue, family brought here or born by illegal parents having their children obtain free education to fight for my place in the work force. How could you not see what is wrong with this picture?
