I strongly support the OPT extension proposal for the following reasons:

1. It allows students who study in the US to contribute to the economic growth of the US after graduation.

2. It adds diversities to the US.

3. High tech companies really need STEM extension.

4. For myself, my project requires at least 2 years to complete after graduation.
