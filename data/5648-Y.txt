Mike Wang I feel like expanding OPT has more benefit to US than any other potential disadvantages. Students with advanced STEM degree(M.S., Ph.D.) are talent and diligent. They have spent a few years here at US to pursue the degree, and they deserve the opportunities to reward what they have learned to industry and society. Expanding OPT opportunities ensure this and reduces the cases in that talent students are forced to leave US without contributing to our nation. I wish the act of improving and expanding OPT could get processed smoothly. Besides the reasons stated above, I personally wish to have more opportunities to contribute to the nation where I spent years on both life and work.
