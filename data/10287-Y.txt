I strongly support the proposed rule and can speak from personal experience of the hiring process in the STEM industry. 

I work for a research company in Boston, focusing on quantitative techniques. We employ a lot of computer science, statistics and mathematics in our daily jobs. Employees here hold various STEM degrees (from Bachelors to PhD) from prestigious institution including MIT, Harvard, etc... At the beginning of the year, some of my colleagues left the company that opened up entry-level positions for hiring. Because of the complications in H1-B visas, the clear priorities have been given to citizens and green-card holders. STEM-degree foreigners were usually put aside or required a much higher standard. The positions are left vacant until today, November 3, 2015 (more or less 8 months). The candidates we have interviewed really struggled during our technical rounds and hardly any passed the first round. We have eventually resorted to interviewing foreign STEM candidates and begun to find good fits for the positions but are still reluctant because of the current STEM / H1-B situations. 

This personal anecdote is common for firms in my industry if you have time to chat with their HR's. Having read previous comments, I want to draw several points from the anecdote above:
- Many are confusing STEM foreign graduates (masters, PhD, researchers with publications) with low-skilled cheap IT labors involved in recent H1-B scandals. The former are intelligent skilled talents that contribute ideas and can generate jobs for America. We pay these individuals well or else they can easily go to our competitors. 
- While there may be a good supply of local STEM workers (as we can still find local candidates), we are seeing shortage in the highly skilled talents (as we cannot find any to hire) that have our demanded qualifications. Again, we will not lower our bar just because of work authorization issues. This highlights another point: many previous comments rely on the
