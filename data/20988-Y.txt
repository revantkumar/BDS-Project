I consider this proposal as an act to steal jobs from the US citizens and permanent residents. This country don't need more foreigners to steal our opportunities and high paid salaries. Truly talented people are able to stay, but longer the students practical training is not right and not fair for US citizens. United States are already so generous to give 1 year practical training for all students, now we are going to extend that to 3 years? And takes even more opportunities from our own? I don't think so
