I strongly support this new rule for improving and expanding work authorizations for non-immigrant students with STEM degrees. Most people worried that these international workforce may take jobs over unemployed U.S. people. However, most STEM jobs in this discussion are highly skill-related and required higher education degrees, while few unemployed U.S. people are qualified. Also, the existing policy of optional/curriculum practical training has been proved extremely beneficial for U.S. higher educational institutions like universities, and for U.S. employers as well. The improved training opportunities will encourage more international students to study abroad at U.S. and thus help relief U.S. university education costs and tight budgets. It will also provide huge skilled workforce pool for every u.s. industry.
