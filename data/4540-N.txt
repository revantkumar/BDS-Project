"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to amend its F-1 nonimmigrant student visa regulations on optional practical training (OPT) for certain students with degrees in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) from U.S. institutions of higher education. . ." is clearly another example of the abandonment of this administration of the American Citizen in favor of citizens from outside the U.S. 

As a parent of one Computer Science graduate with a 4.0 GPA that was denied employment at the hands of this act of "war" against the citizens of America, we can only summarize that our government is consistently working against those that they PROMISED to Represent and serve. There are thousands of graduates who are citizens that are unable to obtain employment in their field because of the favoritism given to citizens of other countries, so how can this be contrived unless damage is desired for America and our People. Competent Americans should have first priority.

I do not believe that they have the competence to recognize the wrong that they inflict, or the damage to the country as a whole.
