Siddharth Vasudevan I strongly recommend the extension of OPT stem program as it gives the ground level working knowledge for the people who are studying under the STEM courses, this is important as it not only gives an industrial experience to the students but also the companies can gain fresh ideas from the young talents who are ripe with creativity. This is beneficial for both the students and for the company which is one of the factors that affect the US economy.
