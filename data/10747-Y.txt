Wenbin Kuang I strongly support this proposal, and I believe that It's just a joke for those people to say "leave the jobs for hard working Americans" simply because they ain't totally hard working at all, which has led to the present situation of the U.S. After World War II, the U.S. became incomparably powerful in the world, thanks to introduction of highly educated foreigners. The diversity of culture and knowledge made the U.S. glorious and magnificent. If we now chose to lock the whole country away from the world, our fates would be in the shadow and gloom.
