It is clear that this program hurts not only young Americans job prospects by preferring foreign students who work cheaper, but American seniors as well. Employers save 7.65 percent when they hire foreign students instead of US workers because they don't pay FICA or Medicare taxes under the OPT program. OPT workers often hold jobs in the $60-$90,000 a year range, but they cost Social Security about $1 billion dollars a year. 

The OPT was originally supposed to give foreign students tools they could use to improve things in their homelands when they returned.
