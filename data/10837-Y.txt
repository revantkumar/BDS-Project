Jack Qi Strongly support
1, Most of those students who want to live here are elites, which can improve social efficiency.
2, Everyone is equal. If you can prove that you can fit for the high income job, just compete with those guys, using political barriers to them shows you weak. The history shows that using political tools is a bad idea.
3, The USA is a immigrant country, which means your ancestors were in the same situation as they have now, if you are against the policy, you are against your ancestors.
Don't be narrow minded!
