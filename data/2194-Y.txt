I finished my MS degree in Engineering and am actively on my OPT program. I'd say the new OPT extension is great for both sides. First thing off, it attracts more foreign students in STEM major to US. The OPT program is one of the most important reason I chose to pursue my degree in US. 

The point that OPT students are less expensive than US citizens is totally off. Most OPT students are interns, which means they get paid less. And, OPT students do contribute to more federal tax, and companies do have to spend more money on legal issues for foreigners like me who are on OPT program. The point is simply that, with so many hi tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc thriving and expanding, they need more talented labor than does only US citizens can offer, or at least in the short term.
