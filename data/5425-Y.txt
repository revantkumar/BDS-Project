Richard Hurst This policy will definitely help more high educated inter national students stay, especially those with a degree in STEM, which is what the U.S. has been looking for in all this years to grow its economy. Some of you may think this will make it more difficult for Americans to find job themselves. But you may not know that most of students majored in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in the universities are from abroad. The economic growth needs this type of work force to stimulate either research new technologies or large construction projects. Those students with STEM degrees will definitely bring more opportunities in the US and make US economy more robust. 
Also, this STEM policy will attract more students to further study in the US which will bring significant income for those universities. 
I totally support this policy!!
