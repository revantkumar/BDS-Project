I strongly support this new rule.
I believe stem opt is important to the leading technology companies/industry in the United States. They need international students to fill the increasing demand for tech talents. As for me, I am a student majoring in electric engineering. The OPT STEM, which allows me to work for more than 1 year,really attracts me a lot. Without this OPT STEM, I do not think that US could attract so many foreign STEM students to contribute to various industries every year.And also US companies have benefited a lot from the increased number of STEM OPT students. Foreign students will help the local economics, e.g.rental, restaurants, entertainment.In a word, I believe that it is a mutually beneficial policy.
