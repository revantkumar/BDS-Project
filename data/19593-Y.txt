I think the STEM program should add User Experience designer in it. I am studying for MFA Design, specially in interaction design, which is not in STEM of course. But when I graduate, I will definitely go to a tech company and work as a UX designer, which is a necessary part of tech team in company. Why are UX designers doing the tech job but we are not enrolled in STEM program?

I really love my school (California College of the Arts) and my major. When I was interning at Google, I think what I learned from school is definitely more helpful than other HCI major. Most HCI (Human-computer interaction) majors are in STEM. I would not deny that HCI is important for UX design. But I think design thinking, which mostly HCI students in universities don't have, but design college would teach us, is far more important than the basic knowledge of HCI. That is to say, I think HCI is the base, design thinking is more valuable than that in UX design. But design major is not in STEM! I think it is totally unfair for design students who will work for tech companies. Why we are not in STEM? Design is not only graphic design or visual design. We are designing for websites and apps. We are tech employees, not business or art. But engineers are all in STEM. UX designers, a super important role in a team, are ignored.

Thus, I highly recommend you to do some research on which art colleges are teaching interaction design major for tech positions. As far as I know, all of them are not STEM. I think that is unfair for UX designers who graduate from design major and work for tech companies rather than HCI. Not enrolling design majors in STEM means you are encouraging students to learn less valuable major, which is less valuable for tech industry.
