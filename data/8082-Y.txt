Xiaoka Xiang I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1. This rule only increase the possibility of educated people to staying in the United States. It is good for the United States to have more highly educated people, especially in science and technology field. Unlike those opponents' words, highly educated workers will not prevent local people from being hired, but will help to expand the entire market size of high tech or even create new market, and thus lead to larger job market in both technology and related services field.

2. Currently more than half of the graduate students, especially PhD candidates,in science and technology subjects of most of the top universities are foreigners, and they are among the top talents in their home countries. Increase their opportunities to staying in the United States will result in that they contribute their skills and taxes to the development of the United States instead of other countries. This will help our country to stay strong in the competitive world; this is of the well-being of the entire country.

3. Immigrants from this rule will never be illegal.The prosperity of today's America is based on numerous immigrants who chase the American Dream back decades ago.It was America's spirit and we shouldn't let it disappear.The United States is never a nation that does not value positive competition and hard-working people no matter what their nationality is, and is always giving hard-working and talented people a welcome.
