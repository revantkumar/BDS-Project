I strongly support the new OPT extension proposal.
First of all, anyone should not deny that STEM students have made really huge contributions to our country. They didn't steal jobs from us, they do help our country to become better and better in many industry fields such as IT, science etc. Without them, many companies would suffer the loss of the absence of skilled employee. Secondly, not all of the STEM students can find a job, but only those who have passed strict interview can. Also, students working on OPT pay tax and they help with local economies.
