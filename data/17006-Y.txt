After reviewing the whole regulation purposed rule, I strongly support the 24 months OPT extension for F-1 Students. Firstly, these young graduates would create considerable wealth for the government and enterprises. In many companies, large amount of employees are in their OPT extension statusand they are playing very important roles. If the OPT extension policy is invalidated suddenly, enterprises will encounter a huge "brain drain" as well as economic losses. On the other hand, students both domestic and international, should enjoy equal rights in education and work. The 24 months OPT extension would provide them more opportunities to get working experience as well as help them to apply their knowledge to life. In conclusion, 24 months OPT extension would bring a win-win situation to the US government and international students. So I absolutely support the proposed rule.
