Expanding STEM OPT is very important for us international students as well as US technology and economy development.

I'm currently working in Google with OPT. I'm developing new technologies for Google as well as make billions of dollars for Google. As we know, a large percent of people working in tech are international. From US perspective, the demand of STEM students in job market far outweigh the US citizens studying STEM. If many brilliant international students got educated in US but didn't have a chance to work for US, it's both a loss of US industry and a waste of education resources. From our perspective as international students, we'd like to develop ourselves in good tech environment in US as well as give back to the country who educated us.

As the number of people applying H1B visa increases, the opportunity for us to get selected by H1B lottery decreased dramatically. I didn't get selected this year even with an advanced degree from US college. According to some statistical calculation, only around 30% of students with only bachelor's degree got selected in H1B lottery and around 60% for students with an advanced degree. With only 1 year OPT, most of us are gonna kicked off if we failed the lottery once. Expanding OPT will definitely increase our opportunities to get selected by applying multiple times.

There are so many stories and evidences about how diversity and opening have made US the strongest country in the world. And well educated international students are going to keep making this country better. We really appreciate your effort to expand STEM OPT in the way proposed.
