Not letting someone exercise/practice what they learnt is like telling them telling them to forget it. Yes, they can go back to their respective countries to exercise it. However, there must be a reason they chose to come to this country to learn those skills, there are probably more opportunities to learn here. If they are allowed to come and learn those skills by investing hefty amounts they should get opportunity to practice those skills for some MEANINGFUL duration, before they go back to their country and practice/start something using those skills.
