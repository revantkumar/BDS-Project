Li Yu I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:

The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S.. Taking myself as an example, I was a foreign student just graduated from MIT as an EECS Ph.D., which took me more than 6 years with numerous publications. Within my field, I am definitely one of the experts making huge contributions to U.S.. Unfortunately I was not be able to pass the H1B lottery and the OPT is very important to me. I believe if we pass this rule, I could further making more contribution and thus we could create more job openings both to US citizen and aliens.
