I think the extension of OPT will successfully define what United States of America is again. As a land of free and equality, every man and woman should get a better opportunity to show the world what is he/she capable of. As the pioneer of freedom and independence spirit, this great nation shows the entire earth the right way to evaluate individuals by their ability and heart, no matter where do they come from. This is what keeps American being strong and doing well. 
With longer time of working experience, good people can get a higher chance of being selected to serve this country by their will, while others will also be evaluated more accurately by longer term of working. As an international student, I got an opportunity to get access into one of the top food production companies in the country during my school year. I've learnt so much for the past 1 years and if I am allowed to work in U.S, the company doesn't even need to train me anymore. And I do believe there are many like me that with great experiences and abilities with top companies, all they need is a better opportunity to express themselves in different fields. If we have to leave against our will, the knowledge and experiences we've learnt here will not belong to America anymore, that will be a great loss of both this country and us, which dose also against our will. Thus why I think the 2 years extension of OPT is a easy and efficient way of keeping this country great with less paying.
