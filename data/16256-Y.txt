In my opinion, expanding OPT is necessary. Consider an international student just graduated from school and found a job in the US. With the help of OPT, a company could hire this student even though the student is not lucky enough to have a H1 visa upon the graduation. However this win-win situation may not continue since the OPT is too short to allow the student to have enough time to get a working visa. Thus as a consequence, the company may lose a hard working employee, and this student will lose his or her job. This kind of dilemma can be relieved by expanding OPT and this is a necessary step to improve the efficiency of using international resources in the society of the United States.
