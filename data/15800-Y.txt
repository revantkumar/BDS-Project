I strongly oppose this rule. We have enough qualified candidates in the US with proper written and spoken English. Some of the comments here have grammatical mistakes.
Please consider the level of candidates, you are letting in. Cities are getting crowded, traffic jams everywhere, schools are over crowded. The infrastructure is falling short in major cities.
