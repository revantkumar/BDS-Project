I strongly support the proposal for the following reasons: 
The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S. Not to against to U.S. Quote from Mr. Presidents : Are we a nation that educates the worlds best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? The answer apparently is a NO. 
Competition does exist between the citizens and international student. However, competition always make positive impact to the improvement of skills and personal development. Without competition or over protecting workers may result in foster laziness and lifelessness. Moderate competition are necessary. 
The proposed changes will also benefit colleges and universities remain globally competitive in attracting international STEM students to study and lawfully remain in the United States. More and more student are coming to United States to study not only because the best technologies in the United States, but also they think its the way they can live and work for the freedom country. The extension give them more opportunities to integrate to the best country in the world. The longer they stay, the more they will be influenced by this country. This proposal eventually will benefit globalization of the world. 
Diversity is very important for the U.S. As an immigration countries, the country should be more open and let more outstanding graduates live and work in U.S.
