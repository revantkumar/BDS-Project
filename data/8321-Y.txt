Americans first! As a truck driver I have experience too many individuals from other countries driving commercial vehicles whom can not speek english, unable to follow directions and having accidents. Many are on visas, get paid less than the average truck driver and im sure the companies whom hired them are getting a tax break. Now our government is allowing this practice in our high tech industry. Really??? This only helps big business and hurts both Americans and foreigners. Fix our imigration Front door first. Allow them only 6 months working experience.
