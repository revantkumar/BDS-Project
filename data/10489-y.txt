Kaili Chen I believe expanding OPT for F-1 STEM students will bring the following benefits:
1. STEM students will increase domestic consumption, including food, entertainment, housing and tourism etc. This will lead to more job opportunities. According to NAFSA, 2013-2014 international students contributes $26.8 billion to US economy and creates 340,000 jobs. 

2. Firms hiring STEM students need more than 1 year to train the new hires. Typically, STEM major jobs need more time to learn and put knowledge to corresponding industry. If STEM students have to leave after 1 year, the loss to the firm is big. 

3. Expanding STEM OPT will attract more international student for higher education in US. This will increase the diversity within universities and improve academic innovation.
