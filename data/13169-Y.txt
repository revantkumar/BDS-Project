Extending OPT from 12 months to 24 months will give a great help to America. Since many international student cannot get a H1B VISA, more OPT means they can stay longer in USA. Stay longer means they will pay more tax to the government, so the economical situation will be better. Furthermore, foreign STEM students can make contribution to technology innovation in US, which means more convenient life and more job opportunity. We need them to stay.
