To whom it may concer,

As a PhD student for STEM degree, I do believe that prolonged opt period is necessary for the students within their program, because the specialty of the STEM majors. For those majors, the practical experience actually should be considered as part of the extension of the PhD program. Graduate students with STEM degree need practical experience to enrich their knowledge and link what they have learnt with the industry needs. At the same time, companies also need young talents with fresh ideas to expand their business. With the advanced development of science and technology nowadays, it takes longer time for the application of those new technologies into industry, which means longer time of practical experience should be expected for the graduate students within STEM related programs. The current policy of prolonged opt is beneficial for both the industry to secure their commercial profits, and Universities to improve their graduate programs. To be honest, I see no reason that this regulation should be revised. If there is something has to be changed, the only thing I hope to is to extend the opt session as it is beneficial for both US industries and Universities.

Thank you very much,

Respectfully,
