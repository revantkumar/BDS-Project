I am strongly support to extend the OPT plan. 
1. The extending the OPT plan could properly guide students, no matter native or foreign students, to the field which are suitable for them. Someone might said that the DHS's plan ensure that foreign-born students will be taking jobs that American college students desperately need. However, it is not the truth. Most American students don't like STEM major. They have language advantage and broader social network which give them more choices in the field, like Law, business. For foreign students, in order to compete with American students, they have to study STEM which they are good at and have less competition from American students. 
2. Improving and extending the OPT plan for STEM students are not only good for foreign students who could get more chances to practice what they learned, but also enables American to keep the leading position in academic research and industrial competition in the world. My major is chemistry, simply checking the students composition in my lab will give you a rough estimation of the importance of foreign student's contribution to academic research. Among all the reasons of choosing a American university to pursue my Master degree, the leading education and the opt plan are the top 2 reasons. If the government decide to cancel this plan, it's hard to imagine how many talent students will change their oversea studying destination. Needless to say the impact of losing these talent students to those high-tech companies which are all eagerly to attract high quality employees recently. Simply cancel the current OPT plan will block more talent students which is in turn let American universities losing their leading academic position in the world and weaken the industry's innovation and competitive ability.
