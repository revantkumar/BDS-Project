I am a member of the international students community in US I am sincerely supportive of this extension not only because its potential benefit to me but also this law will not in any ways jeopardize ordinary American people's well being. Because we are not illegal immigrants but well educated creative work force for America All we ask for is an opportunity. Also the extension does not necessarily lead to more immigrants because the enrollment cap still remains unchanged.
