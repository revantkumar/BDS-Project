I support this new rule.

Those fellows leaving negative comments appear to be generically anti-immigration or anti-foreigners. But you should know, this is 'THE' tiny tiny portion of the immigrants that is well-educated, possess great knowledge and likely very respectful to our country and systems. You dislike immigrants? Fine. Go ahead to support a motion to stop illegal entries or support Trump, whatever. But if we are to drive the few most highly educated guys away, that's a pretty bad move.
