I support STEM Extension rule. I considered studying in USA because of its student friendly laws. In my opinion if there are any problems due to increased international students taking jobs companies should stop calling people from other countries to work. Off shore contracting should be reduced. They can hire students who are educated from the USA itself. This will solve the problems and will benefit international students as well as citizens.
