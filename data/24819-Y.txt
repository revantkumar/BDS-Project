I didn't plan to comment until I saw tons of negative comments from those extreme protectionism. As far as I know, the U.S. is always keeping open to all talented people to come to work and live, which is the endless power to keep the U.S. as a innovated and vibrant nation. That's why, I fully agree with the new law to extend F1 student working permission date to longer. 

For those protectionism, I have to say, if you want to live a good life in the U.S., you and your kids must work hard and study hard. Don't expect to use protectionism law to create unfair competition. If you protectionism think those foreign students and engineers are not good as you, come to Stanford, come to Google and Facebook, you will find how excellent they are and I am proud they are in the U.S. and work for us, instead of going back to their own countries.

For law makers, I would say, this is just a good beginning. You should push more to enhance equal chance for foreign students and engineers to work in the U.S.. There are still lots of obstacle to stop them from working comfortably here.
