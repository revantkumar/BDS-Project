My brother came to complete his MBA here from his native country of Croatia. He has done more than well in school, completed his degree, OPT and is now struggling for some time to maintain his legal status in order to complete this amazing opportunity of free 7 months training program with Cisco which he qualified into a group of 30 from 1300 applicants. He is also working on a start up which he invested full two years of work. None of the options give him an opportunity to maintain his legal stays but taking further classes which he has no money to do. Currently, he is running between classes he is forced to take, classes that interest him through Cisco and working on his startup. I have been supporting him for several years and my funds are running low. With all his talents, hard work and dedication he may be forced to leave next spring, unless he can find an employer to sponsor him for H-1 visa. Oh, to add an insult to an injury, I have applied/petitioned years ago for a sibling visa which may take another 10 years to obtain. Why is there no system to allow talented and hard woring individuals to stay? Why is there no system to adjust his status and apply to stay through sibiling visa as long as he can find work?
