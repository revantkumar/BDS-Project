We really need to have this kind of extension.

I am a senior software engineer and we have a lot of foreign employees in our group. Most of them come from India and China. I think it's unacceptable if they have to go home without H1B as tech companies are in urgent need of software engineers! And that's why president Obama in 2013 asked Americans to learn computer science! But for now, as there are not enough software engineers, we just need this extension to let more eligible people working for us. That's good to America's future!
