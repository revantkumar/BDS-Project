I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT regulation. 

It provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after school 
training. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college
graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist.

Many have the misunderstanding that OPT students are taking away job 
opportunities that belongs to U.S. residents. According to 2015 data. Among the filed 215000 H1B applicants, only 30000 (less than 13%) are STEM OPT students, which is the one taking away jobs from residents.
