Again I am writing to oppose this proposed rule. It is prejudice against the American worker pure and simple and is a slap in the face to the American labor force. Where is your is your patriotism--you should be putting American workers first! WITHDRAW YOUR PROPOSAL AND SHOW YOU ARE A TRUE AMERICAN AND CARE ABOUT AMERICANS WHO NEED JOBS--AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM!
