Raga Deepthi NAMBURU To
The Secretary of Homeland Security,

I write to you regarding the Notice of Proposed Rule-making (NPRM) on Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Non-immigrant Students With STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students. I am a international student studying Master's at University of Cincinnati. More than 50% of UC graduate students are international students and a vast majority of those are in the United States on F-1 visas. All the international students in the United States will be strongly affected by the Proposed Rule.

I strongly support Optional Practical Training (OPT) and the provision of an extended OPT period for STEM majors. I'm particularly excited to see the duration of the STEM OPT Extension increased in this proposed rule from 17 months to 24 months, as this would help the international students to use there academic knowledge and build a good career which would not only help for there growth but also for the economic growth of the country.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and thank you for all of your hard work in keeping America safe and providing educational and training opportunities to F-1 students.

Thank you,
Raga Deepthi
