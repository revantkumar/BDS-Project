Students with high degrees definitely bring benefits to the United States. These students have skills and knowledge. As far as I know, in my major(Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science), more than 90% percent are foreign students. These smart students are treasure to the U.S. high-tech companies. These high-tech companies, like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft etc. contribute major revenue to the U.S..
