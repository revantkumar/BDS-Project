I do support the proposal for the following reasons:
1.Diversity is quite critical for the U.S. And many talents before they make a achievement are Americans international students. U.S need those international students to make a more diversity community and obtain the advantages from other countries in order to become a more powerful nation.
2.To some extent, many international students do not compete with the local residents for jobs. I believe that reasonable and moderate competition can somewhat improve the average standard of both local residents in U.S and international people. In a long term, it can improve the competency of U.S in the global.
