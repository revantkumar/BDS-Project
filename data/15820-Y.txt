I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.

(1) It is required 3 years OPT to train a qualified STEM worker.

It provides a sufficient time window for STEM students to get after school training. 1 years practical training is way too short for training a college graduate to be a qualified engineer/scientist (compared with the 3-5 years residency periods of medical school graduates).

(2) U.S. will suffer from tremendous financial loss by revoking old STEM OPT rule and then failed to publish new one. 

Currently there are over 400000 STEM students studying in U.S. either in a 2 years master degree or in a 4 years undergraduate degree. The average tuition per year they spend is $30000. Totally U.S. education system receives 400000 * 30000 = 12000000000 = 12 billion USD per year. One of the most important reasons they choose U.S. for receiving advanced education is because it provides the best after-school training opportunity (17 months STEM OPT). If U.S. education system can not provide STEP OPT extension in the future. It will lose its compatibility to the other countries that are providing it. Considering that a considerable portion of the future students will abandon the plan to study in U.S. The educational expenses collected from them will have to be collected from other sources, which eventually amortized to every U.S. citizen. 

(3) STEM OPT does NOT take away job opportunities from U.S. resident. H1B does. Don't blame at the wrong thing.

Many have the misunderstanding the OPT students are taking away job opportunities that belongs to them. That is completely WRONG. OPT/STEM OPT is for training and serving as a part of university education only. The OPT students who want to be working in U.S. in long term has to be converted to H1B Visa, which the major contributor that takes away jobs from local residents. According to 2015 data. Among the filed 215000 H1B applicants, only 30000 (less than 13%) are STEM OPT students. The results of 2015 H1B approval a
