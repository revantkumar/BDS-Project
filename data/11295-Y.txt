I support this OPT extension for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees, not only because those students will benefit from it, but also the states will benefit from it.

I would argue that in history, the rising of any powerful country was closely related to the development of science and technology. Just to list a few: the Great Britain and the Industrial Revolution, and Germany before the World War. During the 20th century, the US has attracted numerous talented people from all over the world, and became the top-tier country in the world. The US government should try to keep those talented, well-educated and skilled STEM students so that they can have opportunity to make some contributions to this country.

Some of those who are object to this policy may be short-sighted. They only pay attention to the fact that the STEM students are competing with native workers in the job market, but they haven't realized that the country could benefit from these STEM students. First, competition could force people improve their skills and to work harder, which leads to more profits. Besides, a lot of hi-tech companies such as Microsoft and Google, are hiring a lot of people from the STEM fields, and a large portion of them are international students graduated here. Without them, these companies would make less profit, and thus less tax income for the US government.

So from my point of view, the OPT extension for F-1 STEM students is a win-win situation. For the students, they will have sufficient time to work here, to gain some working experience and to improve their skills. For the US, these students are capable to make more contributions to this country if they have more opportunity to work here.
