I support the proposed rule of improving training opportunities and expanding OPT time periods for F-1 Nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees. 

Students who participate in OPT are the ones who have offers related to their major areas of studies from approved employers. These students have proved their outstanding capabilities in their areas of studies by standing out from the recruiting process. The employment of these outstanding foreign students benefits them from gaining valuable and practical STEM work experience. More importantly, it will benefit the U.S. from utilizing these students STEM skills to maintain Americas global competitiveness in the areas of science, technology, engineering and math. With a lead in such areas, America will maintain its leading position in economy across a variety of industries in the world, which in turn will benefit the U.S. citizens overall. 

With the increasing development in the areas of STEM in their countries of origin, many outstanding foreign students may choose to return to their own countries after completing their studies in the U.S.; America will thus lose a large number of talents who would have contributed the U.S. economy and technology development if they had chosen to stay. The proposed STEM OPT extension undoubtedly will reduce the chance of losing these exceptional students and attract more qualified foreign students to seek employment in the U.S., by offering more time of temporary employment upon graduation and additional lottery chances in obtaining H1B visas. Finally, the proposal clarifies rules to safeguard the interests of U.S. workers in related fields. It reassures that this proposal will not harm U.S. workers while benefiting the U.S. for the above reasons. Overall, I support the proposed rule to improve and expand training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and cap-gap for all eligible F-1 students.
