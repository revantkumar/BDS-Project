United States will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by OPT student while studying in the United States. International students have made siginificantly contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in US. In addition, OPT students will further contribute througth research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly importatn sectors of U.S. economy.
