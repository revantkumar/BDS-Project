Why on Earth is ANYONE seeking to replace U.S. citizens with foreigners?
REPLACE is the key word here! There are over 92 MILLION Americans who can't find a job or have stopped looking as they can't find one that will pay their bills like their old job did! Disney workers were almost forced to TRAIN their replacements--replacements who were supposed to be highly trained STEM workers but the Disney employees said most of them didn't even have basic computer skills so some of the H1B program is a sham!
How about this---NO MORE FOREIGN WORKERS UNTIL EVERY U.S. CITIZEN WHO WANTS A JOB HAS ONE!! START REPLACING FOREIGNER WORKERS WITH CITIZENS THEN LETS SEE HOW MANY UNFILLED JOBS THERE ARE---I BET NOT MANY! Then the foreigners who were replaced with a citizen then has to go home as we can't afford to have them on the welfare rolls!
I know--businesses wanted cheaper labor but it's really NOT cheaper when we taxpayers have to pay over $200 BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR for social services that ILLEGAL ALIENS alone cost us and that's not counting what services we pay for people who have a worker who has a work VISA! Our taxes go up to pay for this!
This country can't not afford another 100 MILLION people on this land in 50 years---we don't have enough land--water--schools--etc. so all immigration needs to stop until we can clear our country of undesirable foreigners then see how many workers are or are not needed and go from there.
