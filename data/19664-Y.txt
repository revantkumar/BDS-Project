I am learning a lot in my opt working in investment banking. I am trying to get myself ready more quicker for doing more for the company, for the country and giving back more to the society. l'd love to so as a way to say thanks to the united states for giving me a good education. One year opt is definitely not enough for me. All I need is time, which is ganranteed by opt extension. 

I wanna say thanks to you guys. No matter who you are, where you come from and whether you need opt extension or not, please think about people's situations like me. opt extension is really valuable for our families, for the industry, and for the country.
