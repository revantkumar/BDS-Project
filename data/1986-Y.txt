I support the new rule. But it would have been much better if it was extended to 36 months instead of 24 months. If students got more time in their opt then most of the companies would likely apply for green cards directly and that would make sure the talented and experienced people could stay in United States which is necessary for creating more jobs and generating income to United States.Also this would reduce the competition for the H1-B visa lottery.
