I strongly support the new 24 month STEM OPT rule.

(1) It takes a long time to train a STEM student to become a engineer/scientist, 3 years is certainly needed. 
(2) There are numerous STEM students that are working or will be working in the STEM area in the US, revoking the OPT or the STEM extension will be devastating to the US economy. 
(3) Students that on OPT or STEM extension are not taking jobs from the US residents, the H1B does. Please read the fine prints and please don't blame the wrong thing.
