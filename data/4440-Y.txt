JIAN LI Let us calculate how much income which each F-1 student brings to USA,

1. Annual tuition plus living cost at least: USD60,000/Year;
2. Air-tickets, USD2000/round trip;
3. Parents visits, starts from selecting school, round trip USD2000*2/Time;
Hotel, local transportation and shopping are not included;

If we calculate the whole students base which is around 250000 students in USA, it is quite a lot. 

Now 30% of Chinese overseas students are in USA, followings are 21% in UK, 13% in Australia, 10% in Canada, if negative regulation get approved, it will be very sensitive to influence the proportion. Students and parents need reasons to study in USA.

So I am strongly support this regulation get approved.
