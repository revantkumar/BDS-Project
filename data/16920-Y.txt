I oppose the ICEB proposed rule which expands training opportunities for F-1 for Non-Immigrant students with STEM degrees and Cap Gap relief for all eligible F-1 students. This will make it more difficult for American students to get jobs after spending years getting degrees and incurring thousands in student loans! This should not be allowed to happen under any circumstances!
