I strongly SUPPORT this rule.
1)We can not deny the fact that international students have created huge values to U.S. society.
2)Restriction of international students' working chance leads to the lose of competition in U.S..
3)Like me, many international students plan to return to home country after a few years in U.S.. We just want the experience of working abroad.
