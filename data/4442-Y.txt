Luisa Franklin I absolutely SUPPORT this proposal that extends the STEM OPT to 24 months. The reasons are as below.
In history, the rapid growth of US economic mostly depends on the international labors which includes the international students. And these STEM students contribute tremendously in high-tech jobs. In the long run, the high-tech is a critical industry to stimulate the economic growth. Therefore, the 24 month extension for international students is necessary for US Economy growth.
This new OPT extension rule will not take jobs away from Americans, because foreign students have to go through a strict tutorial period which requires the employer to provider time and resource to tutor the new hired international students. Due to the extra expense, employers wouldn't choose international students if there is any qualified US citizens. This also shows how significant it is to have international students working in this nation, because they can help to improve the industry that US citizens are not good at, and therefore create more opportunities for US citizens.
