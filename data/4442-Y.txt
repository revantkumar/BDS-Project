This would help the US keep the American-educated talents to advance OUR technology and science. I highly support this rule. In addition, I would love to see more expansion at the graduate degrees especially the doctorate programs. These are the students who have shown their contributions and abilities through research and schoolwork and most likely to continue to contribute to our future technology. Plus, they do not compete directly with the majority of American job seekers.
