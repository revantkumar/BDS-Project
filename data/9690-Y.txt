I believe the approval of this proposal will be beneficial for the U.S. economy and more importantly the job market in the long term. Therefore, I STRONG SUPPORT this proposal.

Just think what's gonna happen to the U.S. if all these U.S. educated talents excelling in tech have no STEM and have to go to other countries, e.g. Australia, Canada, India, China, U.K., simply because they have better work visa policies. Why should we lose them to those countries after they received american education and make contribution to our rivals? Eventually foreign countries will take lead and beat us and we will lose millions of more jobs in the future!!! Think, people, think!

STEM will not hurt the local graduates' chances if they're the same competent and honestly local student always stand a better chance from a recruiting perspective.
