This proposed rule is quite reasonable and will benefit all stakeholders. For Americans who are concerned their jobs might be replaced, there is a section about "Safeguards for U.S. Workers in Related Fields" that ensures that corporations won't take advantage of this to drive down worker compensation. Therefore, any additional workers will be competing only on their skills and job performance.

America, and corporations in America, need to be globally competitive and hire the best workers. I work as a Software Engineer and I've helped interview people for software jobs and in my experience it's been quite hard to find people who are good enough. We can't afford to hire someone who isn't that good, and we're only working on business software. There are a lot of hard problems out there that are very important. Robots, saving the environment, energy, nanotechnology, etc. There are many fields that America has to be highly competitive in that are much harder than writing business software. We need to be able to hire the best people for the job.
