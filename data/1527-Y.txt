I deeply realize that why this ruke is so important:
1,As one of many international students, i choose a pretty challenging major, comouter science. The best time every week i have is when i do programming with my americans friends, Shane and Stephan. We all hope work together in the future in the same company. We feel thst we will be a good team. If this rule can not pass, i have to say "Goodbye" to my friens and to this countru which i want to work for. 
2. International students are very high educated , but not illegal immigrant. We are here to create innovation but not avoid tax or steal social welfare.
