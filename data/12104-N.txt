American college graduates must take priority over foreign students for the jobs for which they were trained. It makes no sense to extend time for foreign students to work in the U.S. after graduation with a limited number of job openings and an adequate number of citizens qualified to fill them. There is already a program in place for a limited time period. This must not be extended.
