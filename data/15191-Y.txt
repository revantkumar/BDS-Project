Joshua Lowe Professor Matloff's comments are both simple, valid and correct.

If the U.S. indeed "needs" the foreign students to remedy a STEM labor shortage, why do these students need training?

While problems to the world and issues may seem large and complex, the answers are often quite simple.

Train more US workers.

The only way a pilot would be grounded is if he were truly crazy, but if he asked to be grounded, he was then considered sane and would not be grounded"
