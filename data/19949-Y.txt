I strongly SUPPORT the proposal! 

US benefits a lot from her population diversity, needless to say this proposal is to encourage more international STEM student to contribute to US at their best time (20s to 30s), I see no reason why the government would say no to those young and energetic high-tech labor.

On the other hand, competition dose exist, however it is not a bad thing. The international STEM student are not playing low-cost-labor trick to rob job positions. The competition will encourage our citizens to improve themselves. I think the whole society should stop been anti-intellectual.
