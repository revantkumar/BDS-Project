Sandra Anderson The proposed from the Department of Homeland Security to expand the Optional Training program will be a detriment to the American workers. With so many Americans out of work that can't even afford to buy food, what are you thinking? Please take care of our own people before giving it to the foreign workers. This program actually gives employers incentive to hire foreign students because they don't have to pay the employer portion of the payroll taxes or a prevailing wage. Immigration policy should serve the interest of the American worker, not against it. This rule lines the pockets of greedy business owners at the expense of American workers.
