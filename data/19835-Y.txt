I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

Firstly, the development of technology in U.S. needs both Americans and talented STEM students' contribution. With more and more competitive international political situations, development is the most important thing for U.S. to keep the first place. It is the time to talk about how to attract as many as talented STEM students in the U.S., rather than argue the way to keep talented students away from the U.S.

Secondly, company will gain benefits for having people who come from different cultures and show different ways to recognize the world. Having diverse racial and ethnic groups help company have more opportunities to find creative ideas from international students, especially talented students who are in STEM majors.

More importantly, talented international STEM students will help companies understand the demands of their home countries and expand the business of the companies to China, India and some other countries. China and India have the largest population in the world. They are rich resource for companies in the future. Having someone who know their home countries and languages will be a huge benefit for companies.
