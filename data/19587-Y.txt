I support the proposal! It's not only good for international students but most impottantly its also great for United States! There are a lot of international students with GRADUATE DEGREES! How many citizens are still willing to spend 4 to 7 boring years in school to get trained for engineering PhD, physics PhD, or math PhD?? Smart americans are more willing to spend their time in WALL STREET because that earns them huge MONEY! Industry NEEDs these phd people to stay on top of other competitors from OTHER COUNTRIES! Or America wouldn't have enough advantages to be the big brother in the world anymore. Don't be silly. International students are not stealing jobs from Americans, ironically, they're working hard to make America a better country!
