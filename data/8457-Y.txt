Although the laws controlling the H* Visas sounds good, e.g. it has to be equivalent to US wage, no H* will be brought in unless we can prove that we cannot find equivalent US citizen worker, the H* holder has to meet the job criteria and wage displacement, they will not be paid more that US citizen, they have to have a job waiting for them and not be on the bench waiting to find a job, it's all a bunch of bull crap. The lawyers find a way to disqualify the US applicants in the first place, all they have to do is post a job post demanding bi-lingual capability, or put something in there that is so ridiculous that no American citizen can qualify for and viola, you passed the biggest hurdle. Next, you bring the H* visa holders over and park them in some apartment, by the dozens with base pay for just living and surviving while you look for a job for them. The game is so rigged and so unenforceable because our ignorant government is uninformed about the cheating and has not enough enforcement people, that enforcement is next to non-existent. Meanwhile our citizen workers are being replaced at an unprecedented pace. I know because I worked for a small company that brought in 50 H* visa holders within 2 years, all skirting the law. Think about the big companies and how much they are getting away with and then you may get a better picture of the scale of the fraud.
