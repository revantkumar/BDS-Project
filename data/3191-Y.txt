I agree that this proposed rule is beneficial due to the following reasons:
1. USA was built by immigrants. We cannot be hypocritical and oversee the fact that most of these students are intelligent educated human beings who have overcome intense competition & poverty within their own country and want to pursue their very own American dream. Wasn't this exactly what our Pilgrim Fathers and other settlers did?
Canada our friendly neighbor up north already has laws to grant work authorization as long as the duration of a student's program at a university and such programs are also available in other countries.
2. International students boost the economy, specially in and around a university they study. The economy will face a significant hit if we don't have such incentives for international students and we will lose such brilliant minds to other countries.They also have to pay taxes both federal and state and that helps the government in their spending unlike illegal aliens who evade tax.
3. They cannot be unemployed for more than 90 days in their OPT program. They can gain employment only related to their degree obtained here. This means they have to work extremely hard and gain employment and stay unemployed. The point is that they are working hard for it and they have earned it.

Finally can you imagine USA and the world without Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, Albert Einstein and others if they weren't allowed to work and live in the states. USA wouldn't be much without such immigrant workers who contribute so much to this country, the least we can do is give them a chance to pursue their dream.
