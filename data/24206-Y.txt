As a US citizen, I personally think OPT program abuse is too prevailing to be acceptable for US public. However, I do believe there should be common ground as US should retain talented foreign students while preventing abuse
Therefore I suggest the new OPT rule should be improved by these steps:

1) very clear and high enough prevailing wage requirement for employers to recruit students on OPT.
2) set up a black list of companies that abuse OPT and H1b, those in black list will be forever barred from using OPT or H1b program.
3)OPT program should only be available for students from top 50-100 US universities, the current provision "accredited Universities" is too vague. 
I also suggest Chinese students to comment about how to improve the OPT extension as above, in this case, you can at least win support from relatively reasonable people like me
