We really need to focus on bringing our youth into the job market and prepare them for the adult interaction so they can become responsible citizens. The foreign influx are all about wants or total lack of. No want to learn language. No want to be respectful to America. No want to learn how to assimilate into society. These are the big ones. How long before it is about no want to do business with those that do not hire American workers. It is time to vote with our dollars. Thank you
