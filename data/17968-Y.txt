I will NEVER understand why our government would put foreigners ahead of American citizens when it comes to hiring. We have a finite number of jobs and the only reason these companies even consider hiring foreigners is because they will work so cheap. Soon there will be no need to get a college degree since you won't be able to get a job here anyway. Americans will be forced to do the drudge work no one would hire a foreigner to do.

I was at a dinner party not long ago and one of he fellows down the table is an engineer. He said that his engineering company prefers to hire foreign engineers because they will work for half of what an American will.

Out of my seven immediate neighbors, including those across the alley, three of them are Indian engineers and they must be making pretty good money since they all drive more expensive cars than we drive (Lexus, Audi, BMW while we drive a PT Cruiser) and travel back to Indian frequently.

The high tech area we iive in is overrun with Asians. This is not right on any level.

My son is an IT professional and lives in constant fear they will hire a foreigner to replace him as they have done so many others. He said that the foreigners who have been brought into the company are either very difficult to work with or just not up to par with their skills. Consequently, my son finds he has to be indispensable. He works at home a lot which cuts into his family time and he might get calls during the night to fix a glitch or or be called away from the dinner table. He is working about 20 hours a week over his normal 40. I believe in working hard at your job, but there should be a limit on the hours since he is not compensated for anything additional.
