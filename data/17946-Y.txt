Expanding the Optional Practical Training opportunities for foreign students would be a travesty for Americans. It motivates companies to hire foreigners instead of Americans, gives them a tax and wage benefit for doing so, and provides no value or benefit to the USA. It is simply a scam to retain and keep more foreign students in the USA, and decreases job opportunities for U.S. citizens. There is absolutely NO GOOD in this plan for the USA or for American students. 

The only beneficiaries of this stupid idea would be corporations looking to pay CHEAPER LABOR costs to foreign students, most of whom would take almost anything to remain in America. There are MANY REASONS for people to come here and stay here; there is a HUGE and OBVIOUS DAMAGE to Americans to increase this inflow to the USA. 

Anyone who SUPPORTS this ABOMINATION has either been bought off by corporations seeking cheaper labor, or they are interested in DAMAGING America and its citizens! There are no rational reasons otherwise to push this IDIOCY! 

My husband has spent a career in the computer field. He has had to compete with cheaper and less competent competition from India and many other countries who have been trying to flood into our nation. Most potential computer graduates have begun to look for other fields with less cheap foreign competition and thus a decent future.
