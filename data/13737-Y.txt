Make it easier for the educated to stay and work in our country. We are the land of opportunity but our priorities are all wrong. Its not easy to come here legally and we treat those who do terribly; we treat them like criminals! The uneducated who break our laws and enter this country illegally get handouts left and right. Just because we are afraid of more American's losing jobs to foreigners shouldn't cause America to lose out on valuable talent. As long as we maintain fair wages, there should be no problem with companies hiring foreign students who have worked very hard to come here so they can take advantage of the opportunities this great country provides.
