Tom Tarter I strongly support this proposal. This students are paying regular taxes and helping the economy to get better. They are competing in the field and taking the US economy upwards. Overall, it is a great idea to give them the opportunity to have this training for the extended time. Thus I support this STEM extension for 24 months.
