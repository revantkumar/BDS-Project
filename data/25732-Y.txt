I just want wonder how can, DHS, extend 17 month period to 24 month as court ruling states to go through the process and then pass the regulation of stem extension. Court never asked to amend the regulation has been passed in 2008.

Would like to hear on that one of my confusion.

I am an intentional student and good to hear the news that stem period has been extended.
