The taking of money from the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund to finance a program for "visiting" foreign students to advance their job opportunities in the American market is wrong on many levels. For example, the under-funding of the Social Security and Medicare is scheduled for collapse. These foreign students make no contribution to that fund but only take from it. At least offer the same opportunity to US students.
Secondly, the job market is limited already in tech jobs for Americans especially over 35. This guarantees a low wage income for this age group. 
Finally, the 3 year visa opens the door for more violation and loss of accountability which can become a real Homeland Security issue.
Sharing our technology is one thing but to ignore the consequences is reckless.
