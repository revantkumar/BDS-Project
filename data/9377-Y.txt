In a immigrant country like US, the foreigners provide great economic contribution, making the US the greatest country in the world. Since the students had been educated in our education system, It's better to provide them with legal visa support for them to return the favor to US, by working here in the states for a few years. Then the extension of OPT is not only necessary but only we should try to extend it for a longer time, say, 5 years.
