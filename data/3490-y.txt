Yikun Huang I vote for this proposal. I believe this rule will be very important to our U.S people and the people who come to stay at this place.
International students pay a large amount of money for university tuition to the U.S universities and colleges. Besides, they also pay for the rent, the food and other entertainment. If these talented people get a job eventually in the states, they will pay tax as U.S citizens. However, they sometimes do not enjoy the benefit that citizens have. If they can work longer than before under the OPT program, they will in heart contribute more effort than ever because they know that they will not need to leave this country just for 1 year of working experience. They will devote their effort and time to really think about the work and contribute the the employer, which is beneficial to the U.S companies. 
Besides, many international students come to States to study for advanced degrees. They are very talented and I think our government should keep these people because U.S education system trains them. People is the origin of wealth. Why U.S will give away these talented people to our Countries after we train them in a very decent way. Wherever these people go, where will be developed.
I highly recommend that U.S will propose this rule for the OPT extension and give international students and U.S people themselves an opportunity to grow together and develop together.
