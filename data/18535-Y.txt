This concerns me as it will only create a greater surplus of low priced labor in my profession. Where is the benefit here to US citizen workers? The only solution ever proposed seems to be to enable more foreign worker competition for us citizens. I have been in the IT industry for over 20 years, and every year it only gets more difficult for me to stay in this business. I have a family to suupport and the salaries for my type of work have only gone down in the last 10-15 years. I have been out of work multiple times over the last few years for 3-6 months at a time. Enough is enough, I would just once like to see a government action that goes in favor of an American citizen in my business, but I doubt I ever will.
