Science and technology is becoming more and more essential towards people's well being and everyday lives. Promotes of 24 months additional extension for STEM graduate students who hold F-1 status not only brings incentives for more future generation to devote themselves into STEM fields but also provides strong workforce for companies, research institutes, and education facilities for them to work for. 

I strongly support the 24 months extension.
