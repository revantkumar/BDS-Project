You are insulting the intelligence and capability of U.S. citizens when you offer education, training and jobs to foreigners. American citizens can and MUST be trained and educated to fill these jobs. It is NOT the role of the government to allow businesses to import cheaper labor in the guise of "expertise". It is simply a smokescreen that anyone with an average IQ can figure out. NO MORE VISAS until every American has a job.

It is offensive to offer positions at universities in the U.S. when American-born children are dying for those spots and are refused entrance. It is also ridiculous to employ people who send money out of the country to their families. WAKE UP!
