I strongly agree with the arguments in this proposal and believe that extending STEM OPT to 24 months benefits not only the international students, but our country as well. 

The United States has always been a country of immigrants. Generations of them come here, work hard and assimilate with the American people and provide us fuel for economic development as well as international competitiveness. International students are the best source of immigrants for the country, since they come here to pursue education and it'd be ignorant to let them leave with all the skills and knowledge they learned from the best higher education in the world.

International students contribute a lot to our economy and the net benefit of having them in our work force definitely outweighs the concerns about losing job opportunities for us. This is especially true in the technology sector, where most of the top tech companies were founded by immigrants: http://www.businessinsider.com/top-tech-companies-founded-by-foreigners-2014-5 .

I work in one of the highest-valued companies. A lot of my best co-workers at work are international students - they've worked hard and continuously delivered great performance. However, given the impasse on H1B work visa and the cancellation of OPT STEM extension, a lot of them will have to leave the country in the near future. This proposal will affect so many people and companies across the country and a negative outcome will certainly hurt both sides. Therefore, it is timely to pass this proposal to keep the best minds in our country.

I fully support this decision.
