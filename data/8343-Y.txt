I strongly SUPPORT this proposal for the following reasons:
1. Diversity is very important for the companies. Actually it's diversity that make the company to be better equipped with the global economy. It helps thses companies to make best use of a diverse workforce. 
2. There might be some competition between foreign students and local workfource, but I see this as a advantage instead of a disadvantage. Competition helps company to grow and proceed to success.
3. Some foreign students might do some projects that last 2-3 years. And they have to leave the team because of the stem expires. So an extension to stem will help both the company and students to finish the project.
