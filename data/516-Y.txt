As the trend of the previous years shows, skilled students have made huge contributions in the innovation and ground breaking research. Some of the companies in America are still having trouble in seeking for the most suitable person to fill some position which needs a lot of technical skills. Longer OPT will make more skilled students willing to seeking for a job here to support the economic development of America. This even will help everyone live better lives. If the OPT is only 12 months, very less students will stay here to devote themselves in the development of America. From some of the information I know. A lot of companies always love to hire Chinese or Indian people to fill technical skills, as they are very few American would love to do these kind of job. I can not image America will very few foreign skilled students, that would be a really big nightmare!
