F1 students pose little to no threat to the employment of american citizen. Most of the cases company prefer citizen/permanent resident over F1 students because the former requires no sponsorship. F1 students get hired only because there is a desperate need of human resource that goes beyond the supply of citizen, especially in areas of STEM. I work as a software engineer and my company that has around 50% of its employee consisted with foreign students, many of them still being F1. If we choose not to do best to secure them to lawfully work in US, numerous companies like mine will crumble over nights. This will do no good to anyone in US.
