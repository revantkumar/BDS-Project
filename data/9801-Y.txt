As a software engineer working at silicon valley, I strongly believe this regulation will undoubtedly stimulate STEM students to come to study in the U.S and eventually contribute to the development of the technology in the U.S. This will not only become a short-term incentive for foreign students but will also end up being a long-term benefit for this country. Apart from the obvious tax income the students generate for the government, these STEM students help to enhance the competitiveness and leading position of the U.S in the tech marathon against other emerging countries. They maintain and improve today's dynamic, competition and innovative technical workforce. Without the OPT extension, the willingness of STEM students to come to the U.S will largely degrade, resulting in the shortage of manpower for tech development. I strongly believe it is the United State's core value to accept diversity, as well as grow with the challenges, and not to be intimidated by the surge of success we have experienced these past decades. People come to the U.S in pursuit of a dream. A dream where they could contribute to the society and make the most out of their profession. If this simple aspiration is bereft, then I do not see why the U.S would proudly state itself as the free and equal country as it has always been proud of. Thus, I firmly believe that it is a positive influence and a beneficial policy for STEM students to contribute their full time here with the OPT extension. As the above reasonings exemplify, we are all currently contributing to turn the wheel of tech innovation forward in the U.S. Concretely, we have come to a stage where we would only require more hands to keep this historic moment moving. It is definitely not a good idea to reverse the pivot in the wrong direction.
