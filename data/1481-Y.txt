A good policy should not treat majors differently. If this law is going to pass, it should let all the F1 students get OPT extension rather than only STEM students. A lot of liberal arts students find it hard to stay in the US and we should treat them as equal. We not only need foreign students to be able to contribute to our society in fields like industrial production and computer science, but also need people who can improve our happiness and cultural integration.
