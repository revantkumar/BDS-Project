I strongly support this rule for the following reasons:

1 American culture value equality so much , if America don't give chance to foreign students to work here, then America is not as equal as expected.
2 This rule will attract more talented students to study here, it's good for US education and economy .
3 Hard-working Americans won't lose their jobs because foreigners work here,because gold will glitter forever, and Americans are not enough to make America a better country, they have to work together with foreigners.
