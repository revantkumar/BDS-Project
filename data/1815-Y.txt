Jessie Jacinski OPT students are completely different from illegal immigrants. To those people who said international students are using the benefits paid by US citizens, the truth is international students pay tuitions to US universities when they are in school. After they start working on OPT, they are making money and creating values for the country. In one sentence, they are creating more jobs for americans rather than taking jobs from americans. Besides, they also pay taxes, no less than US citizens. However, those young students do not usually have as good benefits and social well being as US citizens. We should do favor to these young, well educated people who are helping our economy and society. As a result, I strongly support the rule.
