While the economy seems to be improving, the benefits are quite lopsided. As an IT job holder, it's not all sun and roses. The big problem is cheap and captive foreign labor under the auspices of work visas(H-1B, L-1, OPT+, etc). 

There are still too many STEM workers unemployed or not using their degree/training! This end around H-1B visa limits helps only the IT and technology intensive companies who are already doing very well. The empty promises to Middle Class America are, even more, a bitter drink to those who actually work for a living. See the two year free consulting demanded of soon-to-be laid off IT employees of a S.E. US bank. 

When will the unqualified Indian IT employee problem be exposed for what it is, as a means of hiring cheap and docile automatons demanded by intellectually insecure and unimaginative U.S. executive ranks?
