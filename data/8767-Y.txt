Yilun Wu Opt is a good opportunity for international student to have a great beginning of their career. They can learn something different from school but more than school. But for now the opt time is too long for them to get a job and work. Today it is not easy to get a job within such a short time. And even if they also find a job, the current opt time is not long enough for them to gain good work experience. I think make opt extension be longer is necessary for all. It will improve the level of US education..
