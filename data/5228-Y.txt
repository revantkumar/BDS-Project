Luxi Yang Would you please add Public Health (51.2299) to STEM list? Here are several reasons.

1. Public health definitely falls under the umbrella of STEM. It belongs to health science. I can see other health related majors in the STEM list, but public health is missing.

2. Public health is a broad definition including epidemiology, biostatistics and environment. I can find all of these majors in the STEM list except for public health. This is not logical and reasonable.

3. Graduates from public health major are currently working in different healthcare areas including hospitals, healthcare research institutes and pharmaceutical/biotech companies. We are contributing to human health and are highly in demand.

Thanks
