There is no doubt that OPT extension is must in response to the dramatically increased international student/professional body (much larger than in 2008). Due to the limited H1B positions available, a large proportional of international students would only have one year to work, which is far from ideal for a few obvious reasons. First, a project, at least in my fields (biomedical and clinical), would generally last more than a year and typically 3-5 years(from start to completion). Without participating in the entire process of a project, you could barely get the whole picture and it would be a loss for the company to train a new personnel to continue the project. Secondly, even if the project could be finished in one year, with only that account of experience it is definitely not enough to make you independent and competitive for the job market in your hometown. 

I also like the new addition allowing people with a prior STEM degree for OPT extension, although I personally don't need it. For example, it is very common nowadays for someone with a PhD in biology to continue with a Master in public Health(MPH). While the former is a STEM major, but not the latter. Without the new proposal, those highly educated persons would only have one year OPT. This is not fair to them. Imagine that they have spent years in US for advanced education, but might have to leave US after a year due to visa issue. Therefore, I highly support this new idea. And I don't know if there is a better way to take the years of education / type of advanced degrees into consideration as well.
