This rule does not only benefit those who are seeking for stem work, but it actually benefit those big stem companies like Google, Apple and those big names that all the US have heard. If those high tech companies cannot hire enough good new college graduate students they need, the US will lose its advantage of these fields to some other countries like China ( we all know that companies like Baidu or Baba are catching up really fast). By supporting this rule, we are supporting the future of US economy.
