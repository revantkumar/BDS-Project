I support this rule. US is the country of immigrants. Immigrants have contributed immensely to this economy. Take a look at the top tech companies and how many skilled foreigners are there in the top management. This rule would just give international students a fair chance to apply for H1B and contribute to the economy. There are many who want to start their own company and create employment here. If a person has superior quality of work, he will get hired. That is what should matter. The quality of work.Many American students who have those attributes of quality get hired anyways irrespective of who they are competing against.
