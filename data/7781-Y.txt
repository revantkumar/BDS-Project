Allan Yin I strong embrace this proposal because it will benefit our nation in the long run.

Allowing international students to stay in the US will actually create more job opportunities to the Americans because they are setting up more and more start-ups to provide jobs to the Americans.

International students will greatly contribute to the development of the US. It competitive in the job market and only the best can find a position. If all the international students are drawn out, their positions will be substituted by less competent Americans, which is not good in the long run, especially for private companies.
