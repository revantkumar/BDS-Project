I strongly support the expanding of OPT. OPT gives students a chance to apply what they learn in school back to the US society. It will help boost economy and in the long run create more jobs for US citizens. It will also help US further attract STEM talents all around the world and keep its leadership in innovation.

In a lot of the comments I saw the following quotes.
"OPT denied American workers more than 430,000 jobs during the years 2009-2013; and
OPT removed $4 billion from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds."

However, I don't find these convincing at all. 
There's no evidence that American workers were denied because of OPT, not to mention STEM OPT. Companies hire people by their qualifications. Why would a company hire an international student and go through all the trouble of sponsoring him/her work visa later if they could find a qualified American worker?
