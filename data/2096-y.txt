Darl Easton Please reject extending the OPT from the current one year to three years. It's great that many students come to American Colleges and Universities for an education, but it is also important to the economy of their native countries to return there to apply their education in a technical field. One year post education is more than adequate to experience the practical application of the education in a technical field. Extending OPT to three years can be detrimental to U.S. citizen students seeking jobs in the same field, and provides corporations less incentive to hire them.
