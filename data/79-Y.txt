This is an exciting news! It really helps US corporates to attract more international talents and boom their business since everyone wants to go globally right now. International employees will increase the company's diversity, and let the company better understand their customers in other countries. And on other hand, if a company wants to extend their business, instead of hiring on other countries, companies could send their own employee who is much more familiar with their business back to their hometown, it definitely a win-win solution without no harm.
