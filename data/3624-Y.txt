Anna Jackson I really like this proposed rule. In retrospect, the USA becomes a great country due to its openness to international talents to a large extent. Currently, US economy gradually recovers from the Subprime mortgage crisis, and there is an increased demand for talents. IT industry contributes a lot to the economic recovery and it has an ever-increasing demand for talents. The population of US stem students are sufficient to feed the need.
