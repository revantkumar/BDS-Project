I think the new STEM OPT rule can help ensure that the competitive in attracting international STEM students to study in the United States and legally remain in the United States to work fulltime after graduation in their field of study.

It is not only beneficial for the international student but also companies which require the right technical skill sets from entry level position as well; 

I personally have been through the transaction from a full time student to a working student under OPT status. I have got much more in depth knowledge within the IT industry and all the knowledge I have learned from college, I was able to use or pick up more in my job; On the other hand, my company is also benefit from the work that I perform and the knowledge that I have from my undergraduate and graduate study; I am also a recruiter from my company where I went to Campus Career fair and talked to students. There are a lot of international students that we talked to and found out that they have talent, skill set and interests in working in the states, but because of the visa status constrains that they don't have a lot of opportunities. However, a lot of companies need the skill sets and people but they are also constrained because they cannot sponsor a working visa. Having the STEM OPT extension will be a double win for both parties and at the end.
