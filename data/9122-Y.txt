I observed many brilliant minds that could not stay and contribute their intelligence here in US due to some of the out-dated visa policies. Our founding fathers are immigrants themselves. US was,still is and will be an immigrant country, attracting all the top talents and let them stay. I think this proposal is one significant step toward to brighter US future.
