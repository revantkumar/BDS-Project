I strongly SUPPORT the proposal because of the following reasons:
1. International students can make huge contributions for the U.S country. The more direct contribution is that they can purchase lots of good to improve the economy of the country. The long term contribution is that international students are fresh blood to this country. They will make profit for U.S. once they are employed. Once the economy of the country is increasing, more job positions will be created!
2. Diversity is very important for U.S., which is an immigration country. Compared with European countries, we can known that international intelligence is an important factor that U.S. is developing so good! Asian countries also learn from U.S. to have more and more international students to make them develop!
3. Lots of international students will create an environment of competition. It make make domestic citizens to work harder to make contribution of their country. If there is no competition, people will get lazy. They don't want to work hard but only play hard! Then where is the future of this country?
