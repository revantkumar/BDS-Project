Those who oppose this proposal mainly concerns that nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees will take away work opportunities that supposed to belong to local Americans, but that's not true and falls in a wrong thinking model on this issue. 
Suppose the work opportunities are in a constant number, the larger distribution to nonimmigrant students will decrease local Americans could get. However, work opportunities are not something naturally held in land with limited quantities, it is created by the hard work and intelligence of people. Experiences in the past have shown that contributions from nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees can benefit all Americans by creating more job opportunities.
After a long period of study in Universities in U.S., those STEM students have accumulated a lot knowledge and experiences and OPT is almost the last investment before a fruitful production to pay back from them. It is unwise at all to drive them away at this time. The extension of OPT time will surely make a better consequence to all Americans because it provides STEM students more chances to contribute as well as more opportunities to select valuable candidates making further contributions for ICEB.
Those who oppose this proposal should learn more to broaden their own vision and polish their own brain if they want to live a better life, rather than blame others or any immigrant policy.
