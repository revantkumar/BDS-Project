I think this is great and totally necessary. I've seen that a lot of talented people has to leave because they can't get working authorization in one year. And the company has to try all means to get them back. Or they just let them leave America and spend a lot of money and time to try to hire and train a new people, but still they may face this situation later. It's really sad seeing our co-worker leave. Stem students can make a great contribution to US's economy and technology. I do believe that it's very important to find ways to keep them. Without this policy, many intelligent people might be forced to leave the country with our technology, that is not good to us.
