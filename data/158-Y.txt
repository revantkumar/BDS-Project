I do believe that prolong the OPT time for F1 students will benefit Americans.

The first is that, by hiring OPT students, American companies can spend less money on their employees, while have same productivity. This will reduce the budget for American companies, and especially beneficial to star-up companies.

Secondly, because of a longer OPT time, American companies will have more opportunities to find better potential employees. But this doesn't mean OPT students deprive job opportunities from native Americans: F1 students need to get H1B after OPT to work in America. However, when applying H1B, it requires that the job "needs special skill from the forefinger, and the company can not find suitable employees from American citizens". This shows that these jobs only suitable for certain expertise foreigners, not for most native Americans.

Thirdly, extending OPT time will have commercial beneficence for American society. Most OPT jobs are in lowest wage, or even no salary, while the F1 students still need to pay rent and bills to stay in America, as well as tax. Those fees will help to construct local communities, and increase tax incomes.

Last but not least, prolonging the OPT time, which means a better opportunity to have some American working experience, makes US more appealing to international students than other countries in the world. Nowadays, more and more F1 students choose to comeback home country instead of staying in American and becomes an immigrant. What they need is working experience but not a green card. So giving more opportunities to get working experience is extremely appealing for international students to choose the destination country. And more international students means: HUGE income for American education system!
