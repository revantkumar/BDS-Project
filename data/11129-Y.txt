I Strongly SUPPORT the proposal based on following reasons:

1. The United States should keep those who haved learned from USA Universities and make them contributing to the US Society with their professional technical skills.

2. Diversity has always been a good thing.

3. Though to some extent, the competition exists, it has more positive effects rather than a threat to native citizens. The students with OPT status usually are hired in high technical skill required area and will never be a threat to US Citizens who depend on basic jobs. These OPT students will contribute to the US society and highly possible create more job opportunities to US Citizens with their business.
